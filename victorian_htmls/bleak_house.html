<p/>PREFACE


<p/>A Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me, as one of a
company of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under
any suspicions of lunacy, that the Court of Chancery, though the
shining subject of much popular prejudice -LRB-at which point I thought
the judge's eye had a cast in my direction-RRB-, was almost immaculate.
There had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) admitted, a trivial blemish or so in its rate of
progress, but this was exaggerated and had been entirely owing to the
<div class="bookquote">``parsimony of the public,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which guilty public, it appeared, had been
until lately bent in the most determined manner on by no means
enlarging the number of Chancery judges appointed--I believe by
Richard the Second, but any other king will do as well.

<p/>This seemed to me too profound a joke to be inserted in the body of
this book or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to
Mr. Vholes, with one or other of whom I think it must have
originated. In such mouths I might have coupled it with an apt
quotation from one of Shakespeare's sonnets:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My nature is subdued
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
Pity me, then, and wish I were renewed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)</div><p/>But as it is wholesome that the parsimonious public should know what
has been doing, and still is doing, in this connexion, I mention here
that everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of
Chancery is substantially true, and within the truth. The case of
Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence,
made public by a disinterested person who was professionally
acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning to
end. At the present moment -LRB-August, 1853-RRB- there is a suit before the
court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from
thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in
which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand
pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is -LRB-I am assured-RRB- no
nearer to its termination now than when it was begun. There is
another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was
commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than
double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in
costs. If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I
could rain them on these pages, to the shame of--a parsimonious
public.

<p/>There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark. The
possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been denied
since the death of Mr. Krook; and my good friend Mr. Lewes -LRB-quite
mistaken, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) soon found, in supposing the thing to have been
abandoned by all authorities-RRB- published some ingenious letters to me
at the time when that event was chronicled, arguing that spontaneous
combustion could not possibly be. I have no need to observe that I do
not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers and that before I
wrote that description I took pains to investigate the subject. There
are about thirty cases on record, of which the most famous, that of
the Countess Cornelia de Baudi Cesenate, was minutely investigated
and described by Giuseppe Bianchini, a prebendary of Verona,
otherwise distinguished in letters, who published an account of it at
Verona in 1731, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giuseppe</b></font>) afterwards republished at Rome. The
appearances, beyond all rational doubt, observed in that case are the
appearances observed in Mr. Krook's case. The next most famous
instance happened at Rheims six years earlier, and the historian in
that case is Le Cat, one of the most renowned surgeons produced by
France. The subject was a woman, whose husband was ignorantly
convicted of having murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but on solemn appeal to a higher
court, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was acquitted because it was shown upon the evidence that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had died the death of which this name of spontaneous combustion
is given. I do not think it necessary to add to these notable facts,
and that general reference to the authorities which will be found at
page 30, vol. ii.,* the recorded opinions and experiences of
distinguished medical professors, French, English, and Scotch, in
more modern days, contenting myself with observing that I shall not
abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable
spontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences
are usually received.**

<p/>In Bleak House I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of
familiar things.

<p/>*Transcriber's note. This referred to a specific page in
the printed book. In this Project Gutenberg edition the
pertinent information is in Chapter XXX, paragraph 90.

<p/>** Another case, very clearly described by a dentist,
occurred at the town of Columbus, in the United States
of America, quite recently. The subject was a German who
kept a liquor-shop and was an inveterate drunkard.




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>In Chancery


<p/>London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting
in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in
the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of
the earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,
forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn
Hill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black
drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown
snowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of
the sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;
splashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one
another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing
their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other
foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke
-LRB-if this day ever broke-RRB-, adding new deposits to the crust upon crust
of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and
accumulating at compound interest.

<p/>Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and
meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers
of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great -LRB-and dirty-RRB- city.
Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping
into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and
hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales
of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient
Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog
in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,
down in his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of
his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) shivering little `prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the
bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog
all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the
misty clouds.

<p/>Gas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as
the sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman
and ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their
time--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling
look.

<p/>The raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the
muddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,
appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old
corporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln's Inn
Hall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) High Court of Chancery.

<p/>Never can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire
too deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which
this High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds
this day in the sight of heaven and earth.

<p/>On such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be
sitting here--as here he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) is--with a foggy glory round his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) head,
softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a
large advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an
interminable brief, and outwardly directing his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) contemplation to the
lantern in the roof, where he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) can see nothing but fog. On such an
afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar
ought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten
thousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on
slippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running
their goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and
making a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On
such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or
three of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a
fortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a
long matted well -LRB-but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom
of it-RRB- between the registrar's red table and the silk gowns, with
bills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,
issues, references to masters, masters' reports, mountains of costly
nonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting
candles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it
would never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their
colour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the
uninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in
the door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the
drawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the
Lord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it
and where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the
Court of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted
lands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every
madhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined
suitor with his (<font color='blue'><b>lunatic</b></font>) slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and
begging through the round of every man's acquaintance, which gives to
monied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so
exhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain
and breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its
practitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the
warning, <div class="bookquote">``Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come
here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>practitioners</b></font>)</div><p/>Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor's court this murky afternoon
besides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three
counsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before
mentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;
and there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or
whatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,
for no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce -LRB-the
cause in hand-RRB-, which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The
short-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of
the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when
Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on
a seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained
sanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is
always in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting
some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) favour. Some say
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for
certain because no one cares. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carries some small litter in a
reticule which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) documents, principally consisting of
paper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in
custody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application <div class="bookquote">``to
purge himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) contempt,''  (<font color='red'><b>A prisoner</b></font>)</div>which, being a solitary surviving
executor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts
of which it is not pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>executor</b></font>) had ever any knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>executor</b></font>) is
not at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his (<font color='blue'><b>executor</b></font>) prospects in life
are ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from
Shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at
the close of the day's business and who can by no means be made to
understand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) existence
after making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself
in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out <div class="bookquote">``My
Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>the judge</b></font>)</div>in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) rising.
A few lawyers' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger
on the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal
weather a little.

<p/>Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in
course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it
means. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been
observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five
minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the
premises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;
innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people
have died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found
themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how
or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the
suit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new
rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown
up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the
other world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and
grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone
out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere
bills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth
perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) brains out at a
coffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags
its dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.

<p/>Jarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good
that has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke
in the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out
of it. Every Chancellor was <div class="bookquote">``in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Every Chancellor</b></font>)</div>for somebody or other, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
was counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by
blue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee
after dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of
fleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it
neatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said
that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
observed, <div class="bookquote">``or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.
Blowers'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and
purses.

<p/>How many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched
forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide
question. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty
warrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many
shapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks' Office who has
copied his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that
eternal heading, no man's nature has been made better by it. In
trickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under
false pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never
come to good. The very solicitors' boys who have kept the wretched
suitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,
Mizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments
until dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into
themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause
has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a
distrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) own mother and a contempt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) own kind. Chizzle,
Mizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising
themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter
and see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when
Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and
sharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the
ill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history
from the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted
into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad
course, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some
off-hand manner never meant to go right.

<p/>Thus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the
Lord High Chancellor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) High Court of Chancery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tangle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something
restless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mlud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tangle</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and
Jarndyce than anybody. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is famous for it--supposed never to have
read anything else since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) left school.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you nearly concluded your argument?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tangle</b></font>)</div>is
the reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>says
the Chancellor with a slight smile.

<p/>Eighteen of Mr. Tangle's learned friends, each armed with a little
summary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a
pianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places
of obscurity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>says the
Chancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a
mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come
to a settlement one of these days.

<p/>The Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward
in a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, <div class="bookquote">``My lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Maces, bags,
and purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from
Shropshire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In reference,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and
Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``to the young girl--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jarndyce/Fitz Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Begludship's pardon--boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jarndyce/Fitz Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tangle prematurely. <div class="bookquote">``In
reference,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, <div class="bookquote">``to the
young girl and boy, the two young people'' (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Tangle crushed--<div class="bookquote">``whom
I directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private
room, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of
making the order for their residing with their uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tangle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tangle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tangle</b></font>) legs again. <div class="bookquote">``Begludship's pardon--dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With their'' (<font color='red'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)</div>--Chancellor looking through his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) double eye-glass at the
papers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) desk--<div class="bookquote">``grandfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Begludship's pardon--victim of rash action--brains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a counsel</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,
fully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Will
your lordship allow me? I appear for him (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) is a cousin, several
times removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in
what exact remove he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) is a cousin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) IS a cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a counsel</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaving this address -LRB-delivered like a sepulchral message-RRB- ringing in
the rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog
knows him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) no more. Everybody looks for him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>). Nobody can see him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will speak with both the young people,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>says the Chancellor anew,
<div class="bookquote">``and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their
cousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my
seat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is
presented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner's conglomeration
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from
Shropshire ventures another remonstrative <div class="bookquote">``My lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>but the
Chancellor, being aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), has dexterously vanished. Everybody
else quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with
heavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old
woman marches off with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) documents; the empty court is locked up.
If all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has
caused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a
great funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the
parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!




<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>In Fashion


<p/>It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same
miry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we
may pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the
world of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent
and usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange
games through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the
knight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen
shall begin to turn prodigiously!

<p/>It is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which
has its limits too -LRB-as your Highness shall find when you have made
the tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond-RRB-, it is a
very little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and
true people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is
that it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller's cotton and fine
wool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot
see them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and
its growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.

<p/>My Lady Dedlock has returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) house in town for a few days
previous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) departure for Paris, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship intends to
stay some weeks, after which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) movements are uncertain. The
fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,
and it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to
be unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) calls, in
familiar conversation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``place''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in Lincolnshire. The waters are
out in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been
sapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile
in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in
it and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.
My Lady Dedlock's place has been extremely dreary. The weather for
many a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,
and the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman's axe can make no
crash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave
quagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in
the moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards
the green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the
falling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock's own windows is
alternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases
on the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and
the heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged
pavement, called from old time the Ghost's Walk, all night. On
Sundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit
breaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste
as of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock -LRB-who is
childless-RRB-, looking out in the early twilight from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) boudoir at a
keeper's lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed
panes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a
woman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a
wrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of
temper. My Lady Dedlock says she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has been <div class="bookquote">``bored to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Therefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in
Lincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the
rabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures
of the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp
walls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along
the old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come
forth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is
omniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet
undertake to say.

<p/>Sir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier
baronet than he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) family is as old as the hills, and infinitely
more respectable. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) has a general opinion that the world might get
on without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) would on
the whole admit nature to be a good idea -LRB-a little low, perhaps, when
not enclosed with a park-fence-RRB-, but an idea dependent for its
execution on your great county families. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) is a gentleman of strict
conscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on
the shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather
than give occasion for the least impeachment of his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) integrity. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) is
an honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely
prejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.

<p/>Sir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet
sixty-seven. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a
little stiffly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is of a worthy presence, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) light-grey hair
and whiskers, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fine shirt-frill, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pure-white waistcoat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ceremonious,
stately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
personal attractions in the highest estimation. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gallantry to my
Lady, which has never changed since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), is the one little
touch of romantic fancy in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) for love. A whisper still goes about that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
had not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had enough and could dispense with any more. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had
beauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to
portion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to
these, soon floated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has
been at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of
the fashionable tree.

<p/>How Alexander wept when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) had no more worlds to conquer, everybody
knows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having
been rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered
HER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,
mood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of
fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the
trophies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) victory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is perfectly well-bred. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) could be
translated to heaven to-morrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) might be expected to ascend
without any rapture.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet
in its autumn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has a fine face--originally of a character that
would be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into
classicality by the acquired expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fashionable state. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is
so, but that <div class="bookquote">``the most is made,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as the Honourable Bob Stables has
frequently asserted upon oath, <div class="bookquote">``of all her (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) points.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob</b></font>)</div>The same
authority observes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is perfectly got up and remarks in
commendation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hair especially that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is the best-groomed
woman in the whole stud.

<p/>With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) perfections on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head, my Lady Dedlock has come up
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) place in Lincolnshire -LRB-hotly pursued by the fashionable
intelligence-RRB- to pass a few days at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) house in town previous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
departure for Paris, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship intends to stay some weeks,
after which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) movements are uncertain. And at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) house in town,
upon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned
old gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of
Chancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the
Dedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) office with that name
outside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror's
trick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across
the hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the
rooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of
it--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman
is conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady's presence.

<p/>The old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made
good thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic
wills, and to be very rich. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is surrounded by a mysterious halo of
family confidences, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is known to be the silent depository.
There are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of
parks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer
noble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of
Mr. Tulkinghorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is of what is called the old school--a phrase
generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and
wears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One
peculiarity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) black clothes and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) black stockings, be they
silk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive
to any glancing light, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) dress is like himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) never converses
when not professionally consulted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is found sometimes, speechless
but quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country
houses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the
fashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) and
where half the Peerage stops to say <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with
the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) knowledge.

<p/>Sir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.
Tulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) which is
always agreeable to Sir Leicester; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) receives it as a kind of
tribute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) likes Mr. Tulkinghorn's dress; there is a kind of tribute
in that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general
way, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the
legal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.

<p/>Has Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may
not, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in
everything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one
of the leaders and representatives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) little world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) supposes
herself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of
ordinary mortals--seeing herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) glass, where indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) looks
so. Yet every dim little star revolving about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) maid to
the manager of the Italian Opera, knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) weaknesses, prejudices,
follies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a
calculation and as nice a measure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) moral nature as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
dressmaker takes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new
custom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new
dwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are
deferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects
of nothing but prostration before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), who can tell you how to manage
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) all their
lives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,
lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook
all and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet
of the majestic Lilliput. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to address our people, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Blaze Sparkle jewellers meaning rest</b></font>)</div>say Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady
Dedlock and the rest--<div class="bookquote">``you must remember that you are not dealing
with the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest
place, and their weakest place is such a place.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To make this
article go down, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sheen</b></font>)</div>say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to
their friends the manufacturers, <div class="bookquote">``you must come to us, because we
know where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it
fashionable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sheen the manufacturers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you want to get this print upon the tables of my
high connexion, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sladdery</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, <div class="bookquote">``or if you
want to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,
sir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of
my high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for
I have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,
sir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my
finger'' (<font color='red'><b>the librarian</b></font>)</div>--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not
exaggerate at all.

<p/>Therefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the
Dedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) may.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady's cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.
Tulkinghorn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Leicester</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Leicester</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Leicester</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It has been on again to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,
shading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) face with a hand-screen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be useless to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady with the dreariness of the
place in Lincolnshire still upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whether anything has been
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>replies
Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor ever will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady.

<p/>Sir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It
is a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be
sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) part
in which was the only property my Lady brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has a
shadowy impression that for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a
cause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous
accident. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should
involve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of
confusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of
other somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal
settlement -LRB-humanly speaking-RRB- of everything. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is upon the whole
of a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) countenance to
any complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the
lower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Tulkinghorn, <div class="bookquote">``and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the
troublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any
new proceedings in a cause'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no
more responsibility than necessary--<div class="bookquote">``and further, as I see you are
going to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of
the fashionable intelligence was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) Lady.-RRB-

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn takes out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) papers, asks permission to place them
on a golden talisman of a table at my Lady's elbow, puts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
spectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady interrupts, requesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to miss as many of the formal
horrors as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) can.

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn glances over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) spectacles and begins again lower
down. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) attention. Sir
Leicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a
stately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging
among the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my
Lady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,
being priceless but small. My Lady, changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) position, sees the
papers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer
still--asks impulsively, <div class="bookquote">``Who copied that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady's animation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
unusual tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it what you people call law-hand?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) asks, looking full at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) careless way again and toying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) screen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite. Probably'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) speaks--<div class="bookquote">``the
legal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was
formed. Why do you ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
face. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, <div class="bookquote">``Eh? What
do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,
<div class="bookquote">``that Lady Dedlock is ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>my Lady murmurs with white lips, <div class="bookquote">``only that; but it is like
the faintness of death. Don't speak to me. Ring, and take me to my
room!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>A Progress


<p/>I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of
these pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can
remember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my
doll when we were alone together, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you
know very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And so
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beautiful
complexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I
think, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) every
one of my secrets.

<p/>My dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared
to open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.
It almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me
when I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and
say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) great
chair, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all I had noticed since we parted. I had always
rather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of
noticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to
understand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.
When I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But
even that may be my vanity.

<p/>I was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the
princesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my
godmother. At least, I only knew her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) as such. She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was a good, good
woman! She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning
prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there
were lectures; and never missed. She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was handsome; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) had
ever smiled, would have been -LRB-I used to think-RRB- like an angel--but she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
never smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was always grave and strict. She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was so very good
herself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) frown
all her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) life. I felt so different from her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), even making every
allowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so
poor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--no, could never even love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as I wished. It made me very
sorry to consider how good she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was and how unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I was, and
I used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I
talked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved
my godmother as I ought to have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) and as I felt I must have
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) if I had been a better girl.

<p/>This made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally
was and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at
ease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing
that helped it very much.

<p/>I had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa
either, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a
black frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama's
grave. I had never been told where it was. Yet I had never been
taught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than
once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our
only servant, who took my light away when I was in bed -LRB-another very
good woman, but austere to me-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had only said, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, good
night!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and gone away and left me.

<p/>Although there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I
was a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther
Summerson, I knew none of them at home. All of them were older than
I, to be sure -LRB-I was the youngest there by a good deal-RRB-, but there
seemed to be some other separation between us besides that, and
besides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more
than I did. One of them in the first week of my going to the school
-LRB-I remember it very well-RRB- invited me home to a little party, to my
great joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me,
and I never went. I never went out at all.

<p/>It was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other
birthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other
birthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one
another--there were none on mine. My birthday was the most melancholy
day at home in the whole year.

<p/>I have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me -LRB-as I know
it may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed I
don't-RRB-, my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My
disposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such
a wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the
quickness of that birthday.

<p/>Dinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table
before the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another
sound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don't know how
long. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the
table at my godmother, and I saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) face, looking gloomily at me,
<div class="bookquote">``It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no
birthday, that you had never been born!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear godmother, tell
me, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``Ask me no more, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do pray tell me something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>). Do now, at last, dear
godmother, if you please! What did I do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>)? How did I lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>)?
Why am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault,
dear godmother? No, no, no, don't go away. Oh, speak to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
dress and was kneeling to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) had been saying all the while,
<div class="bookquote">``Let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But now she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) stood still.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the
midst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp
hers or to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew
it as she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
raised me, sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) chair, and standing me before her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), said slowly
in a cold, low voice--I see her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) knitted brow and pointed
finger--<div class="bookquote">``Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.
The time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this
better and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can. I have
forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--but her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) face did not relent--<div class="bookquote">``the wrong she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did to me,
and I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever
know--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself,
unfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil
anniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon
your head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave
all other people to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who will do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unhappy child that
greatest kindness. Now, go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)--so frozen
as I was!--and added this, <div class="bookquote">``Submission, self-denial, diligent work,
are the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You
are different from other children, Esther, because you were not born,
like them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll's cheek
against mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my
bosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my
sorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody's
heart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me.

<p/>Dear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together
afterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my
birthday and confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) that I would try as hard as ever I could
to repair the fault I had been born with -LRB-of which I confessedly felt
guilty and yet innocent-RRB- and would strive as I grew up to be
industrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some
one, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not
self-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very
thankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to
my eyes.

<p/>There! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.

<p/>I felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more
after the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
house which ought to have been empty, that I found her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) more difficult
of approach, though I was fervently grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) in my heart, than
ever. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in
the same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) daughter, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was proud, who came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) once a
fortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very
diligent.

<p/>One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books
and portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was
gliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the
parlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), I found--which was
very unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking
gentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold
watch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) little finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div>said my godmother in an undertone, <div class="bookquote">``is the child.''  (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
said in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) naturally stern way of speaking, <div class="bookquote">``This is Esther, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman put up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye-glasses to look at me and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come
here, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shook hands with me and asked me to take off my
bonnet, looking at me all the while. When I had complied, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and afterwards <div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye-glasses and
folding them in a red case, and leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm-chair,
turning the case about in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) two hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gave my godmother a nod.
Upon that, my godmother said, <div class="bookquote">``You may go upstairs, Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div>And I
made him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) my curtsy and left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/>It must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,
when one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was
reading aloud, and she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was listening. I had come down at nine o'clock
as I always did to read the Bible to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), and was reading from St.
John how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) finger in the
dust, when they brought the sinful woman to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>).

<p/>``So when they continued asking him (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) lifted up himself and said
unto them, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) that is without sin among you, let him (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) first cast a
stone at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was stopped by my godmother's rising, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) head,
and crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,
<div class="bookquote">''`Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) find you sleeping. And
what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div><p/>In an instant, while she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) stood before me repeating these words, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
fell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) voice had
sounded through the house and been heard in the street.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was laid upon her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) bed. For more than a week she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) lay there, little
altered outwardly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) old handsome resolute frown that I so
well knew carved upon her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) face. Many and many a time, in the day and
in the night, with my head upon the pillow by her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) that my whispers
might be plainer to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), prayed for her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>),
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) blessing and forgiveness, entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) to give me
the least sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) knew or heard me. No, no, no. Her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) face was
immovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) frown remained
unsoftened.

<p/>On the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman in
black with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs.
Rachael, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in the same place, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had never gone
away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Kenge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you may remember it, my child; Kenge
and Carboy, Lincoln's Inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I replied that I remembered to have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) once before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray be seated--here near me. Don't distress yourself; it's of no
use. Mrs. Rachael, I needn't inform you who were acquainted with the
late Miss Barbary's affairs, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) means die with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) and that
this young lady, now her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aunt is dead--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to
be gained by it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge smoothly, <div class="bookquote">``Aunt in fact, though not
in law. Don't distress yourself! Don't weep! Don't tremble! Mrs.
Rachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--Jarndyce and
Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rachael/Rachael</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rachael.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) eye-glasses,
<div class="bookquote">``that our young friend--I BEG you won't distress yourself!--never
heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/>I shook my head, wondering even what it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
glasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
were petting something. <div class="bookquote">``Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits
known? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of
Chancery practice. In which -LRB-I would say-RRB- every difficulty, every
contingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known
in that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause
that could not exist out of this free and great country. I should
say that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs.
Rachael'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) addressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) because I appeared
inattentive<div class="bookquote">''--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty
THOUSAND POUNDS!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) chair.

<p/>I felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely
unacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even
then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) really never heard of the cause!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge.
<div class="bookquote">``Surprising!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Barbary, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rachael/Rachael</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Rachael, <div class="bookquote">``who is now among the
Seraphim--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rachael/Rachael</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rachael/Rachael</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge politely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knows, from any teaching she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) has had here, nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the
point,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>addressing me. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Barbary, your sole relation -LRB-in fact
that is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none-RRB- being
deceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs.
Rachael--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rachael/Rachael</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rachael quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>assented Mr. Kenge; <div class="bookquote">''--that Mrs. Rachael should charge
herself with your maintenance and support -LRB-I beg you won't distress
yourself-RRB-, you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer
which I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and
which, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the
lamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow
that I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly
humane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself
by any stretch of my professional caution?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, leaning
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) chair again and looking calmly at us both.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) own voice. I
couldn't wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great
importance to every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) uttered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) listened to himself with
obvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) own music
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) head or rounded a sentence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) hand. I was very much
impressed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)--even then, before I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) formed himself on
the model of a great lord who was his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) client and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) was
generally called Conversation Kenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``being aware of the--I would say,
desolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) at a
first-rate establishment where her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) education shall be completed,
where her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) comfort shall be secured, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) reasonable wants shall
be anticipated, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shall be eminently qualified to discharge
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I
say Providence?--to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My heart was filled so full, both by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) said and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
affecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I
tried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``makes no condition beyond expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
expectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself
from the establishment in question without his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) knowledge and
concurrence. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) will faithfully apply herself to the
acquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)
will be ultimately dependent. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) will tread in the paths of
virtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I was still less able to speak than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what does our young friend say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Take
time, take time! I pause for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) reply. But take time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>What the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not
repeat. What she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth
the telling. What she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt, and will feel to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dying hour, I could
never relate.

<p/>This interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed -LRB-as far as I
knew-RRB- my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all
necessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.

<p/>Mrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was
not so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough
of a favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) sorry then. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) gave me one
cold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone
porch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and
self-reproachful that I clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) it was my fault, I
knew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) could say good-bye so easily!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``It is your misfortune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The coach</b></font>)</div><p/>The coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we
heard the wheels--and thus I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), with a sorrowful heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)
went in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the
door. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from the
window through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the
little property she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old
hearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first
thing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost
and snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)
own shawl and quietly laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)--I am half ashamed to tell it--in the
garden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window. I had no
companion left but my bird, and him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) I carried with me in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cage.

<p/>When the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the
straw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high
window, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of
spar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night's snow, and
the sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like
metal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away. There
was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked
very large in a quantity of wrappings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat gazing out of the
other window and took no notice of me.

<p/>I thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), of
her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) frowning so fixedly and sternly in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) bed, of the strange place
I was going to, of the people I should find there, and what they
would be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in the
coach gave me a terrible start.

<p/>It said, <div class="bookquote">``What the de-vil are you crying for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a
whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Me, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>For of course I knew it must have been the
gentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was still looking
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, turning round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know I was crying, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came quite
opposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
large furry cuffs across my eyes -LRB-but without hurting me-RRB-, and showed
me that it was wet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! Now you know you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you crying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to
go there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where? Why, wherever you are going,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to go there, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then! Look glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.

<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very strange, or at least that what I could see of
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very strange, for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was wrapped up to the chin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face
was almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head fastened under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chin; but I was composed again, and not
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). So I told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that I thought I must have been crying
because of my godmother's death and because of Mrs. Rachael's not
being sorry to part with me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound Mrs. Rachael!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) fly away in a
high wind on a broomstick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I began to be really afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) now and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with the
greatest astonishment. But I thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had pleasant eyes,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and
calling Mrs. Rachael names.

<p/>After a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) outer wrapper, which appeared to
me large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) arm down into
a deep pocket in the side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``In this paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which was nicely folded,
<div class="bookquote">``is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on
the outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here's a little
pie -LRB-a gem this is, both for size and quality-RRB-, made in France. And
what do you suppose it's made of? Livers of fat geese. There's a pie!
Now let's see you eat 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; <div class="bookquote">``thank you very much indeed, but I hope
you won't be offended--they are too rich for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Floored again!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, which I didn't at all
understand, and threw them both out of window.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not speak to me any more until he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got out of the coach a
little way short of Reading, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) advised me to be a good girl and
to be studious, and shook hands with me. I must say I was relieved by
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) departure. We left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at a milestone. I often walked past it
afterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and
half expecting to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). But I never did; and so, as time went on,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) passed out of my mind.

<p/>When the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Donny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, Esther Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady Donny</b></font>)</div>said the lady, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Donny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady Donny</b></font>)</div><p/>I now understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) introduced herself by that name, and begged
Miss Donny's pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her (<font color='blue'><b>Donny</b></font>)
request. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put
outside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid,
and I got inside and were driven away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is ready for you, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Donny</b></font>)</div>said Miss Donny, <div class="bookquote">``and the
scheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with
the wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Donny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of--did you say, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Donny</b></font>)</div>said Miss Donny.

<p/>I was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too
severe for me and lent me her (<font color='blue'><b>Donny</b></font>) smelling-bottle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked after a good
deal of hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not personally, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Donny</b></font>)</div>said Miss Donny; <div class="bookquote">``merely through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
solicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior
gentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) periods
quite majestic!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Donny</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it. Our
speedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover
myself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the
uncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf -LRB-Miss Donny's
house-RRB- that afternoon!

<p/>But I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of
Greenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while
and almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my
godmother's. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than
Greenleaf. There was a time for everything all round the dial of the
clock, and everything was done at its appointed moment.

<p/>We were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It
was understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my
qualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in
everything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in
helping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other
respect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made
in my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more,
and so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of
doing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a
new pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was so
sure--indeed I don't know why--to make a friend of me that all
new-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I
am sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my
birthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to
do some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed,
indeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so
much.

<p/>I passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face
there, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better
if I had never been born. When the day came round, it brought me so
many tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful
with them from New Year's Day to Christmas.

<p/>In those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday
time in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had
taken Miss Donny's advice in reference to the propriety of writing to
Mr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Donny</b></font>) approval
I had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer
acknowledging its receipt and saying, <div class="bookquote">``We note the contents thereof,
which shall be duly communicated to our client.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>After that I
sometimes heard Miss Donny and her (<font color='blue'><b>Donny</b></font>) sister mention how regular my
accounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a
similar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same
answer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy
in another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge's.

<p/>It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about
myself! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my
little body will soon fall into the background now.

<p/>Six quiet years -LRB-I find I am saying it for the second time-RRB- I had
passed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a
looking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when,
one November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.


<p/>Old Square, Lincoln's Inn

<p/>Madam,

<p/>Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) house,

directs us to inform you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) will be glad of your
serces in the afsd capacity.

<p/>We have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr
eight o'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next,
to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of
our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as
above.

<p/>We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,

<p/>Kenge and Carboy

<p/>Miss Esther Summerson


<p/>Oh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused
in the house! It was so tender in them to care so much for me, it was
so gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my
orphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful
natures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would
have had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it,
and the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble
regret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking
while it was full of rapture.

<p/>The letter gave me only five days' notice of my removal. When every
minute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in
those five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took
me through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time, and
when some cried, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my
bedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and when others
asked me only to write their names, <div class="bookquote">``With Esther's love,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and when
they all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me
weeping and cried, <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do when dear, dear Esther's gone!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had
all been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one, what a
heart I had!

<p/>And when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the
least among them, and when the maids said, <div class="bookquote">``Bless you, miss, wherever
you go!''  (<font color='red'><b>the maids</b></font>)</div>and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had
hardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to
give me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the
light of his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had
then!

<p/>And could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little
school, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving
their hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady
whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited
-LRB-who were said to be the proudest people in all that country-RRB-, caring
for nothing but calling out, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Esther. May you be very
happy!'' (<font color='red'><b>the people Good-bye</b></font>)</div>--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by
myself and said <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coach</b></font>)</div>many times
over!

<p/>But of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I
was going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course,
I made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying
very often, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
cheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was
longer about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my
eyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London.

<p/>I was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off,
and when we really were there, that we should never get there.
However, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and
particularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into
us, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began
to believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey.
Very soon afterwards we stopped.

<p/>A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from
the pavement and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am from Kenge and Carboy's, miss, of
Lincoln's Inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very obliging, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) handed me into a fly after
superintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) whether there was
a great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown
smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``This is a London particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had never heard of such a thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fog, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>We drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever
were seen in the world -LRB-I thought-RRB- and in such a distracting state of
confusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we
passed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through
a silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there
was an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance
to a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some
cloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.

<p/>This was Kenge and Carboy's. The young gentleman showed me through an
outer office into Mr. Kenge's room--there was no one in it--and
politely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) then called my
attention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side
of the chimney-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the
journey, as you're going before the Chancellor. Not that it's
requisite, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman civilly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going before the Chancellor?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, startled for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a matter of form, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>returned the young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Kenge is in court now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) compliments, and would you partake
of some refreshment'' (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a
small table--<div class="bookquote">``and look over the paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>which the young gentleman
gave me as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then stirred the fire and left me.

<p/>Everything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the
day-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and
cold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what
they meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly. As it
was of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep
at my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the
room, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables,
and at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most
inexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for
themselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and the
fire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on
flickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young
gentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours.

<p/>At last Mr. Kenge came. HE (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) was not altered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) was surprised to
see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. <div class="bookquote">``As you are going
to be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor's
private room, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we thought it well that you
should be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Lord
Chancellor, I dare say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>really not seeing on
consideration why I should be.

<p/>So Mr. Kenge gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) arm and we went round the corner, under a
colonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage,
into a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young
gentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was
interposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen,
talking.

<p/>They both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with
the fire shining upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), such a beautiful girl! With such rich
golden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,
trusting face!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Ada,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, <div class="bookquote">``this is Miss Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand extended,
but seemed to change her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind in a moment and kissed me. In short,
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few
minutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the
fire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.

<p/>What a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could
confide in me and like me! It was so good of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and so encouraging
to me!

<p/>The young gentleman was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) distant cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) name
Richard Carstone. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and
a most engaging laugh; and after she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had called him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) up to where we
sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a
light-hearted boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was very young, not more than nineteen then, if
quite so much, but nearly two years older than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was. They were
both orphans and -LRB-what was very unexpected and curious to me-RRB- had
never met before that day. Our all three coming together for the
first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we
talked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its
red eyes at us--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.

<p/>We conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag
wig frequently came in and out, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did so, we could hear a
drawling sound in the distance, which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said was one of the counsel
in our case addressing the Lord Chancellor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) told Mr. Kenge that
the Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently we heard a
bustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had
risen and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) lordship was in the next room.

<p/>The gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and
requested Mr. Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next
room, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now
that I can't help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and
sitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) lordship,
whose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another
chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) gave us a searching look as we entered, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) manner was
both courtly and kind.

<p/>The gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lordship's
table, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lordship silently selected one and turned over the
leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Chancellor</b></font>)</div>said the Lord Chancellor. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Ada Clare?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Kenge presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) lordship begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) to sit down near
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>). That he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) and was interested by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) even I could see
in a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young
creature should be represented by that dry, official place. The Lord
High Chancellor, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) best, appeared so poor a substitute for the
love and pride of parents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Jarndyce in question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said the Lord Chancellor, still turning
over leaves, <div class="bookquote">``is Jarndyce of Bleak House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Lord Chancellor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A dreary name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Chancellor</b></font>)</div>said the Lord Chancellor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But not a dreary place at present, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Bleak House,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) lordship, <div class="bookquote">``is in--''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hertfordshire, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) lordship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is not, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge.

<p/>A pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said the Lord Chancellor,
glancing towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>).

<p/>Richard bowed and stepped forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>Mr. Kenge observed in a low
voice, <div class="bookquote">``if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a suitable
companion for--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For Mr. Richard Carstone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>I thought -LRB-but I am not quite sure-RRB- I
heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy
very graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
lordship, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) eyes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) papers, listened, nodded twice or
thrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again
until we were going away.

<p/>Mr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), to where I was, near the
door, leaving my pet -LRB-it is so natural to me that again I can't help
it!-RRB- sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship spoke a
little part, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) told me afterwards, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had
well reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
would be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thought so? Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) rose courteously and released her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone, not seated,
but standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) still knew, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to
the candour of a boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I shall make the order. Mr.
Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and this
was when he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) looked at me, <div class="bookquote">``a very good companion for the young lady,
and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the
circumstances admit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to
him (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) for being so affable and polite, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) had certainly lost
no dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.

<p/>When we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) must go
back for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the
Lord Chancellor's carriage and servants waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to come out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard Carstone. <div class="bookquote">``THAT'S over! And where do we go next,
Miss Summerson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't YOU know, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>We looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the
children in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed
bonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us
with an air of great ceremony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to
have the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty
when they find themselves in this place, and don't know what's to
come of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>whispered Richard, not thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right! Mad, young gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned so quickly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was
quite abashed. <div class="bookquote">``I was a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>curtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. <div class="bookquote">``I had youth
and hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of
the three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court
regularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the
Day of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in
the Revelations is the Great Seal. It has been open a long time! Pray
accept my blessing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>As Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady,
that we were much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said mincingly. <div class="bookquote">``I imagine so. And here is Conversation
Kenge. With HIS (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) documents! How does your honourable worship do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite well, quite well! Now don't be troublesome, that's a good
soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.
<div class="bookquote">``Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is
not being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the
Day of Judgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but
we looked back as we went up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was still there, saying, still
with a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, <div class="bookquote">``Youth. And
hope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray
accept my blessing!''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>Telescopic Philanthropy


<p/>We were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
room, at Mrs. Jellyby's; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) turned to me and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) took it
for granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really don't, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss
Clare--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>But no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. <div class="bookquote">``In-deed! Mrs.
Jellyby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) back to the fire and
casting his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs.
Jellyby's biography, <div class="bookquote">``is a lady of very remarkable strength of
character who devotes herself entirely to the public. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) has devoted
herself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times
and is at present -LRB-until something else attracts her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)-RRB- devoted to the
subject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the
coffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks
of the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr.
Jarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely
to be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists,
has, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Kenge, adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) cravat, then looked at us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Jellyby, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>suggested Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mr. Jellyby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, <div class="bookquote">``is--a--I don't know that I can
describe him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) to you better than by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) is the husband of
Mrs. Jellyby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A nonentity, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard with a droll look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Kenge gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I can't say that,
indeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my
knowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) may be a very
superior man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more
shining qualities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that
as the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and
tedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling already,
Mr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement. A carriage would
be at Mrs. Jellyby's to convey us out of town early in the forenoon
of to-morrow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.
Addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss
Summerson's boxes and the rest of the baggage had been <div class="bookquote">``sent round.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Miss Summerson/Esther Summerson</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting
to take us round too as soon as we pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it only remains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, <div class="bookquote">``for
me to express my lively satisfaction in -LRB-good day, Miss Clare!-RRB- the
arrangement this day concluded and my -LRB-GOOD-bye to you, Miss
Summerson!-RRB- lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the
-LRB-glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr.
Carstone!-RRB- welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all
concerned! Guppy, see the party safely there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/>``Where IS ``there,<div class="bookquote">'' Mr. Guppy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard as we went downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy; <div class="bookquote">``round in Thavies Inn, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am
strange in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only round the corner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``We just twist up Chancery
Lane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four minutes' time,
as near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain't
it, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) seemed quite delighted with it on my account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fog is very dense indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that it affects you, though, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, putting
up the steps. <div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss,
judging from your appearance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at
myself for blushing at it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) had shut the door and got upon the
box; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and
the strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our
destination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to
hold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people,
principally children, gathered about the house at which we stopped,
which had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription
JELLYBY.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be frightened!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the
coach-window. <div class="bookquote">``One of the young Jellybys been and got his (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) head
through the area railings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor child,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``let me out, if you please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young Jellybys are always up
to something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy.

<p/>I made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little
unfortunates I ever saw, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) very hot and frightened and
crying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a
milkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were
endeavouring to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>) back by the legs, under a general impression
that his (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>) skull was compressible by those means. As I found -LRB-after
pacifying him (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>)-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>) was a little boy with a naturally large head,
I thought that perhaps where his (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>) head could go, his (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>) body could
follow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to
push him (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>) forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and
beadle that he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) would immediately have been pushed into the area if I
had not held his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down
through the kitchen to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) should be released. At last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) was happily got down without any accident, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) began to
beat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.

<p/>Nobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in
pattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I
don't know with what object, and I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did. I therefore
supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised
when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens, and
going up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me,
announced us as, <div class="bookquote">``Them two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>We passed
several more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid
treading on in the dark; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby's presence,
one of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight
-LRB-as it sounded to me-RRB-, with a great noise.

<p/>Mrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we
could not help showing in our own faces as the dear child's head
recorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with
perfect equanimity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of
from forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious
habit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard
again--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, <div class="bookquote">``to
have the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.
Jarndyce, and no one in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is interested can be an object of
indifference to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>We expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where
there was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair
but was too much occupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) African duties to brush it. The
shawl in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had been loosely muffled dropped onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) chair
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) advanced to us; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) turned to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) seat, we
could not help noticing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) dress didn't nearly meet up the back
and that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of
stay-lace--like a summer-house.

<p/>The room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great
writing-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only
very untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that
with our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we
followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the
back kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/>But what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking
though by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting
the feather of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was
in such a state of ink. And from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tumbled hair to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pretty feet,
which were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden
down at heel, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really seemed to have no article of dress upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
from a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right
place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You find me, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great
office candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste
strongly of hot tallow -LRB-the fire had gone out, and there was nothing
in the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``you find me,
my dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African
project at present employs my whole time. It involves me in
correspondence with public bodies and with private individuals
anxious for the welfare of their species all over the country. I am
happy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have
from a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating
coffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank
of the Niger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>As Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very
gratifying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS gratifying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby. <div class="bookquote">``It involves the devotion of
all my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that it
succeeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know,
Miss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts
to Africa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>This application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I
was quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The finest climate in the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. With precaution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby. <div class="bookquote">``You may go into
Holborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into
Holborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with
Africa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, <div class="bookquote">``No doubt.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I meant as to Holborn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers
towards us, <div class="bookquote">``to look over some remarks on that head, and on the
general subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I
finish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my
amanuensis--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl at the table left off biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) pen and made a return to
our recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--I shall then have finished for the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mrs.
Jellyby with a sweet smile, <div class="bookquote">``though my work is never done. Where are
you, Caddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Presents her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`And begs,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, <div class="bookquote">''`to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>), in
reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) letter of inquiry on the African project--' No,
Peepy! Not on my account!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Peepy -LRB-so self-named-RRB- was the unfortunate child who had fallen
downstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting
himself, with a strip of plaster on his (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) forehead, to exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>)
wounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity
most--the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the
serene composure with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said everything, <div class="bookquote">``Go along, you
naughty Peepy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) fine eyes on Africa again.

<p/>However, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) at once proceeded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) dictation, and as I
interrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor
Peepy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) was going out and to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) up to nurse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) looked very
much astonished at it and at Ada's kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>), but soon fell fast
asleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>)
was quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in
detail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the
momentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all
other places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so
little about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Six o'clock!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby. <div class="bookquote">``And our dinner hour is nominally
-LRB-for we dine at all hours-RRB- five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss
Summerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps?
You will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad
child! Pray put him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) down, Miss Summerson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I begged permission to retain him (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>), truly saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) was not at
all troublesome, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) upstairs and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Swallow</b></font>) on my bed. Ada
and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. They
were excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window
was fastened up with a fork.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would like some hot water, wouldn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said Miss Jellyby,
looking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is not being troublesome,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said we.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's not the trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Jellyby; <div class="bookquote">``the question is,
if there IS any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>The evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell
that I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half
crying. We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Miss
Jellyby came back to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was sorry there was no hot water,
but they couldn't find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order.

<p/>We begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) not to mention it and made all the haste we could to
get down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up
to the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my
bed, and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of
noses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the
doors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my
lock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and
though the handle of Ada's went round and round with the greatest
smoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door.
Therefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be
very good at my table, and I would tell them the story of Little Red
Riding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and were as quiet as
mice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of
the wolf.

<p/>When we went downstairs we found a mug with <div class="bookquote">``A Present from Tunbridge
Wells''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick,
and a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage
blowing the fire of the drawing-room -LRB-now connected by an open door
with Mrs. Jellyby's room-RRB- and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that
degree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the
windows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the
same sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) being so
employed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told us
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hands in a pie-dish and that they had found
the kettle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) dressing-table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) made Ada laugh so that they
made me laugh in the most ridiculous manner.

<p/>Soon after seven o'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs.
Jellyby's advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient
in stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. We had a fine
cod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an
excellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was
almost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and
dropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never
moved it again until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put it on the stairs. The person I had seen
in pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and
skirmished with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the door, and there appeared to be ill will
between them.

<p/>All through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents
as the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the
handle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in
the chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) disposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
told us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and
the natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters
were proceedings of ladies' committees or resolutions of ladies'
meetings, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) read to us; others were applications from people
excited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives;
others required answers, and these she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) eldest daughter from
the table three or four times to write. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was full of business and
undoubtedly was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had told us, devoted to the cause.

<p/>I was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in
spectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair -LRB-there was no top or
bottom in particular-RRB- after the fish was taken away and seemed
passively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively
interested in that settlement. As he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never spoke a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might
have been a native but for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) complexion. It was not until we left
the table and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remained alone with Richard that the possibility of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) WAS Mr. Jellyby;
and a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs
for temples and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) hair all brushed to the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) head, who
came in the evening, and told Ada he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) was a philanthropist, also
informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby
with Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.

<p/>This young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself about
Africa and a project of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) for teaching the coffee colonists to
teach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export
trade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying, <div class="bookquote">``I believe
now, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and
fifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have
you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>or, <div class="bookquote">``If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you
once mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one
post-office at one time?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby's answer to
us like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in
a corner with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head against the wall as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) were subject to low
spirits. It seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had several times opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mouth when
alone with Richard after dinner, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had something on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind,
but had always shut it again, to Richard's extreme confusion, without
saying anything.

<p/>Mrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee
all the evening and dictated at intervals to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) eldest daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
also held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to
be--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave
utterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an
auditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the
other children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the
drawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among them and
told them in whispers <div class="bookquote">``Puss in Boots''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and I don't know what else
until Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, sent them to bed.
As Peepy cried for me to take him (<font color='blue'><b>auditor</b></font>) to bed, I carried him (<font color='blue'><b>auditor</b></font>) upstairs,
where the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst
of the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs.

<p/>After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in
coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at
last it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that
Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I
was sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher
pretensions.

<p/>It was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to
bed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) papers drinking
coffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) pen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a strange house!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada when we got upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``How curious
of my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``it quite confuses me. I want to understand it,
and I can't understand it at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>asked Ada with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) pretty smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All this, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to
take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and
yet--Peepy and the housekeeping!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada laughed and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) arm about my neck as I stood looking at the
fire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
heart. <div class="bookquote">``You are so thoughtful, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and yet so
cheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a
home out of even this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>My simple darling! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was quite unconscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) only praised
herself and that it was in the goodness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) own heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
made so much of me!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask you a question?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I when we had sat before the fire a
little while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). Would you mind
describing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) golden hair, Ada turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) eyes upon me with such
laughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) beauty,
partly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>returned Ada.

<p/>Well, to be sure!

<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Young as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was when her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) mama died, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
remembered how the tears would come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) eyes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) spoke of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) and of the noble generosity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) character, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had said
was to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
cousin Jarndyce had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) a few months ago--<div class="bookquote">``a plain, honest
letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jarndyce/Fitz Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on
and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) that <div class="bookquote">``in time it might heal some of the wounds made
by the miserable Chancery suit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had replied, gratefully
accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had
made a similar response. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only
once, five years ago, at Winchester school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had told Ada, when
they were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) recollected him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``a bluff, rosy fellow.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This was the
utmost description Ada could give me.

<p/>It set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained
before the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and
wondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long
ago. I don't know where my thoughts had wandered when they were
recalled by a tap at the door.

<p/>I opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a
broken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in
the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said very sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same
sulky way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Don't wake Miss Clare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) inky middle
finger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing it over
the ink stains on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) face, frowning the whole time and looking very
gloomy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Africa was dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said on a sudden.

<p/>I was going to remonstrate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Don't talk to me, Miss Summerson. I hate it and
detest it. It's a beast!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was tired, and I was sorry. I put my hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
head, and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) forehead, and said it was hot now but would be
cool to-morrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) still stood pouting and frowning at me, but
presently put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed
where Ada lay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) is very pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said with the same knitted brow and in the
same uncivil manner.

<p/>I assented with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An orphan. Ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and
sing? She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,
and needlework, and everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``I can't do anything hardly, except write.
I'm always writing for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of
yourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing
else. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very
fine, I dare say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my
chair without speaking and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) -LRB-I hope-RRB- as mildly as I felt
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's disgraceful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. ``You know it is. The whole house is
disgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I<div class="bookquote">``M disgraceful. Pa's
miserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>)'s always drinking.
It's a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn't
smell her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner;
you know it was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, I don't know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said very shortly. <div class="bookquote">``You shan't say you don't. You do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``If you won't let me speak--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're speaking now. You know you are. Don't tell stories, Miss
Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``as long as you won't hear me out--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear you out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I think you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``because that would be so very
unreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did
not come near me at dinner; but I don't doubt what you tell me, and I
am sorry to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't make a merit of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``That would be very foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down -LRB-but still
with the same discontented face-RRB- and kissed Ada. That done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) came
softly back and stood by the side of my chair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bosom was heaving
in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it
better not to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) broke out. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we were all dead. It
would be a great deal better for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In a moment afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) knelt on the ground at my side, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
face in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I
comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and would have raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cried no, no; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
wanted to stay there!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to teach girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``If you could only have taught
me, I could have learnt from you! I am so very miserable, and I like
you so much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) to sit by me or to do anything but move a
ragged stool to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was kneeling, and take that, and still hold
my dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell
asleep, and then I contrived to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head so that it should rest
on my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and
all night long she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I
was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, with my eyes
closed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they
became indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the
sleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading
friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now
it was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now
some one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I
was no one.

<p/>The purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my
eyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon
me. Peepy had scaled his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) crib, and crept down in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bed-gown and
cap, and was so cold that his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) teeth were chattering as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had cut
them all.




<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>A Morning Adventure


<p/>Although the morning was raw, and although the fog still seemed
heavy--I say seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that
they would have made midsummer sunshine dim--I was sufficiently
forewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and
sufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part
of Miss Jellyby when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) proposed that we should go out for a walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ma won't be down for ever so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and then it's a
chance if breakfast's ready for an hour afterwards, they dawdle so.
As to Pa, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) gets what he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) can and goes to the office. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) never has
what you would call a regular breakfast. Priscilla leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) out the
loaf and some milk, when there is any, overnight. Sometimes there
isn't any milk, and sometimes the cat drinks it. But I'm afraid you
must be tired, Miss Summerson, and perhaps you would rather go to
bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all tired, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and would much prefer to
go out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're sure you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Jellyby, <div class="bookquote">``I'll get my
things on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) would go too, and was soon astir. I made a proposal to
Peepy, in default of being able to do anything better for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), that
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should let me wash him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and afterwards lay him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) down on my bed
again. To this he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) submitted with the best grace possible, staring at
me during the whole operation as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never had been, and never
could again be, so astonished in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) life--looking very miserable
also, certainly, but making no complaint, and going snugly to sleep
as soon as it was over. At first I was in two minds about taking such
a liberty, but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely
to notice it.

<p/>What with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting
myself ready and helping Ada, I was soon quite in a glow. We found
Miss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room,
which Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick,
throwing the candle in to make it burn better. Everything was just as
we had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so.
Below-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away, but had been
left ready for breakfast. Crumbs, dust, and waste-paper were all over
the house. Some pewter pots and a milk-can hung on the area railings;
the door stood open; and we met the cook round the corner coming out
of a public-house, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) mentioned, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) passed us,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) had been to see what o'clock it was.

<p/>But before we met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing up and
down Thavies Inn to warm his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was agreeably surprised to see
us stirring so soon and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would gladly share our walk. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
took care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention
that Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) sulky manner and that I
really should not have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) liked me much unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had told
me so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where would you wish to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere's nowhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go somewhere at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) then walked me on very fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Now, you are my witness, Miss Summerson, I
say I don't care--but if he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was to come to our house with his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) great,
shining, lumpy forehead night after night till he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was as old as
Methuselah, I wouldn't have anything to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>). Such ASSES as he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
and Ma make of themselves!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the
vigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it. <div class="bookquote">``Your duty as a child--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Don't talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson; where's Ma's duty
as a parent? All made over to the public and Africa, I suppose! Then
let the public and Africa show duty as a child; it's much more their
affair than mine. You are shocked, I dare say! Very well, so am I
shocked too; so we are both shocked, and there's an end of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) walked me on faster yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But for all that, I say again, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may come, and come, and come, and
I won't have anything to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I can't bear him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). If there's any
stuff in the world that I hate and detest, it's the stuff he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and Ma
talk. I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our house can have the
patience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and
contradictions as all that sounding nonsense, and Ma's management!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not but understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) to refer to Mr. Quale, the young
gentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday. I was saved the
disagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada
coming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to run
a race. Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and walked
moodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and
varieties of streets, the quantity of people already going to and
fro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy
preparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping
out of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly
groping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.
<div class="bookquote">``We are never to get out of Chancery! We have come by another way to
our place of meeting yesterday, and--by the Great Seal, here's the
old lady again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Truly, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was, immediately in front of us, curtsying, and
smiling, and saying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) yesterday's air of patronage, <div class="bookquote">``The wards
in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are out early, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) curtsied to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es! I usually walk here early. Before the court sits. It's
retired. I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady mincingly. <div class="bookquote">``The business of the day requires a
great deal of thought. Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to
follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's this, Miss Summerson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm
tighter through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) own.

<p/>The little old lady's hearing was remarkably quick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) answered for
herself directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A suitor, my child. At your service. I have the honour to attend
court regularly. With my documents. Have I the pleasure of addressing
another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady,
recovering herself, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head on one side, from a very low
curtsy.

<p/>Richard, anxious to atone for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) thoughtlessness of yesterday,
good-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the
suit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) does not expect a judgment? She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) will
still grow old. But not so old. Oh, dear, no! This is the garden of
Lincoln's Inn. I call it my garden. It is quite a bower in the
summer-time. Where the birds sing melodiously. I pass the greater
part of the long vacation here. In contemplation. You find the long
vacation exceedingly long, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>We said yes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to expect us to say so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more
flowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor's
court,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, <div class="bookquote">``the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth
seal, mentioned in the Revelations, again prevails. Pray come and see
my lodging. It will be a good omen for me. Youth, and hope, and
beauty are very seldom there. It is a long, long time since I had a
visit from either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had taken my hand, and leading me and Miss Jellyby away, beckoned
Richard and Ada to come too. I did not know how to excuse myself and
looked to Richard for aid. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was half amused and half curious and
all in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
continued to lead us away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and Ada continued to follow, our
strange conductress informing us all the time, with much smiling
condescension, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lived close by.

<p/>It was quite true, as it soon appeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lived so close by that we
had not time to have done humouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) for a few moments before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
was at home. Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old lady
stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of some
courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``This is my lodging. Pray walk up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK, RAG AND
BOTTLE WAREHOUSE. Also, in long thin letters, KROOK, DEALER IN MARINE
STORES. In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill
at which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags. In
another was the inscription BONES BOUGHT. In another, KITCHEN-STUFF
BOUGHT. In another, OLD IRON BOUGHT. In another, WASTE-PAPER BOUGHT.
In another, LADIES' AND GENTLEMEN``S WARDROBES BOUGHT. Everything
seemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there. In all parts of the
window were quantities of dirty bottles--blacking bottles, medicine
bottles, ginger-beer and soda-water bottles, pickle bottles, wine
bottles, ink bottles; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the
shop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal
neighbourhood and of being, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and
disowned relation of the law. There were a great many ink bottles.
There was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the
door, labelled <div class="bookquote">``Law Books, all at 9d.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Some of the inscriptions I
have enumerated were written in law-hand, like the papers I had seen
in Kenge and Carboy's office and the letters I had so long received
from the firm. Among them was one, in the same writing, having
nothing to do with the business of the shop, but announcing that a
respectable man aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to
execute with neatness and dispatch: Address to Nemo, care of Mr.
Krook, within. There were several second-hand bags, blue and red,
hanging up. A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old
crackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog's-eared
law-papers. I could have fancied that all the rusty keys, of which
there must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron, had once
belonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers' offices. The
litter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged
wooden scale, hanging without any counterpoise from a beam, might
have been counsellors' bands and gowns torn up. One had only to
fancy, as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking
in, that yonder bones in a corner, piled together and picked very
clean, were the bones of clients, to make the picture complete.

<p/>As it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides
by the wall of Lincoln's Inn, intercepting the light within a couple
of yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern
that an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in
the shop. Turning towards the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now caught sight of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
short, cadaverous, and withered, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head sunk sideways between
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were on fire within. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat, chin, and eyebrows were so
frosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast upward like some old root in a fall of
snow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi, hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, coming to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Have you anything to
sell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>We naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been
trying to open the house-door with a key she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure
of seeing where she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived, we would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), being pressed for
time. But she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not to be so easily left. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became so
fantastically and pressingly earnest in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entreaties that we would
walk up and see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apartment for an instant, and was so bent, in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
harmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good omen she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired,
that I -LRB-whatever the others might do-RRB- saw nothing for it but to
comply. I suppose we were all more or less curious; at any rate, when
the old man added his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) persuasions to hers and said, <div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye! Please
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)! It won't take a minute! Come in, come in! Come in through the
shop if t`other door's out of order!''  (<font color='red'><b>persuasions</b></font>)</div>we all went in, stimulated by
Richard's laughing encouragement and relying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) protection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My landlord, Krook,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the little old lady, condescending to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lofty station as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to us. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is called
among the neighbours the Lord Chancellor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) shop is called the
Court of Chancery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is a very eccentric person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is very odd. Oh,
I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is very odd!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head a great many times and tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``For he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is a little--you know--M!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the old lady with great
stateliness. The old man overheard, and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, going before us with the lantern, <div class="bookquote">``that
they call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery. And why
do you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, I am sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard rather carelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, stopping and turning round, <div class="bookquote">``they--Hi!
Here's lovely hair! I have got three sacks of ladies' hair below, but
none so beautiful and fine as this. What colour, and what texture!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll do, my good friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, strongly disapproving of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) having drawn one of Ada's tresses through his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) yellow hand. <div class="bookquote">``You
can admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man darted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) a sudden look which even called my
attention from Ada, who, startled and blushing, was so remarkably
beautiful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) seemed to fix the wandering attention of the
little old lady herself. But as Ada interposed and laughingly said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) could only feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook
shrunk into his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) former self as suddenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) had leaped out of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I have so many things here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) resumed, holding up the
lantern, <div class="bookquote">``of so many kinds, and all as the neighbours think -LRB-but THEY
know nothing-RRB-, wasting away and going to rack and ruin, that that's
why they have given me and my place a christening. And I have so many
old parchmentses and papers in my stock. And I have a liking for rust
and must and cobwebs. And all's fish that comes to my net. And I
can't abear to part with anything I once lay hold of -LRB-or so my
neighbours think, but what do THEY know?-RRB- or to alter anything, or to
have any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor repairing going on
about me. That's the way I've got the ill name of Chancery. I don't
mind. I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sits in the Inn. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) don't notice me, but I notice him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
There's no great odds betwixt us. We both grub on in a muddle. Hi,
Lady Jane!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) shoulder
and startled us all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi! Show 'em how you scratch. Hi! Tear, my lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) master.

<p/>The cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) tigerish
claws, with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d do as much for any one I was to set her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man.
<div class="bookquote">``I deal in cat-skins among other general matters, and hers was
offered to me. It's a very fine skin, as you may see, but I didn't
have it stripped off! THAT warn't like Chancery practice though, says
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door in
the back part of it, leading to the house-entry. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously observed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
before passing out, <div class="bookquote">``That will do, Krook. You mean well, but are
tiresome. My young friends are pressed for time. I have none to spare
myself, having to attend court very soon. My young friends are the
wards in Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jarndyce!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man with a start.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The great suit, Krook,''  (<font color='red'><b>lodger</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and
with a wider stare than before. <div class="bookquote">``Think of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that
Richard said, <div class="bookquote">``Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about
the causes before your noble and learned brother, the other
Chancellor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man abstractedly. <div class="bookquote">``Sure! YOUR name now will be--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard Carstone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forefinger; and each of the others he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on to mention upon a
separate finger. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. There was the name of Barbary, and the name of
Clare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said
Richard, quite astonished, to Ada and me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, coming slowly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abstraction. <div class="bookquote">``Yes!
Tom Jarndyce--you'll excuse me, being related; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was never known
about court by any other name, and was as well known there as--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>lodger</b></font>)</div>nodding slightly at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodger. ``Tom Jarndyce was often in
here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause
was on, or expected, talking to the little shopkeepers and telling
'em to keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. ``For,<div class="bookquote">'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `it's
being ground to bits in a slow mill; it's being roasted at a slow
fire; it's being stung to death by single bees; it's being drowned by
drops; it's going mad by grains.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as near making away with
himself, just where the young lady stands, as near could be.''

<p/>We listened with horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) come in at the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, slowly pointing an
imaginary track along the shop, ``on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) did it--the whole
neighbourhood had said for months before that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would do it, of a
certainty sooner or later--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) come in at the door that day, and
walked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, and
asked me -LRB-you'll judge I was a mortal sight younger then-RRB- to fetch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) a pint of wine. ``For,'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ``Krook, I am much depressed; my
cause is on again, and I think I'm nearer judgment than I ever was.''
I hadn't a mind to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alone; and I persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go to the
tavern over the way there, t`other side my lane -LRB-I mean Chancery
Lane-RRB-; and I followed and looked in at the window, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
comfortable as I thought, in the arm-chair by the fire, and company
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I hadn't hardly got back here when I heard a shot go
echoing and rattling right away into the inn. I ran out--neighbours
ran out--twenty of us cried at once, <div class="bookquote">``Tom Jarndyce!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked down into the lantern,
blew the light out, and shut the lantern up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were right, I needn't tell the present hearers. Hi! To be sure,
how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the
cause was on! How my noble and learned brother, and all the rest of
'em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they
hadn't heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they
had--Oh, dear me!--nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of
it by any chance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada's colour had entirely left her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), and Richard was scarcely less
pale. Nor could I wonder, judging even from my emotions, and I was no
party in the suit, that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock
to come into the inheritance of a protracted misery, attended in the
minds of many people with such dreadful recollections. I had another
uneasiness, in the application of the painful story to the poor
half-witted creature who had brought us there; but, to my surprise,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way
upstairs again, informing us with the toleration of a superior
creature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) landlord was
<div class="bookquote">``a little M, you know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lived at the top of the house, in a pretty large room, from which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had a glimpse of Lincoln's Inn Hall. This seemed to have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
principal inducement, originally, for taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) residence there.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) could look at it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said, in the night, especially in the
moonshine. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) room was clean, but very, very bare. I noticed the
scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture; a few old prints from
books, of Chancellors and barristers, wafered against the wall; and
some half-dozen reticles and work-bags, <div class="bookquote">``containing documents,''  (<font color='red'><b>barristers</b></font>)</div>as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) informed us. There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate, and
I saw no articles of clothing anywhere, nor any kind of food. Upon a
shelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so
forth, but all dry and empty. There was a more affecting meaning in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) pinched appearance, I thought as I looked round, than I had
understood before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Extremely honoured, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>said our poor hostess with the
greatest suavity, <div class="bookquote">``by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce. And very
much indebted for the omen. It is a retired situation. Considering. I
am limited as to situation. In consequence of the necessity of
attending on the Chancellor. I have lived here many years. I pass my
days in court, my evenings and my nights here. I find the nights
long, for I sleep but little and think much. That is, of course,
unavoidable, being in Chancery. I am sorry I cannot offer chocolate.
I expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on
a superior footing. At present, I don't mind confessing to the wards
in Jarndyce -LRB-in strict confidence-RRB- that I sometimes find it difficult
to keep up a genteel appearance. I have felt the cold here. I have
felt something sharper than cold. It matters very little. Pray excuse
the introduction of such mean topics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) partly drew aside the curtain of the long, low garret window and
called our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there, some
containing several birds. There were larks, linnets, and
goldfinches--I should think at least twenty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I began to keep the little creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with an object
that the wards will readily comprehend. With the intention of
restoring them to liberty. When my judgment should be given. Ye-es!
They die in prison, though. Their lives, poor silly things, are so
short in comparison with Chancery proceedings that, one by one, the
whole collection has died over and over again. I doubt, do you know,
whether one of these, though they are all young, will live to be
free! Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Although she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) sometimes asked a question, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) never seemed to expect a
reply, but rambled on as if she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) were in the habit of doing so when no
one but herself was present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I positively doubt sometimes, I do assure
you, whether while matters are still unsettled, and the sixth or
Great Seal still prevails, I may not one day be found lying stark and
senseless here, as I have found so many birds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard, answering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) saw in Ada's compassionate eyes, took the
opportunity of laying some money, softly and unobserved, on the
chimney-piece. We all drew nearer to the cages, feigning to examine
the birds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't allow them to sing much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the little old lady, <div class="bookquote">``for
-LRB-you'll think this curious-RRB- I find my mind confused by the idea that
they are singing while I am following the arguments in court. And my
mind requires to be so very clear, you know! Another time, I'll tell
you their names. Not at present. On a day of such good omen, they
shall sing as much as they like. In honour of youth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>a smile and
curtsy, <div class="bookquote">``hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a smile and curtsy, <div class="bookquote">``and beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a smile and curtsy.
<div class="bookquote">``There! We'll let in the full light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The birds began to stir and chirp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot admit the air freely,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the little old lady--the room
was close, and would have been the better for it--<div class="bookquote">``because the cat
you saw downstairs, called Lady Jane, is greedy for their lives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
crouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours. I have
discovered,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>whispering mysteriously, <div class="bookquote">``that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) natural cruelty is
sharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty. In
consequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is sly
and full of malice. I half believe, sometimes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is no cat,
but the wolf of the old saying. It is so very difficult to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
from the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Some neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was
half-past nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to
an end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hurriedly
took up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little bag of documents, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had laid upon the
table on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court. On
our answering no, and that we would on no account detain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
opened the door to attend us downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With such an omen, it is even more necessary than usual that I
should be there before the Chancellor comes in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
might mention my case the first thing. I have a presentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
WILL mention it the first thing this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the
whole house was filled with strange lumber which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) landlord had
bought piecemeal and had no wish to sell, in consequence of being a
little M. This was on the first floor. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had made a previous
stoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only other lodger,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now whispered in explanation, <div class="bookquote">``a
law-writer. The children in the lanes here say he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) has sold himself to
the devil. I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) can have done with the money. Hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) even there,
and repeating <div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lodger</b></font>)</div>went before us on tiptoe as though even the
sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) footsteps might reveal to him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had said.

<p/>Passing through the shop on our way out, as we had passed through it
on our way in, we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of
waste-paper in a kind of well in the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be working
hard, with the perspiration standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, and had a piece
of chalk by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put each separate package or
bundle down, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall.

<p/>Richard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the little old lady had gone
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), and I was going when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) touched me on the arm to stay me, and
chalked the letter J upon the wall--in a very curious manner,
beginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward. It was
a capital letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as any
clerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy's office would have made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you read it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) asked me with a keen glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It's very plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``J.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>With another glance at me, and a glance at the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) rubbed it out
and turned an <div class="bookquote">``a''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in its place -LRB-not a capital letter this time-RRB-, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) then rubbed that out and turned the letter <div class="bookquote">``r,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and
asked me the same question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) went on quickly until he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had formed in
the same curious manner, beginning at the ends and bottoms of the
letters, the word Jarndyce, without once leaving two letters on the
wall together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that spell?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) asked me.

<p/>When I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) laughed. In the same odd way, yet with the same
rapidity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) then produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the letters
forming the words Bleak House. These, in some astonishment, I also
read; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) laughed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, laying aside the chalk. <div class="bookquote">``I have a turn for
copying from memory, you see, miss, though I can neither read nor
write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked so disagreeable and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cat looked so wickedly at me, as if
I were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs, that I was quite
relieved by Richard's appearing at the door and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Summerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair.
Don't be tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>I lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my
friends outside, where we parted with the little old lady, who gave
us her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blessing with great ceremony and renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) assurance of
yesterday in reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intention of settling estates on Ada
and me. Before we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked back
and saw Mr. Krook standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) shop-door, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) spectacles,
looking after us, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) cat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) shoulder, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tail
sticking up on one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) hairy cap like a tall feather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite an adventure for a morning in London!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard with a
sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, cousin, cousin, it's a weary word this Chancery!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is to me, and has been ever since I can remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>returned Ada.
<div class="bookquote">``I am grieved that I should be the enemy--as I suppose I am--of a
great number of relations and others, and that they should be my
enemies--as I suppose they are--and that we should all be ruining one
another without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and
discord all our lives. It seems very strange, as there must be right
somewhere, that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to
find out through all these years where it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``Strange, indeed! All this wasteful,
wanton chess-playing IS very strange. To see that composed court
yesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of
the pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both
together. My head ached with wondering how it happened, if men were
neither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think they could
possibly be either. But at all events, Ada--I may call you Ada?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you may, cousin Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At all events, Chancery will work none of its bad influences on US.
We have happily been brought together, thanks to our good kinsman,
and it can't divide us now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, I hope, cousin Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada gently.

<p/>Miss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look. I
smiled in return, and we made the rest of the way back very
pleasantly.

<p/>In half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in the
course of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast
straggled one by one into the dining-room. I do not doubt that Mrs.
Jellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
presented no appearance of having changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was greatly
occupied during breakfast, for the morning's post brought a heavy
correspondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha, which would occasion her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said-RRB- to pass a busy day. The children tumbled about, and
notched memoranda of their accidents in their legs, which were
perfect little calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost for an hour
and a half, and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman. The
equable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) absence and
his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) restoration to the family circle surprised us all.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was
fast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>). At
one o'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart for our
luggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) good
friend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) desk to see us depart, kissed me
in the passage, and stood biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) pen and sobbing on the steps;
Peepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain of
separation -LRB-I was not without misgivings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had gone to Newgate
market in search of me-RRB-; and all the other children got up behind the
barouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great concern, scattered
over the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts.




<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>Quite at Home


<p/>The day had brightened very much, and still brightened as we went
westward. We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air,
wondering more and more at the extent of the streets, the brilliancy
of the shops, the great traffic, and the crowds of people whom the
pleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many-coloured
flowers. By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to
proceed through suburbs which, of themselves, would have made a
pretty large town in my eyes; and at last we got into a real country
road again, with windmills, rick-yards, milestones, farmers' waggons,
scents of old hay, swinging signs, and horse troughs: trees, fields,
and hedge-rows. It was delightful to see the green landscape before
us and the immense metropolis behind; and when a waggon with a train
of beautiful horses, furnished with red trappings and clear-sounding
bells, came by us with its music, I believe we could all three have
sung to the bells, so cheerful were the influences around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole road has been reminding me of my namesake Whittington,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``and that waggon is the finishing touch. Halloa! What's
the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>We had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too. Its music changed as
the horses came to a stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, except
when a horse tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head or shook himself and sprinkled off a
little shower of bell-ringing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our postilion is looking after the waggoner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``and the
waggoner is coming back after us. Good day, friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>The waggoner was
at our coach-door. <div class="bookquote">``Why, here's an extraordinary thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>added
Richard, looking closely at the man. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has got your name, Ada, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had all our names in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hat. Tucked within the band were three
small notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me. These
the waggoner delivered to each of us respectively, reading the name
aloud first. In answer to Richard's inquiry from whom they came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
briefly answered, <div class="bookquote">``Master, sir, if you please'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
hat again -LRB-which was like a soft bowl-RRB-, cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) whip, re-awakened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) music, and went melodiously away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that Mr. Jarndyce's waggon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, calling to our
post-boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Going to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We opened the notes. Each was a counterpart of the other and
contained these words in a solid, plain hand.


<p/>I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily and
without constraint on either side. I therefore have to
propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for
granted. It will be a relief to you possibly, and to me
certainly, and so my love to you.

<p/>John Jarndyce


<p/>I had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my
companions, having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one
who had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so
many years. I had not considered how I could thank him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>), my gratitude
lying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to consider how
I could meet him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) without thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>), and felt it would be very
difficult indeed.

<p/>The notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they
both had, without quite knowing how they came by it, that their
cousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
performed and that sooner than receive any he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would resort to the
most singular expedients and evasions or would even run away. Ada
dimly remembered to have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) mother tell, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was a very
little child, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had once done her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) an act of uncommon generosity
and that on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) house to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) happened to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) through a window coming to the door, and immediately escaped by
the back gate, and was not heard of for three months. This discourse
led to a great deal more on the same theme, and indeed it lasted us
all day, and we talked of scarcely anything else. If we did by any
chance diverge into another subject, we soon returned to this, and
wondered what the house would be like, and when we should get there,
and whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after
a delay, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would say to us, and what we should say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).
All of which we wondered about, over and over again.

<p/>The roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was
generally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and liked
it so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got
to the top. At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us, but as
they had only just been fed, we had to wait for them too, and got a
long fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the
carriage came up. These delays so protracted the journey that the
short day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came
to St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.

<p/>By that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard
confessed, as we rattled over the stones of the old street, to
feeling an irrational desire to drive back again. As to Ada and me,
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had wrapped up with great care, the night being sharp and
frosty, we trembled from head to foot. When we turned out of the
town, round a corner, and Richard told us that the post-boy, who had
for a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation, was
looking back and nodding, we both stood up in the carriage -LRB-Richard
holding Ada lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) should be jolted down-RRB- and gazed round upon the
open country and the starlight night for our destination. There was a
light sparkling on the top of a hill before us, and the driver,
pointing to it with his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip and crying, <div class="bookquote">``That's Bleak House!''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver House</b></font>)</div>put
his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate, uphill
though it was, that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our
heads like spray from a water-mill. Presently we lost the light,
presently saw it, presently lost it, presently saw it, and turned
into an avenue of trees and cantered up towards where it was beaming
brightly. It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned
house with three peaks in the roof in front and a circular sweep
leading to the porch. A bell was rung as we drew up, and amidst the
sound of its deep voice in the still air, and the distant barking of
some dogs, and a gush of light from the opened door, and the smoking
and steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened beating of our
own hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome. I rejoice to see
you! Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I would give it you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman who said these words in a clear, bright, hospitable
voice had one of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms round Ada's waist and the other round mine,
and kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore us across the hall
into a ruddy little room, all in a glow with a blazing fire. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
kissed us again, and opening his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms, made us sit down side by side
on a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth. I felt that if we had been
at all demonstrative, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have run away in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Rick!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is
as good as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.
Warm yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect
and frankness, and only saying -LRB-though with an earnestness that
rather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce's suddenly
disappearing-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, sir! We are very much obliged to
you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hat and coat and came up to the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did you like the ride? And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my
dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.

<p/>While Ada was speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) in reply, I glanced -LRB-I need not say
with how much interest-RRB- at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face. It was a handsome, lively, quick
face, full of change and motion; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hair was a silvered
iron-grey. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was
upright, hearty, and robust. From the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) first speaking to
us his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that
I could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
manner and a pleasant expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) eyes recalled the gentleman
in the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to
Reading. I was certain it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). I never was so frightened in my
life as when I made the discovery, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) caught my glance, and
appearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the door that I
thought we had lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).

<p/>However, I am happy to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) remained where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was, and asked me
what I thought of Mrs. Jellyby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``But you answer like Ada.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Whom I had
not heard. <div class="bookquote">``You all think something else, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We rather thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who
entreated me with their eyes to speak, <div class="bookquote">``that perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was a little
unmindful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Floored!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/>I was rather alarmed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I want to know your real thoughts, my dear. I may have sent
you there on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought that, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, hesitating, <div class="bookquote">``it is right to begin
with the obligations of home, sir; and that, perhaps, while those are
overlooked and neglected, no other duties can possibly be substituted
for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The little Jellybys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, coming to my relief, <div class="bookquote">``are
really--I can't help expressing myself strongly, sir--in a devil of a
state.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) means well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce hastily. <div class="bookquote">``The wind's in the
east.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was in the north, sir, as we came down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>observed Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Rick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, <div class="bookquote">``I'll take an
oath it's either in the east or going to be. I am always conscious of
an uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in
the east.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rheumatism, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And so the little Jell--I
had my doubts about 'em--are in a--oh, Lord, yes, it's easterly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering
these broken sentences, retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation at once so
whimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) than we could possibly have expressed in any words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) gave an
arm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard bring a candle, was
leading the way out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) suddenly turned us all back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those little Jellybys. Couldn't you--didn't you--now, if it had
rained sugar-plums, or three-cornered raspberry tarts, or anything of
that sort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, cousin--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>Ada hastily began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good, my pretty pet. I like cousin. Cousin John, perhaps, is
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, cousin John--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>Ada laughingly began again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha! Very good indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment.
<div class="bookquote">``Sounds uncommonly natural. Yes, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It did better than that. It rained Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``What did Esther do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, cousin John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) arm and
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head at me across him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)--for I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) to be
quiet--<div class="bookquote">``Esther was their friend directly. Esther nursed them, coaxed
them to sleep, washed and dressed them, told them stories, kept them
quiet, bought them keepsakes'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--My dear girl! I had only gone out with
Peepy after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was found and given him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) a little, tiny horse!--<div class="bookquote">``and,
cousin John, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so much and
was so thoughtful for me and so amiable! No, no, I won't be
contradicted, Esther dear! You know, you know, it's true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>The warm-hearted darling leaned across her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin John and kissed me,
and then looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face, boldly said, <div class="bookquote">``At all events, cousin
John, I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I felt
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) challenged him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to run away. But he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) didn't.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you say the wind was, Rick?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the north as we came down, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right. There's no east in it. A mistake of mine. Come,
girls, come and see your home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up and
down steps out of one room into another, and where you come upon more
rooms when you think you have seen all there are, and where there is
a bountiful provision of little halls and passages, and where you
find still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places with lattice
windows and green growth pressing through them. Mine, which we
entered first, was of this kind, with an up-and-down roof that had
more corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney
-LRB-there was a wood fire on the hearth-RRB- paved all around with pure
white tiles, in every one of which a bright miniature of the fire was
blazing. Out of this room, you went down two steps into a charming
little sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, which room was
henceforth to belong to Ada and me. Out of this you went up three
steps into Ada's bedroom, which had a fine broad window commanding a
beautiful view -LRB-we saw a great expanse of darkness lying underneath
the stars-RRB-, to which there was a hollow window-seat, in which, with a
spring-lock, three dear Adas might have been lost at once. Out of
this room you passed into a little gallery, with which the other best
rooms -LRB-only two-RRB- communicated, and so, by a little staircase of
shallow steps with a number of corner stairs in it, considering its
length, down into the hall. But if instead of going out at Ada's door
you came back into my room, and went out at the door by which you had
entered it, and turned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an
unexpected manner from the stairs, you lost yourself in passages,
with mangles in them, and three-cornered tables, and a native Hindu
chair, which was also a sofa, a box, and a bedstead, and looked in
every form something between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage,
and had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when. From
these you came on Richard's room, which was part library, part
sitting-room, part bedroom, and seemed indeed a comfortable compound
of many rooms. Out of that you went straight, with a little interval
of passage, to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the year
round, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) window open, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) bedstead without any furniture
standing in the middle of the floor for more air, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) cold bath
gaping for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) in a smaller room adjoining. Out of that you came into
another passage, where there were back-stairs and where you could
hear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told
to <div class="bookquote">``Hold up''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Get over,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as they slipped about very much on the
uneven stones. Or you might, if you came out at another door -LRB-every
room had at least two doors-RRB-, go straight down to the hall again by
half-a-dozen steps and a low archway, wondering how you got back
there or had ever got out of it.

<p/>The furniture, old-fashioned rather than old, like the house, was as
pleasantly irregular. Ada's sleeping-room was all flowers--in chintz
and paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two stiff
courtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of a stool
for greater state, on either side of the fire-place. Our sitting-room
was green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of
surprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures at a real
trout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been served with
gravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole process of
preparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists. In my room
there were oval engravings of the months--ladies haymaking in short
waists and large hats tied under the chin, for June; smooth-legged
noblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples, for October.
Half-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but
were so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of
mine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young
bride, with a flower in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) bodice, in the breakfast-room. As
substitutes, I had four angels, of Queen Anne's reign, taking a
complacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons, with some difficulty;
and a composition in needlework representing fruit, a kettle, and an
alphabet. All the movables, from the wardrobes to the chairs and
tables, hangings, glasses, even to the pincushions and scent-bottles
on the dressing-tables, displayed the same quaint variety. They
agreed in nothing but their perfect neatness, their display of the
whitest linen, and their storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a
drawer, small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities of
rose-leaves and sweet lavender. Such, with its illuminated windows,
softened here and there by shadows of curtains, shining out upon the
starlight night; with its light, and warmth, and comfort; with its
hospitable jingle, at a distance, of preparations for dinner; with
the face of its generous master brightening everything we saw; and
just wind enough without to sound a low accompaniment to everything
we heard, were our first impressions of Bleak House.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had brought us
round again to Ada's sitting-room. <div class="bookquote">``It makes no pretensions, but it
is a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be more so with such
bright young looks in it. You have barely half an hour before dinner.
There's no one here but the finest creature upon earth--a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More children, Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean literally a child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Jarndyce; <div class="bookquote">``not a child
in years. He (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is grown up--he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is at least as old as I am--but in
simplicity, and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine guileless
inaptitude for all worldly affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is a perfect child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>We felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) must be very interesting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) knows Mrs. Jellyby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is a musical man, an
amateur, but might have been a professional. He (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is an artist too, an
amateur, but might have been a professional. He (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is a man of
attainments and of captivating manners. He (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) has been unfortunate in
his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) affairs, and unfortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) pursuits, and unfortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>)
family; but he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) don't care--he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>)'s a child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) has children of his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) own, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>inquired
Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Rick! Half-a-dozen. More! Nearer a dozen, I should think. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) has never looked after them. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) wanted somebody to
look after HIM. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) is a child, you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>inquired
Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, just as you may suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) countenance
suddenly falling. <div class="bookquote">``It is said that the children of the very poor are
not brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole's children have
tumbled up somehow or other. The wind's getting round again, I am
afraid. I feel it rather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS exposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``No doubt that's the cause. Bleak
House has an exposed sound. But you are coming my way. Come along!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Our luggage having arrived and being all at hand, I was dressed in a
few minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a maid
-LRB-not the one in attendance upon Ada, but another, whom I had not
seen-RRB- brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in it,
all labelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For you, miss, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The housekeeping keys, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I showed my surprise, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) added with some little surprise on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
own part, <div class="bookquote">``I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone, miss.
Miss Summerson, if I don't deceive myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``That is my name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the little bunch is the
cellars, miss. Any time you was pleased to appoint to-morrow morning,
I was to show you the presses and things they belong to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I would be ready at half-past six, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was gone,
stood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my trust.
Ada found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I
showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) the keys and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) about them that it would have been
insensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged. I knew, to be
sure, that it was the dear girl's kindness, but I liked to be so
pleasantly cheated.

<p/>When we went downstairs, we were presented to Mr. Skimpole, who was
standing before the fire telling Richard how fond he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) used to be, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) school-time, of football. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was a little bright creature with a
rather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, and there
was a perfect charm in him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). All he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said was so free from effort and
spontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was
fascinating to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) talk. Being of a more slender figure than Mr.
Jarndyce and having a richer complexion, with browner hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) looked
younger. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had more the appearance in all respects of a
damaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one. There was an
easy negligence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) manner and even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) dress -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hair
carelessly disposed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) neckkerchief loose and flowing, as I
have seen artists paint their own portraits-RRB- which I could not
separate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some
unique process of depreciation. It struck me as being not at all like
the manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the
usual road of years, cares, and experiences.

<p/>I gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated
for the medical profession and had once lived, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) professional
capacity, in the household of a German prince. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) told us, however,
that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had always been a mere child in point of weights and
measures and had never known anything about them -LRB-except that they
disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had never been able to prescribe with the
requisite accuracy of detail. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had no head for
detail. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) told us, with great humour, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was wanted to
bleed the prince or physic any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was generally found
lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) back in bed, reading the newspapers or making
fancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn't come. The prince, at last,
objecting to this, <div class="bookquote">``in which,''  (<font color='red'><b>The prince</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, in the frankest
manner, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was perfectly right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>the engagement terminated, and Mr.
Skimpole having -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) added with delightful gaiety-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``nothing to live
upon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded himself with
rosy cheeks.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) good friend Jarndyce and some other of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) good
friends then helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), in quicker or slower succession, to several
openings in life, but to no purpose, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) must confess to two of
the oldest infirmities in the world: one was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had no idea of
time, the other that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had no idea of money. In consequence of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) never kept an appointment, never could transact any business, and
never knew the value of anything! Well! So he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had got on in life, and
here he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was! He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of
making fancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond
of art. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) asked of society was to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) live. THAT wasn't
much. His (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) wants were few. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) the papers, conversation, music,
mutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of
Bristol-board, and a little claret, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) asked no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was a
mere child in the world, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) didn't cry for the moon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said to
the world, <div class="bookquote">``Go your several ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue
coats, lawn sleeves; put pens behind your ears, wear aprons; go after
glory, holiness, commerce, trade, any object you prefer; only--let
Harold Skimpole live!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>All this and a great deal more he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) told us, not only with the
utmost brilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious
candour--speaking of himself as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) were not at all his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own affair,
as if Skimpole were a third person, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) knew that Skimpole had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) singularities but still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) claims too, which were the
general business of the community and must not be slighted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was
quite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in
endeavouring to reconcile anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said with anything I had
thought about the duties and accountabilities of life -LRB-which I am far
from sure of-RRB-, I was confused by not exactly understanding why he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was
free of them. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was so
very clear about it himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I covet nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.
<div class="bookquote">``Possession is nothing to me. Here is my friend Jarndyce's excellent
house. I feel obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) for possessing it. I can sketch it and
alter it. I can set it to music. When I am here, I have sufficient
possession of it and have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility.
My steward's name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) can't cheat me. We
have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a
strong will and immense power of business detail, who throws herself
into objects with surprising ardour! I don't regret that I have not a
strong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself
into objects with surprising ardour. I can admire her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without envy. I
can sympathize with the objects. I can dream of them. I can lie down
on the grass--in fine weather--and float along an African river,
embracing all the natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and
sketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I
were there. I don't know that it's of any direct use my doing so, but
it's all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then, for heaven's sake,
having Harold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the
world, an agglomeration of practical people of business habits, to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) live and admire the human family, do it somehow or other,
like good souls, and suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) to ride his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) rocking-horse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>It was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the
adjuration. Mr. Skimpole's general position there would have rendered
it so without the addition of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) presently said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only you, the generous creatures, whom I envy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Skimpole, addressing us, his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) new friends, in an impersonal manner. <div class="bookquote">``I
envy you your power of doing what you do. It is what I should revel
in myself. I don't feel any vulgar gratitude to you. I almost feel as
if YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of
enjoying the luxury of generosity. I know you like it. For anything I
can tell, I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of
increasing your stock of happiness. I may have been born to be a
benefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting
me in my little perplexities. Why should I regret my incapacity for
details and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant
consequences? I don't regret it therefore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>Of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) playful speeches -LRB-playful, yet always fully meaning what
they expressed-RRB- none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce
than this. I had often new temptations, afterwards, to wonder whether
it was really singular, or only singular to me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), who was
probably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion, should
so desire to escape the gratitude of others.

<p/>We were all enchanted. I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging
qualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the
first time, should be so unreserved and should lay himself out to be
so exquisitely agreeable. They -LRB-and especially Richard-RRB- were
naturally pleased, for similar reasons, and considered it no common
privilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man. The
more we listened, the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked. And what with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) fine hilarious manner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) engaging candour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) genial way
of lightly tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own weaknesses about, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``I am
a child, you know! You are designing people compared with me''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
really made me consider myself in that light-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``but I am gay and
innocent; forget your worldly arts and play with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>the effect was
absolutely dazzling.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for
what was beautiful or tender that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) could have won a heart by that
alone. In the evening, when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was
touching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cousin Richard, which they had happened to mention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) came and
sat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is like the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``With that golden hair, those
blue eyes, and that fresh bloom on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cheek, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is like the summer
morning. The birds here will mistake her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for it. We will not call
such a lovely young creature as that, who is a joy to all mankind, an
orphan. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is the child of the universe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
and an attentive smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The universe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) observed, <div class="bookquote">``makes rather an indifferent parent, I
am afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``You know the world -LRB-which in your sense
is the universe-RRB-, and I know nothing of it, so you shall have your
way. But if I had mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousins</b></font>)</div>glancing at the cousins, <div class="bookquote">``there should be no
brambles of sordid realities in such a path as that. It should be
strewn with roses; it should lie through bowers, where there was no
spring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual summer. Age or change
should never wither it. The base word money should never be breathed
near it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cousins</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce patted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) on the head with a smile, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had been
really a child, and passing a step or two on, and stopping a moment,
glanced at the young cousins. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) look was thoughtful, but had a
benignant expression in it which I often -LRB-how often!-RRB- saw again,
which has long been engraven on my heart. The room in which they
were, communicating with that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) stood, was only lighted by
the fire. Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), bending
down. Upon the wall, their shadows blended together, surrounded by
strange forms, not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady
fire, though reflecting from motionless objects. Ada touched the
notes so softly and sang so low that the wind, sighing away to the
distant hills, was as audible as the music. The mystery of the future
and the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed
expressed in the whole picture.

<p/>But it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember it, that I
recall the scene. First, I was not quite unconscious of the contrast
in respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed
that way and the flow of words that had preceded it. Secondly, though
Mr. Jarndyce's glance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) withdrew it rested for but a moment on
me, I felt as if in that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) confided to me--and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
confided to me and that I received the confidence--his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hope that Ada
and Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.

<p/>Mr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was
a composer--had composed half an opera once, but got tired of it--and
played what he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) composed with taste. After tea we had quite a little
concert, in which Richard--who was enthralled by Ada's singing and
told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) seemed to know all the songs that ever were
written--and Mr. Jarndyce, and I were the audience. After a little
while I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard, and while I
was thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much,
the maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door, saying, <div class="bookquote">``If
you please, miss, could you spare a minute?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>When I was shut out with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in the hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said, holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
hands, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come
upstairs to Mr. Skimpole's room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) has been took, miss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Took?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Took, miss. Sudden,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said the maid.

<p/>I was apprehensive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) illness might be of a dangerous kind, but
of course I begged her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to be quiet and not disturb any one and
collected myself, as I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) quickly upstairs, sufficiently to
consider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove
to be a fit. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) threw open a door and I went into a chamber, where,
to my unspeakable surprise, instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched
upon the bed or prostrate on the floor, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) standing before
the fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, with a face of great
embarrassment, looked at a person on the sofa, in a white great-coat,
with smooth hair upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head and not much of it, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was
wiping smoother and making less of with a pocket-handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you are come.
You will be able to advise us. Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don't be
alarmed!--is arrested for debt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And really, my dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
agreeable candour, <div class="bookquote">``I never was in a situation in which that
excellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which
anybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter
of an hour in your society, was more needed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>The person on the sofa, who appeared to have a cold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head, gave
such a very loud snort that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) startled me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you arrested for much, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired of Mr. Skimpole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head pleasantly, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know. Some pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think, were
mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's twenty-four pound, sixteen, and sevenpence ha`penny,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>observed
the stranger. <div class="bookquote">``That's wot it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it sounds--somehow it sounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``like a small
sum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>The strange man said nothing but made another snort. It was such a
powerful one that it seemed quite to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Skimpole,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard to me, <div class="bookquote">``has a delicacy in applying to my
cousin Jarndyce because he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) has lately--I think, sir, I understood you
that you had lately--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Though I forgot how much
it was and when it was. Jarndyce would readily do it again, but I
have the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help,
that I would rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) looked at Richard and me, <div class="bookquote">``develop
generosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard,
aside.

<p/>I ventured to inquire, generally, before replying, what would happen
if the money were not produced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jail,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man, coolly putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handkerchief into
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, which was on the floor at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Or Coavinses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask, sir, what is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coavinses?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man. <div class="bookquote">``A `ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard and I looked at one another again. It was a most singular
thing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may
venture on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had
entirely washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) hands of the difficulty, and it had become ours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) suggested, as if good-naturedly to help us out, <div class="bookquote">``that
being parties in a Chancery suit concerning -LRB-as people say-RRB- a large
amount of property, Mr. Richard or his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) beautiful cousin, or both,
could sign something, or make over something, or give some sort of
undertaking, or pledge, or bond? I don't know what the business name
of it may be, but I suppose there is some instrument within their
power that would settle this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``That seems odd, now, to one who is
no judge of these things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Odd or even,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger gruffly, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you, not a bit on
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep your temper!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>Mr. Skimpole
gently reasoned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) made a little drawing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head on
the fly-leaf of a book. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be ruffled by your occupation. We can
separate you from your office; we can separate the individual from
the pursuit. We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private
life you are otherwise than a very estimable man, with a great deal
of poetry in your nature, of which you may not be conscious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger only answered with another violent snort, whether in
acceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
did not express to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my dear Mr. Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Skimpole gaily, innocently, and confidingly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
drawing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head on one side, <div class="bookquote">``here you see me utterly incapable
of helping myself, and entirely in your hands! I only ask to be free.
The butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold
Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I have ten
pounds that I received from Mr. Kenge. I must try what that will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>I possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from my
quarterly allowance during several years. I had always thought that
some accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, without any
relation or any property, on the world and had always tried to keep
some little money by me that I might not be quite penniless. I told
Richard of my having this little store and having no present need of
it, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole, while I should
be gone to fetch it, that we would have the pleasure of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
debt.

<p/>When I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite
touched. Not on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own account -LRB-I was again aware of that perplexing
and extraordinary contradiction-RRB-, but on ours, as if personal
considerations were impossible with him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) and the contemplation of our
happiness alone affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>). Richard, begging me, for the greater
grace of the transaction, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said, to settle with Coavinses -LRB-as
Mr. Skimpole now jocularly called him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)-RRB-, I counted out the money and
received the necessary acknowledgment. This, too, delighted Mr.
Skimpole.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less
than I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white
coat without making any mistakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) put the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pocket and
shortly said, ``Well, then, I'll wish you a good evening, miss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) back to the fire
after giving up the sketch when it was half finished, <div class="bookquote">``I should like
to ask you something, without offence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>I think the reply was, <div class="bookquote">``Cut away, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this
errand?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know'd it yes`day aft`noon at tea-time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Coavinses</b></font>)</div>said Coavinses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It didn't affect your appetite? Didn't make you at all uneasy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Coavinses</b></font>)</div>said Coavinses. <div class="bookquote">``I know'd if you wos missed to-day, you
wouldn't be missed to-morrow. A day makes no such odds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when you came down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``it was a fine
day. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the lights and
shadows were passing across the fields, the birds were singing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody said they warn't, in MY hearing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Coavinses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``But what did you think upon the road?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wot do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong
resentment. <div class="bookquote">``Think! I've got enough to do, and little enough to get
for it without thinking. Thinking!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with profound contempt-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you didn't think, at all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mr. Skimpole, ``to
this effect: ``Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to
hear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows,
loves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature's great
cathedral. And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold
Skimpole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) share in such possessions, which are his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) only
birthright!<div class="bookquote">'' You thought nothing to that effect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--certainly--did--NOT,''  (<font color='red'><b>Coavinses</b></font>)</div>said Coavinses, whose doggedness in utterly
renouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) could only give
adequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each
word, and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have
dislocated his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very odd and very curious, the mental process is, in you men of
business!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my friend.
Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As our absence had been long enough already to seem strange
downstairs, I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the
fireside talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cousin John. Mr. Skimpole presently appeared,
and Richard shortly after him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>). I was sufficiently engaged during the
remainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from
Mr. Jarndyce, who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of
course to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of
the very small use of being able to play when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had no better
adversary. But I thought, occasionally, when Mr. Skimpole played some
fragments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own compositions or when, both at the piano and the
violoncello, and at our table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) preserved with an absence of all
effort his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) delightful spirits and his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) easy flow of conversation, that
Richard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having
been arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether.

<p/>It was late before we separated, for when Ada was going at eleven
o'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that
the best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours
from night, my dear! It was past twelve before he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) candle and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) radiant face out of the room, and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) might have kept us
there, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had seen fit, until daybreak. Ada and Richard were
lingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs.
Jellyby had yet finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) dictation for the day, when Mr.
Jarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me, what's this, what's this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head
and walking about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) good-humoured vexation. <div class="bookquote">``What's this they
tell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have you been doing? Why
did you do it? How could you do it? How much apiece was it? The
wind's round again. I feel it all over me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We neither of us quite knew what to answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Rick, come! I must settle this before I sleep. How much are
you out of pocket? You two made the money up, you know! Why did you?
How could you? Oh, Lord, yes, it's due east--must be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would be honourable in
me to tell you. Mr. Skimpole relied upon us--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, my dear boy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) relies upon everybody!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Jarndyce, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head a great rub and stopping short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir?''

Mr. Jarndyce, walking again at a great pace, with a candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
hand that had gone out. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s always in the same scrape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was born
in the same scrape. I verily believe that the announcement in the
newspapers when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mother was confined was <div class="bookquote">``On Tuesday last, at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
residence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in
difficulties.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard laughed heartily but added, <div class="bookquote">``Still, sir, I don't want to
shake his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) confidence or to break his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) confidence, and if I submit to
your better knowledge again, that I ought to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) secret, I hope
you will consider before you press me any more. Of course, if you do
press me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again, and making several absent
endeavours to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) candlestick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I--here! Take it
away, my dear. I don't know what I am about with it; it's all the
wind--invariably has that effect--I won't press you, Rick; you may be
right. But really--to get hold of you and Esther--and to squeeze you
like a couple of tender young Saint Michael's oranges! It'll blow a
gale in the course of the night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was now alternately putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pockets as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
were going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out again
and vehemently rubbing them all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head.

<p/>I ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole,
being in all such matters quite a child--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Skimpole a child</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Being quite a child, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and so different from other
people--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening. <div class="bookquote">``Your woman's wit
hits the mark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) is a child--an absolute child. I told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was a
child, you know, when I first mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Certainly! Certainly! we said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) IS a child. Now, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jarndyce, brightening
more and more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was indeed, we said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you come to think of it, it's the height of childishness in
you--I mean me--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) for a moment as a
man. You can't make HIM responsible. The idea of Harold Skimpole with
designs or plans, or knowledge of consequences! Ha, ha, ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so delicious to see the clouds about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) bright face clearing,
and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible
not to know, that the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pleasure was the goodness which
was tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any
one, that I saw the tears in Ada's eyes, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) echoed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) laugh,
and felt them in my own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what a cod's head and shoulders I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``to
require reminding of it! The whole business shows the child from
beginning to end. Nobody but a child would have thought of singling
YOU two out for parties in the affair! Nobody but a child would have
thought of YOUR having the money! If it had been a thousand pounds,
it would have been just the same!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) whole
face in a glow.

<p/>We all confirmed it from our night's experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``However, Rick, Esther,
and you too, Ada, for I don't know that even your little purse is
safe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) inexperience--I must have a promise all round that
nothing of this sort shall ever be done any more. No advances! Not
even sixpences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>We all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry glance at me
touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of
OUR transgressing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to Skimpole,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``a habitable doll's house with
good board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow
money of would set the boy up in life. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is in a child's sleep by
this time, I suppose; it's time I should take my craftier head to my
more worldly pillow. Good night, my dears. God bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) peeped in again, with a smiling face, before we had lighted our
candles, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! I have been looking at the weather-cock. I
find it was a false alarm about the wind. It's in the south!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And
went away singing to himself.

<p/>Ada and I agreed, as we talked together for a little while upstairs,
that this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) used the
pretence to account for any disappointment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) could not conceal,
rather than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would blame the real cause of it or disparage or
depreciate any one. We thought this very characteristic of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
eccentric gentleness and of the difference between him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) and those
petulant people who make the weather and the winds -LRB-particularly that
unlucky wind which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had chosen for such a different purpose-RRB- the
stalking-horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours.

<p/>Indeed, so much affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had been added in this one evening
to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
through that mingled feeling. Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr.
Skimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to
reconcile, having so little experience or practical knowledge.
Neither did I try, for my thoughts were busy when I was alone, with
Ada and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive
concerning them. My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps,
would not consent to be all unselfish, either, though I would have
persuaded it to be so if I could. It wandered back to my godmother's
house and came along the intervening track, raising up shadowy
speculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to
what knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even as to
the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) being my father, though that idle dream was
quite gone now.

<p/>It was all gone now, I remembered, getting up from the fire. It was
not for me to muse over bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit
and a grateful heart. So I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, Esther, Esther!
Duty, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a
shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to
bed.




<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>The Ghost's Walk


<p/>While Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather
down at the place in Lincolnshire. The rain is ever falling--drip,
drip, drip--by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-pavement,
the Ghost's Walk. The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire
that the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being
fine again. Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination
on the spot, for Sir Leicester is not here -LRB-and, truly, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
were, would not do much for it in that particular-RRB-, but is in Paris
with my Lady; and solitude, with dusky wings, sits brooding upon
Chesney Wold.

<p/>There may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney
Wold. The horses in the stables--the long stables in a barren,
red-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret, and a
clock with a large face, which the pigeons who live near it and who
love to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting--THEY
may contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions,
and may be better artists at them than the grooms. The old roan, so
famous for cross-country work, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) large eyeball to the
grated window near his (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) rack, may remember the fresh leaves that
glisten there at other times and the scents that stream in, and may
have a fine run with the hounds, while the human helper, clearing out
the next stall, never stirs beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) pitchfork and birch-broom. The
grey, whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient
rattle of his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) halter pricks his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) ears and turns his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) head so wistfully
when it is opened, and to whom the opener says, <div class="bookquote">``Woa grey, then,
steady! Noabody wants you to-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>may know it quite as well as the
man. The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen,
stabled together, may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut
in livelier communication than is held in the servants' hall or at
the Dedlock Arms, or may even beguile the time by improving -LRB-perhaps
corrupting-RRB- the pony in the loose-box in the corner.

<p/>So the mastiff, dozing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kennel in the court-yard with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) large
head on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paws, may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of
the stable-buildings tire his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patience out by changing and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
at one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sits on end, panting and growling short, and very
much wanting something to worry besides himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chain. So
now, half-waking and all-winking, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may recall the house full of
company, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the stables full of
horses, and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses, until
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is.
Then, with that impatient shake of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may growl in the
spirit, <div class="bookquote">``Rain, rain, rain! Nothing but rain--and no family here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn.

<p/>So with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have
their restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been
very obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--upstairs,
downstairs, and in my Lady's chamber. They may hunt the whole
country-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their
inactivity. So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking
in and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with ideas of
the breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons
of interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw. The turkey in
the poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance -LRB-probably
Christmas-RRB-, may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully
taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) got into the lane among the felled trees,
where there was a barn and barley. The discontented goose, who stoops
to pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high, may gabble out, if
we only knew it, a waddling preference for weather when the gateway
casts its shadow on the ground.

<p/>Be this as it may, there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at
Chesney Wold. If there be a little at any odd moment, it goes, like a
little noise in that old echoing place, a long way and usually leads
off to ghosts and mystery.

<p/>It has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that
Mrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several
times taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that
the drops were not upon the glasses. Mrs. Rouncewell might have been
sufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is rather
deaf, which nothing will induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) to believe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is a fine old
lady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a back and
such a stomacher that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) stays should turn out when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) dies to
have been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, nobody who knows
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) would have cause to be surprised. Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell
little. The house is there in all weathers, and the house, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
expresses it, <div class="bookquote">``is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looks at.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) sits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) room -LRB-in a side
passage on the ground floor, with an arched window commanding a
smooth quadrangle, adorned at regular intervals with smooth round
trees and smooth round blocks of stone, as if the trees were going to
play at bowls with the stones-RRB-, and the whole house reposes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered, but it
is shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell's
iron-bound bosom in a majestic sleep.

<p/>It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney
Wold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) has only been here fifty years.
Ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) how long, this rainy day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) shall answer <div class="bookquote">``fifty year,
three months, and a fortnight, by the blessing of heaven, if I live
till Tuesday.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of
the pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) own -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) took
it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)-RRB- in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the
mouldy porch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) was born in the market-town, and so was his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) young
widow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir
Leicester and originated in the still-room.

<p/>The present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
supposes all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dependents to be utterly bereft of individual
characters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was
born to supersede the necessity of their having any. If he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) were to
make a discovery to the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would be simply stunned--would
never recover himself, most likely, except to gasp and die. But he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is
an excellent master still, holding it a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) state to be so.
He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is a most
respectable, creditable woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) always shakes hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) when
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) comes down to Chesney Wold and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) goes away; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) were
very ill, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) were knocked down by accident, or run over, or
placed in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>)
would say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) could speak, <div class="bookquote">``Leave me, and send Mrs. Rouncewell
here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) dignity, at such a pass, safer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) than with
anybody else.

<p/>Mrs. Rouncewell has known trouble. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) has had two sons, of whom the
younger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back. Even
to this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell's calm hands lose their composure when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) speaks of him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), and unfolding themselves from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) stomacher, hover
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) in an agitated manner as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) says what a likely lad, what a
fine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) second
son would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been
made steward in due season, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) took, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) was a schoolboy, to
constructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw
their own water with the least possible amount of labour, so
assisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a
thirsty canary had only, in a literal sense, to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) shoulder to
the wheel and the job was done. This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell
great uneasiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) felt it with a mother's anguish to be a move in
the Wat Tyler direction, well knowing that Sir Leicester had that
general impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a
tall chimney might be considered essential. But the doomed young
rebel -LRB-otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering-RRB-, showing no sign
of grace as he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) got older but, on the contrary, constructing a model
of a power-loom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) was fain, with many tears, to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>)
backslidings to the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sir Leicester,
<div class="bookquote">``I can never consent to argue, as you know, with any one on any
subject. You had better get rid of your boy; you had better get him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
into some Works. The iron country farther north is, I suppose, the
congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Farther north
he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) went, and farther north he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) grew up; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock
ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) came to Chesney Wold to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) mother, or
ever thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) afterwards, it is certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) only regarded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators, swarthy and
grim, who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three
nights in the week for unlawful purposes.

<p/>Nevertheless, Mrs. Rouncewell's son has, in the course of nature and
art, grown up, and established himself, and married, and called unto
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Mrs. Rouncewell's grandson, who, being out of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) apprenticeship,
and home from a journey in far countries, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was sent to
enlarge his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knowledge and complete his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) preparations for the venture
of this life, stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day
in Mrs. Rouncewell's room at Chesney Wold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, again and again, I am glad to see you, Watt! And, once again, I
am glad to see you, Watt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell. <div class="bookquote">``You are a fine
young fellow. You are like your poor uncle George. Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Rouncewell's hands unquiet, as usual, on this reference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say I am like my father, grandmother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), also, my dear--but most like your poor uncle George! And

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thriving, grandmother, in every way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thankful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) son but has a
plaintive feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were a very honourable
soldier who had gone over to the enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is quite happy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>).

best. There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don't

of good company too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) is daughter of a widow in the village. Maids are so

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man inclines his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in acknowledgment of the precepts of
experience. Mrs. Rouncewell listens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheels!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>). They have long been audible to the younger ears
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious
sake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short interval, a tap at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A dark-eyed,
dark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in--so fresh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) rosy and

hair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What company is this, Rosa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's two young men in a gig, ma'am, who want to see the house--yes,
and if you please, I told them so!''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>in quick reply to a gesture of
dissent from the housekeeper. <div class="bookquote">``I went to the hall-door and told them
it was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was
driving took off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it, my dear Watt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>says the housekeeper.

<p/>Rosa is so shy as she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) gives it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) that they drop it between them
and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is
shyer than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Guppy''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is all the information the card yields.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guppy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>repeats Mrs. Rouncewell, <div class="bookquote">``MR. Guppy! Nonsense, I never heard
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) told ME that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div>says Rosa. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) and
the other young gentleman came from London only last night by the
mail, on business at the magistrates' meeting, ten miles off, this
morning, and that as their business was soon over, and they had heard
a great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn't know what to do
with themselves, they had come through the wet to see it. They are
lawyers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn's office, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) is
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn's name if necessary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Finding, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) leaves off, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) has been making quite a long
speech, Rosa is shyer than ever.

<p/>Now, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place,
and besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell's will. The old
lady relaxes, consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour,
and dismisses Rosa. The grandson, however, being smitten by a sudden
wish to see the house himself, proposes to join the party. The
grandmother, who is pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) should have that interest,
accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>)--though to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) is exceedingly
unwilling to trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged to you, ma'am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, divesting himself of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) wet dreadnought in the hall. <div class="bookquote">``Us London lawyers don't often get
an out, and when we do, we like to make the most of it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The old housekeeper, with a gracious severity of deportment, waves
her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hand towards the great staircase. Mr. Guppy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend follow
Rosa; Mrs. Rouncewell and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) grandson follow them; a young gardener
goes before to open the shutters.

<p/>As is usually the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend are dead beat before they have well begun. They straggle
about in wrong places, look at wrong things, don't care for the right
things, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit profound depression
of spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive chamber
that they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as upright as the house
itself, rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens
with stately approval to Rosa's exposition. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) grandson is so
attentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--and prettier. Thus they
pass on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few
brief minutes as the young gardener admits the light, and
reconsigning them to their graves as he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) shuts it out again. It
appears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) inconsolable friend that
there is no end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to
consist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves
for seven hundred years.

<p/>Even the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy's
spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is so low that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) droops on the threshold and has hardly
strength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece,
painted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) like a
charm. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) recovers in a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) stares at it with uncommon
interest; he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) seems to be fixed and fascinated by it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Who's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The picture over the fire-place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div>says Rosa, <div class="bookquote">``is the portrait of the
present Lady Dedlock. It is considered a perfect likeness, and the
best work of the master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind of dismay at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend,
<div class="bookquote">``if I can ever have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). Yet I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)! Has the picture been
engraved, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The picture has never been engraved. Sir Leicester has always
refused permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be shot if it ain't very
curious how well I know that picture! So that's Lady Dedlock, is it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock. The
picture on the left is his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father, the late Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates. <div class="bookquote">``It's
unaccountable to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) says, still staring at the portrait, <div class="bookquote">``how
well I know that picture! I'm dashed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>adds Mr. Guppy, looking round,
<div class="bookquote">``if I don't think I must have had a dream of that picture, you know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>As no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy's dreams,
the probability is not pursued. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) still remains so absorbed by
the portrait that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) stands immovable before it until the young
gardener has closed the shutters, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) comes out of the room in a
dazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for
interest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) sees no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) rooms, which are the last shown,
as being very elegant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) looks out of the windows from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
looked out, not long ago, upon the weather that bored her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to death.
All things have an end, even houses that people take infinite pains
to see and are tired of before they begin to see them. He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) has come to
the end of the sight, and the fresh village beauty to the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
description; which is always this: <div class="bookquote">``The terrace below is much
admired. It is called, from an old story in the family, the Ghost's
Walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious. <div class="bookquote">``What's the story, miss? Is
it anything about a picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray tell us the story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div>says Watt in a half whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know it, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div>Rosa is shyer than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>says the
housekeeper, advancing. <div class="bookquote">``It has never been more than a family
anecdote.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a
picture, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>observes Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``because I do assure you that
the more I think of that picture the better I know it, without
knowing how I know it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>The story has nothing to do with a picture; the housekeeper can
guarantee that. Mr. Guppy is obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) for the information and
is, moreover, generally obliged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) retires with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend, guided
down another staircase by the young gardener, and presently is heard
to drive away. It is now dusk. Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the
discretion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace
came to have that ghostly name.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and
tells them: <div class="bookquote">``In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles the
First--I mean, of course, in the wicked days of the rebels who
leagued themselves against that excellent king--Sir Morbury Dedlock
was the owner of Chesney Wold. Whether there was any account of a
ghost in the family before those days, I can't say. I should think it
very likely indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) considers that a
family of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
regards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, a
genteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Morbury Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell, <div class="bookquote">``was, I have no occasion
to say, on the side of the blessed martyr. But it IS supposed that
his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) Lady, who had none of the family blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) veins, favoured the
bad cause. It is said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had relations among King Charles's
enemies, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was in correspondence with them, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gave
them information. When any of the country gentlemen who followed his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
Majesty's cause met here, it is said that my Lady was always nearer
to the door of their council-room than they supposed. Do you hear a
sound like a footstep passing along the terrace, Watt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear the rain-drip on the stones,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replies the young man, <div class="bookquote">``and I
hear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a halting
step.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The housekeeper gravely nods and continues: <div class="bookquote">``Partly on account of
this division between them, and partly on other accounts, Sir Morbury
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Watt</b></font>) Lady led a troubled life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was a lady of a haughty temper.
They were not well suited to each other in age or character, and they
had no children to moderate between them. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) favourite
brother, a young gentleman, was killed in the civil wars -LRB-by Sir
Morbury's near kinsman-RRB-, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) feeling was so violent that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hated
the race into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had married. When the Dedlocks were about to
ride out from Chesney Wold in the king's cause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is supposed to
have more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night
and lamed their horses; and the story is that once at such an hour,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gliding down the stairs and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) into the
stall where his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own favourite horse stood. There he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) by the
wrist, and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being
frightened and lashing out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was lamed in the hip and from that
hour began to pine away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The housekeeper has dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) voice to a little more than a
whisper.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
never complained of the change; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) never spoke to any one of being
crippled or of being in pain, but day by day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) tried to walk upon
the terrace, and with the help of the stone balustrade, went up and
down, up and down, up and down, in sun and shadow, with greater
difficulty every day. At last, one afternoon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband -LRB-to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
had never, on any persuasion, opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) lips since that night-RRB-,
standing at the great south window, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) drop upon the pavement.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hastened down to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bent over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fixedly and coldly, said, <div class="bookquote">``I will die here
where I have walked. And I will walk here, though I am in my grave. I
will walk here until the pride of this house is humbled. And when
calamity or when disgrace is coming to it, let the Dedlocks listen
for my step!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div><p/>Watt looks at Rosa. Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the
ground, half frightened and half shy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) died. And from those days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell,
<div class="bookquote">``the name has come down--the Ghost's Walk. If the tread is an echo,
it is an echo that is only heard after dark, and is often unheard for
a long while together. But it comes back from time to time; and so
sure as there is sickness or death in the family, it will be heard
then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And disgrace, grandmother--''  (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div>says Watt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>returns the housekeeper.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) grandson apologizes with <div class="bookquote">``True. True.''

 (<font color='red'><b>grandson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the story. Whatever the sound is, it is a worrying sound,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell, getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) chair; <div class="bookquote">``and what is to be
noticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD. My Lady, who is afraid of
nothing, admits that when it is there, it must be heard. You cannot
shut it out. Watt, there is a tall French clock behind you -LRB-placed
there, 'a purpose-RRB- that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can
play music. You understand how those things are managed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, grandmother, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Set it a-going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div><p/>Watt sets it a-going--music and all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, come hither,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>says the housekeeper. <div class="bookquote">``Hither, child, towards my
Lady's pillow. I am not sure that it is dark enough yet, but listen!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So my Lady says.''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>Covering a Multitude of Sins


<p/>It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of
window, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like
two beacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the
indistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the day
came on. As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the
scene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory
over my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects
that had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly
discernible in the mist, and above them the later stars still
glimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and
fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough
to look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only
incongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all
melted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape,
prominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower,
threw a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible
with its rugged character. But so from rough outsides -LRB-I hope I have
learnt-RRB-, serene and gentle influences often proceed.

<p/>Every part of the house was in such order, and every one was so
attentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys,
though what with trying to remember the contents of each little
store-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate
about jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and
china, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a
methodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy
that I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell
ring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been
installed into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they
were all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take
a peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it
quite a delightful place--in front, the pretty avenue and drive by
which we had approached -LRB-and where, by the by, we had cut up the
gravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll
it-RRB-; at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) window up
there, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would have
kissed me from that distance. Beyond the flower-garden was a
kitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard,
and then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with its
three peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large,
some so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the
south-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable,
welcoming look--it was, as Ada said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) came out to meet me with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) arm through that of its master, worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cousin John, a bold
thing to say, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) only pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) dear cheek for it.

<p/>Mr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been overnight.
There was honey on the table, and it led him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) into a discourse about
bees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had no objection to honey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said -LRB-and I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
had not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) seemed to like it-RRB-, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) protested against the
overweening assumptions of bees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) didn't at all see why the busy
bee should be proposed as a model to him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) supposed the bee liked
to make honey, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) wouldn't do it--nobody asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>). It was not
necessary for the bee to make such a merit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) tastes. If every
confectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything
that came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take
notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) work and must not be interrupted, the
world would be quite an unsupportable place. Then, after all, it was
a ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone
as soon as you had made it. You would have a very mean opinion of a
Manchester man if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spun cotton for no other purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea. The
drone said unaffectedly, <div class="bookquote">``You will excuse me; I really cannot attend
to the shop! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to
see and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of
looking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who
doesn't want to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be
the drone philosophy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) thought it a very good philosophy,
always supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the
bee, which, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) knew, the easy fellow always was, if the
consequential creature would only let him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), and not be so conceited
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) honey!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground
and made us all merry, though again he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) seemed to have as serious a
meaning in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was capable of having. I left them
still listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) when I withdrew to attend to my new duties.
They had occupied me for some time, and I was passing through the
passages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr.
Jarndyce called me into a small room next his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) bed-chamber, which I
found to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part
quite a little museum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) boots and shoes and hat-boxes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``This, you must know, is the
growlery. When I am out of humour, I come and growl here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be here very seldom, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you don't know me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``When I am deceived or
disappointed in--the wind, and it's easterly, I take refuge here. The
growlery is the best-used room in the house. You are not aware of
half my humours yet. My dear, how you are trembling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that
benevolent presence, and meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) kind eyes, and feeling so happy
and so honoured there, and my heart so full--I kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hand. I
don't know what I said, or even that I spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was disconcerted and
walked to the window; I almost believed with an intention of jumping
out, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) turned and I was reassured by seeing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) eyes what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had gone there to hide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) gently patted me on the head, and I sat
down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! There!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That's over. Pooh! Don't be foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall not happen again, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``but at first it is
difficult--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's easy, easy. Why not? I hear of a good
little orphan girl without a protector, and I take it into my head to
be that protector. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grows up, and more than justifies my good
opinion, and I remain her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) guardian and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friend. What is there in
all this? So, so! Now, we have cleared off old scores, and I have
before me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, my dear, you surprise me! This really is
not what I expected of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And it had such a good effect that I
folded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself. Mr.
Jarndyce, expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) approval in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face, began to talk to me as
confidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
every morning for I don't know how long. I almost felt as if I had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you don't understand this Chancery
business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And of course I shook my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know who does,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``The lawyers have twisted it
into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case
have long disappeared from the face of the earth. It's about a will
and the trusts under a will--or it was once. It's about nothing but
costs now. We are always appearing, and disappearing, and swearing,
and interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and arguing, and
sealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, and revolving
about the Lord Chancellor and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) satellites, and equitably
waltzing ourselves off to dusty death, about costs. That's the great
question. All the rest, by some extraordinary means, has melted
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) back, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) began to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
head, <div class="bookquote">``about a will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
returned. <div class="bookquote">``A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great fortune,
and made a great will. In the question how the trusts under that will
are to be administered, the fortune left by the will is squandered
away; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable
condition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had
committed an enormous crime in having money left them, and the will
itself is made a dead letter. All through the deplorable cause,
everything that everybody in it, except one man, knows already is
referred to that only one man who don't know, it to find out--all
through the deplorable cause, everybody must have copies, over and
over again, of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of
cartloads of papers -LRB-or must pay for them without having them, which
is the usual course, for nobody wants them-RRB- and must go down the
middle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs
and fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the
wildest visions of a witch's Sabbath. Equity sends questions to law,
law sends questions back to equity; law finds it can't do this,
equity finds it can't do that; neither can so much as say it can't
do anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel
appearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel
appearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the
history of the apple pie. And thus, through years and years, and
lives and lives, everything goes on, constantly beginning over and
over again, and nothing ever ends. And we can't get out of the suit
on any terms, for we are made parties to it, and MUST BE parties to
it, whether we like it or not. But it won't do to think of it! When
my great uncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the
beginning of the end!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) nodded gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) heir, and this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) house, Esther.
When I came here, it was bleak indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had left the signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
misery upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How changed it must be now!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It had been called, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) time, the Peaks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) gave it its
present name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the
wicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to
disentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close. In the
meantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled through the
cracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, the weeds
choked the passage to the rotting door. When I brought what remained
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) home here, the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of
the house too, it was so shattered and ruined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a
shudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down
again with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you this was the growlery, my dear. Where was I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), at the hopeful change he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had made in Bleak House.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bleak House; true. There is, in that city of London there, some
property of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then;
I say property of ours, meaning of the suit's, but I ought to call it
the property of costs, for costs is the only power on earth that will
ever get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but
an eyesore and a heartsore. It is a street of perishing blind houses,
with their eyes stoned out, without a pane of glass, without so much
as a window-frame, with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their
hinges and falling asunder, the iron rails peeling away in flakes of
rust, the chimneys sinking in, the stone steps to every door -LRB-and
every door might be death's door-RRB- turning stagnant green, the very
crutches on which the ruins are propped decaying. Although Bleak
House was not in Chancery, its master was, and it was stamped with
the same seal. These are the Great Seal's impressions, my dear, all
over England--the children know them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How changed it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, so it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) answered much more cheerfully; <div class="bookquote">``and it is wisdom
in you to keep me to the bright side of the picture.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The idea of my
wisdom!-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``These are things I never talk about or even think about,
excepting in the growlery here. If you consider it right to mention
them to Rick and Ada,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>looking seriously at me, <div class="bookquote">``you can. I leave it
to your discretion, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, sir--''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you had better call me guardian, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt that I was choking again--I taxed myself with it, <div class="bookquote">``Esther,
now, you know you are!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) feigned to say this slightly, as if
it were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness. But I gave the
housekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to
myself, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the
basket, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that you may not trust too much to my
discretion. I hope you may not mistake me. I am afraid it will be a
disappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really is
the truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to
confess it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) told me,
with a smile all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) knew me very well indeed and
that I was quite clever enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I may turn out so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but I am much afraid of it,
guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here,
my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) returned playfully; ``the little old woman of the child's
-LRB-I don't mean Skimpole's-RRB- rhyme:


<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Little old woman, and whither so high?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your
housekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to abandon
the growlery and nail up the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Old Woman</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old
Woman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame
Durden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became
quite lost among them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``to return to our gossip. Here's Rick,
a fine young fellow full of promise. What's to be done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) is, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pockets and stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) legs. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) must have a
profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) must make some choice for himself. There will be a
world more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More what, guardian?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More wiglomeration,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's the only name I know for the
thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have
something to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous
sexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the
end of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have something to say about
it; counsel will have something to say about it; the Chancellor will
have something to say about it; the satellites will have something to
say about it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round,
about it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy,
unsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general,
wiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with
wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a
pit of it, I don't know; so it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) began to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head again and to hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) felt the wind. But
it was a delightful instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) kindness towards me that whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head, or walked about, or did both, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face was sure
to recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was
sure to turn comfortable again and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pockets and
stretch out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it would be best, first of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to ask Mr. Richard
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) inclines to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I mean! You know, just
accustom yourself to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet
way, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and Ada, and see what you all make of it. We are sure
to come at the heart of the matter by your means, little woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was
attaining and the number of things that were being confided to me. I
had not meant this at all; I had meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) should speak to
Richard. But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do
my best, though I feared -LRB-I really felt it necessary to repeat this-RRB-
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) thought me much more sagacious than I was. At which my
guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said, rising and pushing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``I think we may
have done with the growlery for one day! Only a concluding word.
Esther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) and
felt sure I understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About myself, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly
colder than I could have wished, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``nothing! I am quite sure
that if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know,
I should not have to ask you to tell it to me. If my whole reliance
and confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard heart
indeed. I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) drew my hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) arm and we went away to look for Ada.
From that hour I felt quite easy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), quite unreserved, quite
content to know no more, quite happy.

<p/>We lived, at first, rather a busy life at Bleak House, for we had to
become acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood
who knew Mr. Jarndyce. It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) who wanted to do anything with anybody else's money. It amazed us
when we began to sort his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) letters and to answer some of them for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the
lives of nearly all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) correspondents appeared to be to form
themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money. The
ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think they were
even more so. They threw themselves into committees in the most
impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite
extraordinary. It appeared to us that some of them must pass their
whole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole
post-office directory--shilling cards, half-crown cards,
half-sovereign cards, penny cards. They wanted everything. They
wanted wearing apparel, they wanted linen rags, they wanted money,
they wanted coals, they wanted soup, they wanted interest, they
wanted autographs, they wanted flannel, they wanted whatever Mr.
Jarndyce had--or had not. Their objects were as various as their
demands. They were going to raise new buildings, they were going to
pay off debts on old buildings, they were going to establish in a
picturesque building -LRB-engraving of proposed west elevation attached-RRB-
the Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys, they were going to give a
testimonial to Mrs. Jellyby, they were going to have their
secretary's portrait painted and presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) mother-in-law,
whose deep devotion to him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) was well known, they were going to get up
everything, I really believe, from five hundred thousand tracts to an
annuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot. They took a
multitude of titles. They were the Women of England, the Daughters of
Britain, the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the
Females of America, the Ladies of a hundred denominations. They
appeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing. They
seemed to our poor wits, and according to their own accounts, to be
constantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing
their candidates in for anything. It made our heads ache to think, on
the whole, what feverish lives they must lead.

<p/>Among the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious
benevolence -LRB-if I may use the expression-RRB- was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who
seemed, as I judged from the number of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) letters to Mr. Jarndyce,
to be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself. We
observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the
subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr.
Jarndyce and prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) going any farther, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had remarked
that there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people who
did a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the people
who did a great deal and made no noise at all. We were therefore
curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) to be a type of the
former class, and were glad when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) called one day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) five
young sons.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose,
and a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) really did, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) knocked down little chairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>)
skirts that were quite a great way off. As only Ada and I were at
home, we received her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) timidly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) seemed to come in like cold
weather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These, young ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility
after the first salutations, <div class="bookquote">``are my five boys. You may have seen
their names in a printed subscription list -LRB-perhaps more than one-RRB- in
the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce. Egbert, my eldest
-LRB-twelve-RRB-, is the boy who sent out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket-money, to the amount of
five and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians. Oswald, my second
-LRB-ten and a half-RRB-, is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to
the Great National Smithers Testimonial. Francis, my third -LRB-nine-RRB-,
one and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth -LRB-seven-RRB-, eightpence to
the Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest -LRB-five-RRB-, has voluntarily
enrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is pledged never,
through life, to use tobacco in any form.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div><p/>We had never seen such dissatisfied children. It was not merely that
they were weazened and shrivelled--though they were certainly that
too--but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent. At the
mention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed
Egbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>) gave
me such a savage frown. The face of each child, as the amount of his (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>)
contribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive
manner, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>) was by far the worst. I must except, however, the
little recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and
evenly miserable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been visiting, I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle, <div class="bookquote">``at Mrs.
Jellyby's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div><p/>We said yes, we had passed one night there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Jellyby,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>pursued the lady, always speaking in the same
demonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) voice impressed my fancy
as if it had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the
opportunity of remarking that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) spectacles were made the less
engaging by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) eyes being what Ada called <div class="bookquote">``choking eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>meaning
very prominent--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves
a helping hand. My boys have contributed to the African
project--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine
weeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest,
according to their little means. Nevertheless, I do not go with Mrs.
Jellyby in all things. I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) treatment
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) young family. It has been noticed. It has been observed that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) young family are excluded from participation in the objects to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) is devoted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) may be right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) may be wrong; but, right
or wrong, this is not my course with MY young family. I take them
everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>I was afterwards convinced -LRB-and so was Ada-RRB- that from the
ill-conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>)
turned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They attend matins with me -LRB-very prettily done-RRB- at half-past six
o'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the
depth of winter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, <div class="bookquote">``and they are with me
during the revolving duties of the day. I am a School lady, I am a
Visiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; I am on
the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; and my
canvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one's more so. But
they are my companions everywhere; and by these means they acquire
that knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing charitable
business in general--in short, that taste for the sort of
thing--which will render them in after life a service to their
neighbours and a satisfaction to themselves. My young family are not
frivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in
subscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many
public meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and
discussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people. Alfred
-LRB-five-RRB-, who, as I mentioned, has of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own election joined the
Infant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who manifested
consciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours
from the chairman of the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div><p/>Alfred glowered at us as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) never could, or would, forgive the
injury of that night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may have observed, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle, <div class="bookquote">``in
some of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of our
esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce, that the names of my young family are
concluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound. That
is their father. We usually observe the same routine. I put down my
mite first; then my young family enrol their contributions, according
to their ages and their little means; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings
up the rear. Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) limited donation,
under my direction; and thus things are made not only pleasant to
ourselves, but, we trust, improving to others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div><p/>Suppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose Mr.
Jellyby were to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, would
Mr. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication to Mr.
Jellyby? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this, but it
came into my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very pleasantly situated here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle.

<p/>We were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, pointed
out the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles appeared to
me to rest with curious indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Mr. Gusher?''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>said our visitor.

<p/>We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher's
acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The loss is yours, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>)
commanding deportment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gusher</b></font>) is a very fervid, impassioned
speaker--full of fire! Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now,
which, from the shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public
meeting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gusher</b></font>) would improve almost any occasion you could mention for
hours and hours! By this time, young ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle,
moving back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency,
a little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket
on it, <div class="bookquote">``by this time you have found me out, I dare say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div><p/>This was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in
perfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after
what I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the colour
of my cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Found out, I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle, <div class="bookquote">``the prominent point in my
character. I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable
immediately. I lay myself open to detection, I know. Well! I freely
admit, I am a woman of business. I love hard work; I enjoy hard work.
The excitement does me good. I am so accustomed and inured to hard
work that I don't know what fatigue is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div><p/>We murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or
something to that effect. I don't think we knew what it was either,
but this is what our politeness expressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if
you try!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle. <div class="bookquote">``The quantity of exertion -LRB-which is no
exertion to me-RRB-, the amount of business -LRB-which I regard as nothing-RRB-,
that I go through sometimes astonishes myself. I have seen my young
family, and Mr. Pardiggle, quite worn out with witnessing it, when I
may truly say I have been as fresh as a lark!''

 (<font color='red'><b>that boy</b></font>)</div><p/>If that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
already looked, this was the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did it. I observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cap, which was under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Pardiggle. ``If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to
say, I tell that person directly, ``I am incapable of fatigue, my good
friend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have done.<div class="bookquote">'' It
answers admirably! Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have your
assistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare's very
soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>At first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general
ground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect.
But as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more
particularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was
inexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very
differently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of
view. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must
be essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, myself, before
I could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good
intentions alone. For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful
as I could, and to render what kind services I could to those
immediately about me, and to try to let that circle of duty gradually
and naturally expand itself. All this I said with anything but
confidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I, and had
great experience, and was so very military in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) manners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wrong, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps you are not
equal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast
difference. If you would like to see how I go through my work, I am
now about--with my young family--to visit a brickmaker in the
neighbourhood -LRB-a very bad character-RRB- and shall be glad to take you
with me. Miss Clare also, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) will do me the favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case,
accepted the offer. When we hastily returned from putting on our
bonnets, we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs.
Pardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the light
objects it contained. Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, and I
followed with the family.

<p/>Ada told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud
tone -LRB-that, indeed, I overheard-RRB- all the way to the brickmaker's
about an exciting contest which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) had for two or three years waged
against another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival
candidates for a pension somewhere. There had been a quantity of
printing, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and it appeared
to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, except the
pensioners--who were not elected yet.

<p/>I am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being
usually favoured in that respect, but on this occasion it gave me
great uneasiness. As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the
manner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>) pocket-money was <div class="bookquote">``boned''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>from him (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>). On my pointing out the
great impropriety of the word, especially in connexion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>)
parent -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>) added sulkily <div class="bookquote">``By her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>) pinched me and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
then! Now! Who are you! YOU wouldn't like it, I think? What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away
again? Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>These exasperating questions so inflamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Egbert</b></font>) mind and the minds of
Oswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once, and in a
dreadfully expert way--screwing up such little pieces of my arms that
I could hardly forbear crying out. Felix, at the same time, stamped
upon my toes. And the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having
the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to
abstain from cakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage
when we passed a pastry-cook's shop that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) terrified me by becoming
purple. I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the
course of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally
constrained children when they paid me the compliment of being
natural.

<p/>I was glad when we came to the brickmaker's house, though it was one
of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties close
to the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors
growing nothing but stagnant pools. Here and there an old tub was put
to catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or they were banked
up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie. At the doors
and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took
little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say
something as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business
and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to
look after other people's.

<p/>Mrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral
determination and talking with much volubility about the untidy
habits of the people -LRB-though I doubted if the best of us could have
been tidy in such a place-RRB-, conducted us into a cottage at the
farthest corner, the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled.
Besides ourselves, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman
with a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a
man, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, lying
at full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful young man
fastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some kind of
washing in very dirty water. They all looked up at us as we came in,
and the woman seemed to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face towards the fire as if to hide
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) voice had not a
friendly sound, I thought; it was much too business-like and
systematic. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, all of you? I am here again. I told you,
you couldn't tire me, you know. I am fond of hard work, and am true
to my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There an't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared at us, <div class="bookquote">``any more on you to come in, is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating herself on one stool
and knocking down another. <div class="bookquote">``We are all here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I thought there warn't enough of you, perhaps?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round upon us.

<p/>The young man and the girl both laughed. Two friends of the young
man, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with
their hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't tire me, good people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pardiggle to these
latter. <div class="bookquote">``I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better
I like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then make it easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>mine</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>growled the man upon the floor. <div class="bookquote">``I wants
it done, and over. I wants a end of these liberties took with my
place. I wants an end of being drawed like a badger. Now you're
a-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know what
you're a-going to be up to. Well! You haven't got no occasion to be
up to it. I'll save you the trouble. Is my daughter a-washin? Yes,
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) IS a-washin. Look at the water. Smell it! That's wot we drinks.
How do you like it, and what do you think of gin instead! An't my
place dirty? Yes, it is dirty--it's nat`rally dirty, and it's
nat`rally onwholesome; and we've had five dirty and onwholesome
children, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them,
and for us besides. Have I read the little book wot you left? No, I
an't read the little book wot you left. There an't nobody here as
knows how to read it; and if there wos, it wouldn't be suitable to
me. It's a book fit for a babby, and I'm not a babby. If you was to
leave me a doll, I shouldn't nuss it. How have I been conducting of
myself? Why, I've been drunk for three days; and I`da been drunk four
if I`da had the money. Don't I never mean for to go to church? No, I
don't never mean for to go to church. I shouldn't be expected there,
if I did; the beadle's too gen-teel for me. And how did my wife get
that black eye? Why, I give it her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says I didn't, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a
lie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth to say all this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now
turned over on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who
had been regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) spectacles with a forcible
composure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
antagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable's staff
and took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious
custody, of course; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) really did it as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) were an
inexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house.

<p/>Ada and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of
place, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on
infinitely better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) had not had such a mechanical way of taking
possession of people. The children sulked and stared; the family took
no notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog
bark, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We
both felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there
was an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend. By
whom or how it could be removed, we did not know, but we knew that.
Even what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such
auditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so
much tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had
referred, we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had
had no other on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) desolate island.

<p/>We were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle
left off.

<p/>The man on the floor, then turning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head round again, said
morosely, <div class="bookquote">``Well! You've done, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For to-day, I have, my friend. But I am never fatigued. I shall come
to you again in your regular order,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pardiggle</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Pardiggle with
demonstrative cheerfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as you goes now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), folding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms and shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes with an oath, <div class="bookquote">``you may do wot you like!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the
confined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped.
Taking one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) young family in each hand, and telling the others
to follow closely, and expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) hope that the brickmaker and
all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house would be improved when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) saw them next, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) then
proceeded to another cottage. I hope it is not unkind in me to say
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show
that was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of
dealing in it to a large extent.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) supposed that we were following her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>), but as soon as the space was
left clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the
baby were ill.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only looked at it as it lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap. We had observed before
that when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at it she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) covered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) discoloured eye with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hand, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished to separate any association with noise and
violence and ill treatment from the poor little child.

<p/>Ada, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to
touch its little face. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) did so, I saw what happened and drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) back. The child died.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>cried Ada, sinking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) knees beside it. <div class="bookquote">``Look here!
Oh, Esther, my love, the little thing! The suffering, quiet, pretty
little thing! I am so sorry for it. I am so sorry for the mother. I
never saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Such compassion, such gentleness, as that with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bent down
weeping and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hand upon the mother's might have softened any
mother's heart that ever beat. The woman at first gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in
astonishment and then burst into tears.

<p/>Presently I took the light burden from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap, did what I could to
make the baby's rest the prettier and gentler, laid it on a shelf,
and covered it with my own handkerchief. We tried to comfort the
mother, and we whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) what Our Saviour said of children.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much.

<p/>When I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and
was standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes, but quiet.
The girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground. The
man had risen. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe with an air of defiance, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent.

<p/>An ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing
at them, and coming straight up to the mother, said, <div class="bookquote">``Jenny! Jenny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman's neck.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) also had upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face and arms the marks of ill usage. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
no kind of grace about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but the grace of sympathy; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
condoled with the woman, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own tears fell, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted no
beauty. I say condoled, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only words were <div class="bookquote">``Jenny! Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>All
the rest was in the tone in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said them.

<p/>I thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and shabby
and beaten, so united; to see what they could be to one another; to
see how they felt for one another, how the heart of each to each was
softened by the hard trials of their lives. I think the best side of
such people is almost hidden from us. What the poor are to the poor
is little known, excepting to themselves and God.

<p/>We felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted. We stole
out quietly and without notice from any one except the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
leaning against the wall near the door, and finding that there was
scarcely room for us to pass, went out before us. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to want
to hide that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did this on our account, but we perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no answer.

<p/>Ada was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom we found
at home, was so distressed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) in tears -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said to me,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was not present, how beautiful it was too!-RRB-, that we
arranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our
visit at the brick-maker's house. We said as little as we could to
Mr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly.

<p/>Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning
expedition. On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-house,
where a number of men were flocking about the door. Among them, and
prominent in some dispute, was the father of the little child. At a
short distance, we passed the young man and the dog, in congenial
company. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other
young women at the corner of the row of cottages, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) seemed
ashamed and turned away as we went by.

<p/>We left our escort within sight of the brickmaker's dwelling and
proceeded by ourselves. When we came to the door, we found the woman
who had brought such consolation with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) standing there looking
anxiously out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's you, young ladies, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
a-watching for my master. My heart's in my mouth. If he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was to catch
me away from home, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'d pretty near murder me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean your husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>I. master</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, my master. Jenny's asleep, quite worn out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s scarcely
had the child off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights,
except when I've been able to take it for a minute or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I. master</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) gave way for us, she (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) went softly in and put what we had
brought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept. No effort
had been made to clean the room--it seemed in its nature almost
hopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which so much
solemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh, and washed, and
neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on my
handkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch of
sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so
lightly, so tenderly!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May heaven reward you!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>we said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are a good woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, young ladies?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) returned with surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Hush! Jenny, Jenny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother had moaned in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sleep and moved. The sound of the
familiar voice seemed to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was quiet once more.

<p/>How little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the
tiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the
child through Ada's drooping hair as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) pity bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head--how
little I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come
to lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast! I only
thought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all
unconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a
hand; not all unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presently, when we had taken leave,
and left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the door, by turns looking, and listening in terror
for herself, and saying in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old soothing manner, <div class="bookquote">``Jenny, Jenny!''




 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>Signs and Tokens


<p/>I don't know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself. I
mean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think
about myself as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find myself
coming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear,
you tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but it is all of
no use. I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that
if these pages contain a great deal about me, I can only suppose it
must be because I have really something to do with them and can't be
kept out.

<p/>My darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found
so much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like
bright-winged birds. Generally in the afternoons, and always in the
evenings, Richard gave us his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) company. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was one of the
most restless creatures in the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) certainly was very fond of
our society.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say
it at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before,
but I found them out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or
show that I knew anything about it. On the contrary, I was so demure
and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within
myself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite
deceitful.

<p/>But there was no help for it. All I had to do was to be quiet, and I
was as quiet as a mouse. They were as quiet as mice too, so far as
any words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which they
relied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one
another was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing
how it interested me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>Richard
would say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
pleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, <div class="bookquote">``that I can't
get on without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Before I begin my harum-scarum day--grinding away
at those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down
dale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it does me so much
good to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend, that
here I am again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Dame Durden, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>Ada would say at night, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head
upon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) thoughtful eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't want to talk when we come upstairs here. Only to sit a little
while thinking, with your dear face for company, and to hear the wind
and remember the poor sailors at sea--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. We had talked it over
very often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation
of the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) interest in
Richard's favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a
gracious manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would be happy to advance the prospects of
the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) power,
which was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) compliments
to the young gentleman -LRB-to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) perfectly remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was
allied by remote consanguinity-RRB- and trusted that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would ever do his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
duty in any honourable profession to which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might devote himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I apprehend it's pretty clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard to me, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall
have to work my own way. Never mind! Plenty of people have had to do
that before now, and have done it. I only wish I had the command of a
clipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor
and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) on short allowance until he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) gave judgment in our cause.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)'d find himself growing thin, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) didn't look sharp!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>With a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever
flagged, Richard had a carelessness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) character that quite
perplexed me, principally because he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mistook it, in such a very odd
way, for prudence. It entered into all his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) calculations about money
in a singular manner which I don't think I can better explain than by
reverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.

<p/>Mr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole
himself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with
instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to
Richard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which
Richard justified by the recovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) ten pounds, and the number
of times he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) talked to me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had saved or realized that amount,
would form a sum in simple addition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said to me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wanted,
without the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the
brickmaker. <div class="bookquote">``I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses' business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of
and never expected to see any more. You don't deny that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! Then I came into possession of ten pounds--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same ten pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hinted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That has nothing to do with it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard. <div class="bookquote">``I have got ten
pounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to
spend it without being particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In exactly the same way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was persuaded out of the sacrifice
of these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
carried that sum to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) credit and drew upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would say. <div class="bookquote">``I saved five pounds out of the
brickmaker's affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back in
a post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have saved
one. And it's a very good thing to save one, let me tell you: a penny
saved is a penny got!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I believe Richard's was as frank and generous a nature as there
possibly can be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
wild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) like a brother in a
few weeks. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gentleness was natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and would have shown
itself abundantly even without Ada's influence; but with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
became one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be
interested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted. I am
sure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and talking
with them, and noticing from day to day how they went on, falling
deeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and each
shyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets, perhaps
not yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was scarcely
less enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the
pretty dream.

<p/>We were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr.
Jarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, said,
<div class="bookquote">``From Boythorn? Aye, aye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>and opened and read it with evident
pleasure, announcing to us in a parenthesis when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was about
half-way through, that Boythorn was <div class="bookquote">``coming down''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>on a visit. Now who
was Boythorn, we all thought. And I dare say we all thought too--I am
sure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all interfere with what was
going forward?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Jarndyce, tapping the letter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) laid it on the table, <div class="bookquote">``more than
five and forty years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) was then the most impetuous boy in the
world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is now the most impetuous man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) was then the loudest
boy in the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is now the loudest man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) was then the
heartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is now the heartiest
and sturdiest man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is a tremendous fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In stature, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>asked Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, Rick, in that respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce; <div class="bookquote">``being some
ten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) head
thrown back like an old soldier, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) stalwart chest squared, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)
hands like a clean blacksmith's, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) lungs! There's no simile for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) lungs. Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the beams of the
house shake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) friend Boythorn, we
observed the favourable omen that there was not the least indication
of any change in the wind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the
passion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Rick--and Ada, and
little Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I
speak of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) language is as sounding as his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
is always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree. In his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
condemnation he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is all ferocity. You might suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to be an ogre
from what he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) says, and I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has the reputation of one with
some people. There! I tell you no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) beforehand. You must
not be surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) take me under his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) protection, for he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has
never forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our
friendship began in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knocking two of my head tyrant's teeth out
-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says six-RRB- before breakfast. Boythorn and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) man,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>to me, <div class="bookquote">``will
be here this afternoon, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr.
Boythorn's reception, and we looked forward to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) arrival with some
curiosity. The afternoon wore away, however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) did not appear.
The dinner-hour arrived, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) did not appear. The dinner was
put back an hour, and we were sitting round the fire with no light
but the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall
resounded with these words, uttered with the greatest vehemence and
in a stentorian tone: <div class="bookquote">``We have been misdirected, Jarndyce, by a most
abandoned ruffian, who told us to take the turning to the right
instead of to the left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is the most intolerable scoundrel on the
face of the earth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) father must have been a most consummate
villain, ever to have such a son. I would have had that fellow shot
without the least remorse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) do it on purpose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jarndyce inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)
whole existence in misdirecting travellers!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other. <div class="bookquote">``By
my soul, I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when
he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) was telling me to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood
before that fellow face to face and didn't knock his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) brains out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Teeth, you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the whole
house vibrate. <div class="bookquote">``What, you have not forgotten it yet! Ha, ha, ha! And
that was another most consummate vagabond! By my soul, the
countenance of that fellow when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was a boy was the blackest image
of perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a
field of scoundrels. If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot
in the streets to-morrow, I would fell him (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) like a rotten tree!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``Now, will you come
upstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By my soul, Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) guest, who seemed to refer to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``if you had been married, I would have turned back at the
garden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya
Mountains sooner than I would have presented myself at this
unseasonable hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite so far, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By my life and honour, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>cried the visitor. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be
guilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house
waiting all this time for any earthly consideration. I would
infinitely rather destroy myself--infinitely rather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Talking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
bedroom thundering <div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and again <div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>until the
flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and
to laugh as enjoyingly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) did or as we did when we heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
laugh.

<p/>We all conceived a prepossession in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) favour, for there was a
sterling quality in this laugh, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) vigorous, healthy voice,
and in the roundness and fullness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) uttered every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
spoke, and in the very fury of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) superlatives, which seemed to go
off like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared
to have it so confirmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was not only a very handsome old gentleman--upright and
stalwart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had been described to us--with a massive grey head, a
fine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become
corpulent but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) being so continually in earnest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) gave it
no rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but
for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to
assist; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was such a true gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) manner, so
chivalrously polite, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face was lighted by a smile of so much
sweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had nothing
to hide, but showed himself exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was--incapable, as Richard
said, of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those
blank great guns because he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) carried no small arms whatever--that
really I could not help looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) with equal pleasure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sat
at dinner, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led
by Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous <div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is the most astonishing bird in Europe!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the
other. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) IS the most wonderful creature! I wouldn't take ten
thousand guineas for that bird. I have left an annuity for his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sole
support in case he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should outlive me. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is, in sense and attachment,
a phenomenon. And his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father before him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was one of the most
astonishing birds that ever lived!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so
tame that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was brought down by Mr. Boythorn's man, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
forefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, alighted
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) master's head. To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the
most implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of
a creature quietly perched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) forehead, was to have a good
illustration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) character, I thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By my soul, Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) said, very gently holding up a bit of
bread to the canary to peck at, <div class="bookquote">``if I were in your place I would
seize every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and
shake him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) until his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) money rolled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bones
rattled in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) skin. I would have a settlement out of somebody, by
fair means or by foul. If you would empower me to do it, I would do
it for you with the greatest satisfaction!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-All this time the very
small canary was eating out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) hand.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at
present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``that it would be greatly
advanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole
bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the
face of the earth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boythorn. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing but a mine below it
on a busy day in term time, with all its records, rules, and
precedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it
also, high and low, upward and downward, from its son the
Accountant-General to its father the Devil, and the whole blown to
atoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it
in the least!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)
recommended this strong measure of reform. When we laughed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) threw
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) head and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) broad chest, and again the whole country
seemed to echo to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It had not the least effect in
disturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete and who
hopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now
on that, turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) were no
more than another bird.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of
way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``You are not free from the toils of the law
yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have
brought actions against HIM for trespass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Boythorn. <div class="bookquote">``By
heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is the proudest fellow breathing. It is morally impossible

to Ada and Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would beg Miss Clare's pardon and Mr. Carstone's pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>resumed
our visitor, <div class="bookquote">``if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley,
``that fellow is, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father was, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) grandfather was, the

conceited and consummate blockheads! But it's no matter; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) should
not shut up my path if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were fifty baronets melted into one and

the same.'' I write to the fellow, ``Mr. Lawrence Boythorn presents his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)

engine--resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the
existence of those lurking ruffians. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brings actions for trespass;
I bring actions for trespass. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brings actions for assault and
battery; I defend them and continue to assault and batter. Ha, ha,
ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>To hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) the angriest of mankind. To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) at the very same
time, looking at the bird now perched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) thumb and softly
smoothing its feathers with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) forefinger, one might have thought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) the gentlest. To hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) laugh and see the broad good nature of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) face then, one might have supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) had not a care in the
world, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) whole existence was a
summer joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock! Though
I willingly confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>here he (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) softened in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``that Lady
Dedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I would
do any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a head
seven hundred years thick, may. A man who joined his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regiment at
twenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and
presumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the
breath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for it--is not
the man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive,
locked or unlocked. Ha, ha, ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor the man to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) junior to be walked over either?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most assuredly not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boythorn, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) on the shoulder
with an air of protection that had something serious in it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)
laughed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will stand by the low boy, always. Jarndyce, you may
rely upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)! But speaking of this trespass--with apologies to Miss
Clare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so
dry a subject--is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and
Carboy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, Esther?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boythorn. <div class="bookquote">``Had no need to ask, after even my
slight experience of Miss Summerson's forethought for every one about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-LRB-They all encouraged me; they were determined to do it.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I
inquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet
been in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down
here. I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) so often in the course of the evening, which passed very
pleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a
satisfaction that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fine face remarkably agreeable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sat
at a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
had small occasion to tell us that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was passionately fond of music,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat at the
backgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) meant to be!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you find out that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) returned with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding
what was in my thoughts, <div class="bookquote">``there is something so tender in his (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) manner,
after all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) is so very courtly and gentle to us, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) eyes to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was sitting as I have just
described him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).

<p/>I said no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) was all but married
once. Long ago. And once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the lady die?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) died to him (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>). That time has had its influence on all his (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)
later life. Would you suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) to have a head and a heart full of
romance yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, guardian, I might have supposed so. But it is easy to say
that when you have told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) has never since been what he (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) might have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce,
<div class="bookquote">``and now you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) age with no one near him (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) but his (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) servant
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) little yellow friend. It's your throw, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt, from my guardian's manner, that beyond this point I could not
pursue the subject without changing the wind. I therefore forbore to
ask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I
thought a little while about this old love story in the night, when I
was awakened by Mr. Boythorn's lusty snoring; and I tried to do that
very difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested
with the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded,
and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother's house. I am
not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is
at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my
life.

<p/>With the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to
Mr. Boythorn informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) that one of their clerks would wait upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) at noon. As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills,
and added up my books, and made all the household affairs as compact
as possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Richard
took advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion, Mr.
Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy's clerk and then was to go
on foot to meet them on their return.

<p/>Well! I was full of business, examining tradesmen's books, adding up
columns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a great
bustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in. I had had
some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young
gentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was glad to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was associated with my present happiness.

<p/>I scarcely knew him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was so uncommonly smart. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had an
entirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid
gloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house
flower in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) little
finger. Besides which, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quite scented the dining-room with
bear's-grease and other perfumery. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked at me with an attention
that quite confused me when I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to take a seat until the
servant should return; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sat there crossing and uncrossing
his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) legs in a corner, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had had a pleasant ride,
and hoped that Mr. Kenge was well, I never looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>), but I found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way.

<p/>When the request was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) would go upstairs to Mr.
Boythorn's room, I mentioned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) would find lunch prepared for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would partake.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the door,
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I replied yes, I
should be there; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) went out with a bow and another look.

<p/>I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) only awkward and shy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was evidently much
embarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to
wait until I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) wanted and then to leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to himself. The lunch was soon brought, but it remained for some
time on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one,
and a stormy one too, I should think, for although his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) room was at
some distance I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) loud voice rising every now and then like a
high wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation.

<p/>At last Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the
conference. <div class="bookquote">``My eye, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)'s a Tartar!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray take some refreshment, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>Mr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the
carving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at me -LRB-as I felt
quite sure without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)-RRB- in the same unusual manner. The
sharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on
me to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you take yourself, miss? You'll take a morsel of
something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy,
hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I have only waited to see that you
have everything you want. Is there anything I can order for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I'm sure. I've everything that I
can require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--I'm
never that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) drank off two more glasses of wine, one after
another.

<p/>I thought I had better go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, rising when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) saw me
rise. <div class="bookquote">``But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private
conversation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Not knowing what to say, I sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What follows is without prejudice, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, anxiously
bringing a chair towards my table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, wondering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's one of our law terms, miss. You won't make any use of it to my
detriment at Kenge and Carboy's or elsewhere. If our conversation
shouldn't lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am not to be
prejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects. In short, it's in
total confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am at a loss, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to imagine what you can have to
communicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but
once; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, miss. I'm sure of it--that's quite sufficient.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>All this
time Mr. Guppy was either planing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) handkerchief
or tightly rubbing the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) left hand with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
right. <div class="bookquote">``If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine, miss, I
think it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that
cannot fail to be mutually unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) did so, and came back again. I took the opportunity of moving well
behind my table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't allow me to offer you one, would you miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Guppy, apparently refreshed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not any,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not half a glass?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Quarter? No! Then, to proceed.
My present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy's, is two
pound a week. When I first had the happiness of looking upon you, it
was one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened
period. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of
five is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve
months from the present date. My mother has a little property, which
takes the form of a small life annuity, upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lives in an
independent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is
eminently calculated for a mother-in-law. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never interferes, is
all for peace, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disposition easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) failings--as who
has not?--but I never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) do it when company was present, at
which time you may freely trust her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with wines, spirits, or malt
liquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is
lowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the
`ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore
you. Would you be so kind as to allow me -LRB-as I may say-RRB- to file a
declaration--to make an offer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) knees. I was well behind my table and not
much frightened. I said, <div class="bookquote">``Get up from that ridiculous position
immediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise
and ring the bell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear me out, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot consent to hear another word, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``Unless you
get up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as
you ought to do if you have any sense at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet what a mockery it is, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) said with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
heart and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head at me in a melancholy manner over the
tray, <div class="bookquote">``to be stationed behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils
from food at such a moment, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you to conclude,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``you have asked me to hear you out,
and I beg you to conclude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``As I love and honour, so likewise I
obey. Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the
shrine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is quite impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and entirely out of the
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and
regarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not
directed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) late intent look, <div class="bookquote">``I am aware that in a
worldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a
poor one. But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don't ring--I have been
brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of
general practice. Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence,
got up cases, and seen lots of life. Blest with your hand, what means
might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your
fortunes! What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you? I know
nothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your
confidence, and you set me on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) addressed my interest or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) supposed to be my
interest quite as unsuccessfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) addressed my inclination, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) would now understand that I requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) pleased, to go
away immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cruel miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``hear but another word! I think you
must have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I
waited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I
could not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps
of the `ackney-coach. It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was
well meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have
walked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby's house only to
look upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to-day,
quite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its
pretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I
speak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my respectful
wretchedness. Love was before it, and is before it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be pained, Mr. Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, rising and putting my hand
upon the bell-rope, <div class="bookquote">``to do you or any one who was sincere the
injustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably
expressed. If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good
opinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to thank
you. I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not proud. I
hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I think I added, without very well knowing what I said, <div class="bookquote">``that
you will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish
and attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy's business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a minute, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about to
ring. <div class="bookquote">``This has been without prejudice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``unless you should give me future
occasion to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``A quarter of a minute, miss! In case you should think better at any
time, however distant--THAT<div class="bookquote">``S no consequence, for my feelings can
never alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I not
do, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if removed, or
dead -LRB-of blighted hopes or anything of that sort-RRB-, care of Mrs.
Guppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be sufficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) written
card upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed. Raising my
eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) went out, I once more saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) looking at me after he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) had
passed the door.

<p/>I sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and payments
and getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and
put everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought
I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went
upstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning to laugh
about it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry
about it. In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as
if an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been
since the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the garden.




<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>The Law-Writer


<p/>On the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more
particularly in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby,
law-stationer, pursues his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) lawful calling. In the shade of Cook's
Court, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in
all sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls
of parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white,
whitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens,
ink, India-rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and
wafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs,
diaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass
and leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small
office-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever
since he (<font color='blue'><b>rulers</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>rulers</b></font>) time and went into partnership with Peffer.
On that occasion, Cook's Court was in a manner revolutionized by the
new inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the
time-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only. For
smoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer's
name and clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite
quite overpowered the parent tree.

<p/>Peffer is never seen in Cook's Court now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) is not expected there,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard
of St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney-coaches roaring
past him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>)
ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in
Cook's Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the
sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street,
whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>)
knows from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) personal observation next to nothing about it--if
Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook's Court, which no
law-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) comes invisibly,
and no one is the worse or wiser.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby's <div class="bookquote">``time''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peffer/PEFFER</b></font>)</div>of seven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same
law-stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something
too violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like
a sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end. The
Cook's Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of
this niece did, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter's childhood, moved by too jealous a
solicitude that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) figure should approach perfection, lace her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
up every morning with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) maternal foot against the bed-post for
a stronger hold and purchase; and further, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exhibited
internally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held,
had mounted to the nose and temper of the patient. With whichsoever
of the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it
either never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby,
who, having wooed and won its fair subject on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) arrival at man's
estate, entered into two partnerships at once. So now, in Cook's
Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the
niece still cherishes her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) figure, which, however tastes may differ,
is unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the
neighbours' thinking, one voice too. That voice, appearing to proceed
from Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook's Court very often. Mr.
Snagsby, otherwise than as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) finds expression through these dulcet
tones, is rarely heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining
head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
tends to meekness and obesity. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) stands at his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) door in Cook's
Court in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at
the clouds, or stands behind a desk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) dark shop with a heavy
flat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) two
`prentices, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in
its grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in
the voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these
reach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the
`prentices, <div class="bookquote">``I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>This proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened
the wit of the Cook's Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the
name of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) might with great force and
expression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) stormy character.
It is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty
shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with
clothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse -LRB-by some supposed to
have been christened Augusta-RRB- who, although she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was farmed or
contracted for during her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) growing time by an amiable benefactor of
his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been
developed under the most favourable circumstances, <div class="bookquote">``has fits,''  (<font color='red'><b>species resident</b></font>)</div>which
the parish can't account for.

<p/>Guster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten
years older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and
is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) patron saint
that except when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is found with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head in the pail, or the sink,
or the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be
near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seizure, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is always at work. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a
satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the `prentices, who feel
that there is little danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inspiring tender emotions in the
breast of youth; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can
always find fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who
thinks it a charity to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>). The law-stationer's establishment
is, in Guster's eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) believes
the little drawing-room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with
its hair in papers and its pinafore on, to be the most elegant
apartment in Christendom. The view it commands of Cook's Court at one
end -LRB-not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street-RRB- and of Coavinses'
the sheriff's officer's backyard at the other she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) regards as a
prospect of unequalled beauty. The portraits it displays in oil--and
plenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs.
Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eyes as achievements of
Raphael or Titian. Guster has some recompenses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) many
privations.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the
business to Mrs. Snagsby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) manages the money, reproaches the
tax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays,
licenses Mr. Snagsby's entertainments, and acknowledges no
responsibility as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) thinks fit to provide for dinner,
insomuch that she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is the high standard of comparison among the
neighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and
even out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually
call upon their husbands to look at the difference between their -LRB-the
wives'-RRB- position and Mrs. Snagsby's, and their -LRB-the husbands'-RRB-
behaviour and Mr. Snagsby's. Rumour, always flying bat-like about
Cook's Court and skimming in and out at everybody's windows, does say
that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is
sometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) had the
spirit of a mouse he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) wouldn't stand it. It is even observed that the
wives who quote him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) to their self-willed husbands as a shining
example in reality look down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) and that nobody does so with
greater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more
than suspected of laying his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) umbrella on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as an instrument of
correction. But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby's
being in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) way rather a meditative and poetical man, loving to walk
in Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the
sparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a
Sunday afternoon and to remark -LRB-if in good spirits-RRB- that there were
old times once and that you'd find a stone coffin or two now under
that chapel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)'ll be bound, if you was to dig for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) solaces his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
imagination, too, by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices, and
Masters of the Rolls who are deceased; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) gets such a flavour of
the country out of telling the two `prentices how he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) HAS heard say
that a brook <div class="bookquote">``as clear as crystial''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>once ran right down the middle of
Holborn, when Turnstile really was a turnstile, leading slap away
into the meadows--gets such a flavour of the country out of this that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) never wants to go there.

<p/>The day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully
effective, for it is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
shop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim
westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook's Court. The crow
flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln's Inn Garden into
Lincoln's Inn Fields.

<p/>Here, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr.
Tulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those
shrunken fragments of its greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in
nuts. But its roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still
remain; and even its painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman
helmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars,
flowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as
would seem to be Allegory's object always, more or less. Here, among
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr.
Tulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where
the great ones of the earth are bored to death. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is to-day,
quiet at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) table. An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open.

<p/>Like as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is to look at, so is his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) apartment in the dusk of
the present afternoon. Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from
attention, able to afford it. Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned,
mahogany-and-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables
with spindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the
holders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one,
environ him (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>). A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>) sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks
that give a very insufficient light to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>) large room. The titles on
the backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>) books have retired into the binding; everything that
can have a lock has got one; no key is visible. Very few loose papers
are about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>) has some manuscript near him (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>), but is not referring
to it. With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of
sealing-wax he (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>) is silently and slowly working out whatever train of
indecision is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rusty</b></font>) mind. Now the inkstand top is in the middle, now
the red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit. That's not it. Mr.
Tulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again.

<p/>Here, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory
staring down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) house and office.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at
elbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened
with business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) wants no
clerks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) clients want HIM; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is all in all. Drafts that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) requires to be
drawn are drawn by special-pleaders in the temple on mysterious
instructions; fair copies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) requires to be made are made at the
stationers', expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in
the pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any
crossing-sweeper in Holborn.

<p/>The red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand top,
the little sand-box. So! You to the middle, you to the right, you to
the left. This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or
never. Now! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) spectacles, puts on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hat, puts the manuscript in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pocket, goes out, tells the
middle-aged man out at elbows, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be back presently.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Very
rarely tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) anything more explicit.

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn goes, as the crow came--not quite so straight, but
nearly--to Cook's Court, Cursitor Street. To Snagsby's,
Law-Stationer's, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in
all its branches, &c., &c., &c.

<p/>It is somewhere about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, and a
balmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook's Court. It hovers about
Snagsby's door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one
and supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into
the subterranean regions to take tea when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) looked out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) door
just now and saw the crow who was out late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div><p/>Guster is minding the shop, for the `prentices take tea in the
kitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker's two
daughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two
second-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two
`prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely
awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won't
grow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/>Master is at home, and Guster will fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>). Guster disappears, glad
to get out of the shop, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) regards with mingled dread and
veneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture
of the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing. Bolts a
bit of bread and butter. Says, <div class="bookquote">``Bless my soul, sir! Mr. Tulkinghorn!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want half a word with you, Snagsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir! Dear me, sir, why didn't you send your young man
round for me? Pray walk into the back shop, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Snagsby has
brightened in a moment.

<p/>The confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse,
counting-house, and copying-office. Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing
round, on a stool at the desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand,
modestly anticipating profit. Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is
accustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save
words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, we did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was one of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly
feeling--tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong
coat-pocket, <div class="bookquote">``the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather
like. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, I
looked in to ask you--but I haven't got it. No matter, any other time
will do. Ah! here it is! I looked in to ask you who copied this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who copied this, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, taking it, laying it flat
on the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a
twist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers. <div class="bookquote">``We gave this out,
sir. We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that
time. I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by referring to
my book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) book down from the safe, makes another bolt of
the bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes
the affidavit aside, and brings his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) right forefinger travelling down
a page of the book, <div class="bookquote">``Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jarndyce! Here we are, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby. <div class="bookquote">``To be sure! I might
have remembered it. This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges
just over on the opposite side of the lane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found it before the
law-stationer, read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WHAT do you call him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)? Nemo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``Nemo, sir. Here
it is. Forty-two folio. Given out on the Wednesday night at eight
o'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nemo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``Nemo is Latin for no one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be English for some one, sir, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby submits
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) deferential cough. <div class="bookquote">``It is a person's name. Here it is, you
see, sir! Forty-two folio. Given out Wednesday night, eight o'clock;
brought in Thursday morning, half after nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>The tail of Mr. Snagsby's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs.
Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) means by
deserting his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) tea. Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs.
Snagsby, as who should say, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, a customer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half after nine, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. Snagsby. <div class="bookquote">``Our law-writers, who
live by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Nemo</b></font>) name, but
it's the name he (<font color='blue'><b>Nemo</b></font>) goes by. I remember now, sir, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nemo</b></font>) gives it in a
written advertisement he (<font color='blue'><b>Nemo</b></font>) sticks up down at the Rule Office, and the
King's Bench Office, and the Judges' Chambers, and so forth. You know
the kind of document, sir--wanting employ?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of
Coavinses', the sheriff's officer's, where lights shine in Coavinses'
windows. Coavinses' coffee-room is at the back, and the shadows of
several gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds. Mr.
Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head to glance
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) shoulder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) little woman and to make apologetic motions
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mouth to this effect: <div class="bookquote">``Tul-king-horn--rich--in-flu-en-tial!''

 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you given this man work before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, yes, sir! Work of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lived?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Across the lane, sir. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodges at a--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby makes
another bolt, as if the bit of bread and buffer were insurmountable
<div class="bookquote">''--at a rag and bottle shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you show me the place as I go back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the greatest pleasure, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby pulls off his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) sleeves and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) grey coat, pulls on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
black coat, takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hat from its peg. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Here is my little
woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) says aloud. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one
of the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with
Mr. Tulkinghorn? Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan't be two minutes, my
love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps
at them through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office,
refers to the entries in the book still lying open. Is evidently
curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find that the place is rough, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby,
walking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to
the lawyer; <div class="bookquote">``and the party is very rough. But they're a wild lot in
general, sir. The advantage of this particular man is that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never
wants sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll go at it right on end if you want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to, as long
as ever you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>It is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired their full
effect. Jostling against clerks going to post the day's letters, and
against counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against
plaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the
general crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has
interposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest
business of life; diving through law and equity, and through that
kindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what
and collects about us nobody knows whence or how--we only knowing in
general that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to
shovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and
bottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise,
lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln's Inn, and kept,
as is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the law-stationer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer unconcernedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not going in, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present. Good
evening. Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hat and returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
little woman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) tea.

<p/>But Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) goes
a short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and
enters it straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so
in the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by
a fire. The old man rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed
candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray is your lodger within?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Male or female, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Krook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Male. The person who does copying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Krook has eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) man narrowly. Knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) by sight. Has an
indistinct impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) aristocratic repute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what I seldom do myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Krook with a grin. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) down? But it's a weak chance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>)'d come, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>), then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Second floor, sir. Take the candle. Up there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>Mr. Krook, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
cat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>), stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after
Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``Hi-hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly
disappeared. The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail. The cat
expands her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) wicked mouth and snarls at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know
what they say of my lodger?''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>whispers Krook, going up a step or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they say of him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) has sold himself to the enemy, but you and I know
better--he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) don't buy. I'll tell you what, though; my lodger is so
black-humoured and gloomy that I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>)'d as soon make that
bargain as any other. Don't put him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) out, sir. That's my advice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) comes to the dark door
on the second floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) knocks, receives no answer, opens it, and
accidentally extinguishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) candle in doing so.

<p/>The air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had not. It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease,
and dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as
if poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low. In the corner
by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness
marked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau
on one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger
one is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. The
floor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of
rope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the
darkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn
together, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them, famine
might be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed.

<p/>For, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork,
lean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just
within the doorway, sees a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lies there, dressed in shirt and
trousers, with bare feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a yellow look in the spectral
darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of
its wick -LRB-still burning-RRB- has doubled over and left a tower of
winding-sheet above it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair is ragged, mingling with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
whiskers and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the
scum and mist around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in neglect. Foul and filthy as the room is,
foul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what fumes
those are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the
general sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco,
there comes into the lawyer's mouth the bitter, vapid taste of opium.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo, my friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cries, and strikes his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) iron candlestick
against the door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) has awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) lies a little turned away,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes are surely open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo, my friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cries again. <div class="bookquote">``Hallo! Hallo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) rattles on the door, the candle which has drooped so long goes
out and leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) in the dark, with the gaunt eyes in the shutters
staring down upon the bed.




<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>Our Dear Brother


<p/>A touch on the lawyer's wrinkled hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) stands in the dark room,
irresolute, makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) start and say, <div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)
ear. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you wake him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you done with your candle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's gone out. Here it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div><p/>Krook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and
tries to get a light. The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
endeavours are vain. Muttering, after an ineffectual call to his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
lodger, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from
the shop, the old man departs. Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new reason
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has, does not await his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) return in the room, but on the stairs
outside.

<p/>The welcome light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly up
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) green-eyed cat following at his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) heels. <div class="bookquote">``Does the man
generally sleep like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>inquired the lawyer in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``Hi!
I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>says Krook, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) head and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) eyebrows.
<div class="bookquote">``I know next to nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) habits except that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeps himself
very close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus whispering, they both go in together. As the light goes in, the
great eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close. Not so the eyes
upon the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God save us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>Krook drops
the heavy hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over
the bedside.

<p/>They look at one another for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send for some doctor! Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir. Here's
poison by the bed! Call out for Flite, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>says Krook, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire's wings.

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Flite! Flite!
Make haste, here, whoever you are! Flite!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Krook follows him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
eyes, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is calling, finds opportunity to steal to the old
portmanteau and steal back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run, Flite, run! The nearest doctor! Run!''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>So Mr. Krook addresses a
crazy little woman who is his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) female lodger, who appears and vanishes
in a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man
brought from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad
Scotch tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ey! Bless the hearts o' ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the medical man, looking up at
them after a moment's examination. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s just as dead as Phairy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn -LRB-standing by the old portmanteau-RRB- inquires if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has
been dead any time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any time, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the medical gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``It's probable he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wull
have been dead aboot three hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About that time, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>observes a dark young man on the
other side of the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquires the
first.

<p/>The dark young man says yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll just tak' my depairture,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replies the other, <div class="bookquote">``for I'm nae
gude here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which remark he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finishes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brief attendance and
returns to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner.

<p/>The dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face
and carefully examines the law-writer, who has established his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pretensions to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name by becoming indeed No one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew this person by sight very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has purchased
opium of me for the last year and a half. Was anybody present related
to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the bystanders</b></font>)</div>glancing round upon the three bystanders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) landlord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from
the surgeon's outstretched hand. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) told me once I was the nearest
relation he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has died,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>says the surgeon, <div class="bookquote">``of an over-dose of opium, there is
no doubt. The room is strongly flavoured with it. There is enough
here now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>taking an old tea-pot from Mr. Krook, <div class="bookquote">``to kill a dozen
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did it on purpose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>asks Krook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Took the over-dose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>Krook almost smacks his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) lips with the unction of a horrible
interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say. I should think it unlikely, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has been in the habit
of taking so much. But nobody can tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was very poor, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was. His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) room--don't look rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>says Krook, who might
have changed eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) cat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) casts his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) sharp glance around.
<div class="bookquote">``But I have never been in it since he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was too close to
name his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) circumstances to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) owe you any rent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Six weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will never pay it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the young man, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) examination.
<div class="bookquote">``It is beyond a doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is indeed as dead as Pharaoh; and to
judge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pharaoh</b></font>) appearance and condition, I should think it a happy
release. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Pharaoh</b></font>) must have been a good figure when a youth, and I dare
say, good-looking.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on
the bedstead's edge with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face towards that other face and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hand upon the region of the heart. <div class="bookquote">``I recollect once thinking there
was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pharaoh</b></font>) manner, uncouth as it was, that denoted a fall
in life. Was that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continues, looking round.

<p/>Krook replies, <div class="bookquote">``You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose
heads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs. Than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pharaoh</b></font>) was my
lodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn't live--by
law-writing, I know no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pharaoh</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div><p/>During this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old
portmanteau, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), equally removed, to all
appearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the
bed--from the young surgeon's professional interest in death,
noticeable as being quite apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) remarks on the deceased as
an individual; from the old man's unction; and the little crazy
woman's awe. His (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
rusty clothes. One could not even say he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) has been thinking all this
while. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention
nor abstraction. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) has shown nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) shell. As easily might
the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case,
as the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) case.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) unmoved,
professional way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I looked in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) observes, <div class="bookquote">``just before you, with the
intention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some
employment at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trade of copying. I had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from my
stationer--Snagsby of Cook's Court. Since no one here knows anything
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>), it might be as well to send for Snagsby. Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to the
little crazy woman, who has often seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) in court, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has
often seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the
law-stationer. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose you do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is gone, the surgeon abandons his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hopeless investigation
and covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane. Mr. Krook and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) interchange a word or two. Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, but
stands, ever, near the old portmanteau.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) grey coat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) black sleeves.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear me, dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``and it has come to this, has it! Bless
my soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you give the person of the house any information about this
unfortunate creature, Snagsby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) was in
arrears with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) rent, it seems. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) must be buried, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, coughing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) apologetic cough behind
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``I really don't know what advice I could offer, except
sending for the beadle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't speak of advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``I could
advise--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one better, sir, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
deferential cough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak of affording some clue to his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) connexions, or to where he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>)
came from, or to anything concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) reply with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of general propitiation, <div class="bookquote">``that I no more know where he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) came
from than I know--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) has gone to, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>suggests the surgeon to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
out.

<p/>A pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer. Mr. Krook,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) connexions, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, ``if a person was to
say to me, ``Snagsby, here's twenty thousand pound down, ready for you
in the Bank of England if you'll only name one of <div class="bookquote">``em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>I couldn't do
it, sir! About a year and a half ago--to the best of my belief, at

shop--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the time!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says Krook with a nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About a year and a half ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>)
came into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my
little woman -LRB-which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation-RRB-
in our shop, produced a specimen of his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) handwriting and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) to
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) was in want of copying work to do and was, not to
put too fine a point upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>a favourite apology for plain speaking
with Mr. Snagsby, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) always offers with a sort of argumentative
frankness, <div class="bookquote">``hard up! My little woman is not in general partial to
strangers, particular--not to put too fine a point upon it--when they
want anything. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was rather took by something about this

of attention, or by what other ladies' reasons, I leave you to judge;

considered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod. In consequence of which,

haven't found Nimrod any work yet!'' or ``Mr. Snagsby, why didn't you
give that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?<div class="bookquote">'' or
such like. And that is the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) gradually fell into job-work at our
place; and that is the most I know of him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) was a quick
hand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
out, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have
it brought in on the Thursday morning. All of which--''  (<font color='red'><b>Nimrod</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby
concludes by politely motioning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hat towards the bed, as much
as to add, <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returns the old man with a sudden grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, <div class="bookquote">``look over the room for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will
get into some trouble or difficulty otherwise. Being here, I'll wait
if you make haste, and then I can testify on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) behalf, if it should
ever be necessary, that all was fair and right. If you will hold the
candle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)'ll soon see whether there is
anything to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place, here's an old portmanteau, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Snagsby.

<p/>Ah, to be sure, so there is! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have
seen it before, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is standing so close to it, and though
there is very little else, heaven knows.

<p/>The marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer
conducts the search. The surgeon leans against the corner of the
chimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.
The apt old scholar of the old school, with his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) dull black breeches
tied with ribbons at the knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) large black waistcoat, his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>)
long-sleeved black coat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) wisp of limp white neckerchief tied
in the bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same
place and attitude.

<p/>There are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau;
there is a bundle of pawnbrokers' duplicates, those turnpike tickets
on the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, smelling of opium,
on which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, such a day, so many
grains; took, such another day, so many more--begun some time ago, as
if with the intention of being regularly continued, but soon left
off. There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers, all referring to
coroners' inquests; there is nothing else. They search the cupboard
and the drawer of the ink-splashed table. There is not a morsel of an
old letter or of any other writing in either. The young surgeon
examines the dress on the law-writer. A knife and some odd halfpence
are all he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) finds. Mr. Snagsby's suggestion is the practical
suggestion after all, and the beadle must be called in.

<p/>So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out
of the room. <div class="bookquote">``Don't leave the cat there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>says the surgeon; <div class="bookquote">``that
won't do!''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>Mr. Krook therefore drives her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
goes furtively downstairs, winding her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) lithe tail and licking her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, and goes home to Allegory and
meditation.

<p/>By this time the news has got into the court. Groups of its
inhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the
army of observation -LRB-principally boys-RRB- are pushed forward to Mr.
Krook's window, which they closely invest. A policeman has already
walked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
stands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) base
occasionally; but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) does see them, they quail and fall
back. Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms
with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in
young Perkins' having <div class="bookquote">``fetched''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Perkins/Perkins</b></font>)</div>young Piper <div class="bookquote">``a crack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Piper/Piper</b></font>)</div>renews her (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>)
friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion. The potboy at the
corner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing official knowledge
of life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally, exchanges
confidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance
of an impregnable youth, unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable
in station-houses. People talk across the court out of window, and
bare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what's
the matter. The general feeling seems to be that it's a blessing Mr.
Krook warn't made away with first, mingled with a little natural
disappointment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) was not. In the midst of this sensation, the
beadle arrives.

<p/>The beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a
ridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the
moment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body. The
policeman considers him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the
barbarous watchmen times, but gives him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) admission as something that
must be borne with until government shall abolish him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). The sensation
is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the
beadle is on the ground and has gone in.

<p/>By and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the sensation,
which has rather languished in the interval. He (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) is understood to be
in want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the
coroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased. Is
immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing
whatever. Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that
Mrs. Green's son <div class="bookquote">``was a law-writer his-self and knowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) better
than anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Green son</b></font>)</div>which son of Mrs. Green's appears, on inquiry, to be
at the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, three months
out, but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the
Lords of the Admiralty. Beadle goes into various shops and parlours,
examining the inhabitants, always shutting the door first, and by
exclusion, delay, and general idiotcy exasperating the public.
Policeman seen to smile to potboy. Public loses interest and
undergoes reaction. Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with
having boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a popular song to that
effect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the
workhouse. Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law
and seize a vocalist, who is released upon the flight of the rest on
condition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Policeman</b></font>) getting out of this then, come, and cutting it--a
condition he (<font color='blue'><b>Policeman</b></font>) immediately observes. So the sensation dies off for the
time; and the unmoved policeman -LRB-to whom a little opium, more or
less, is nothing-RRB-, with his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) shining hat, stiff stock, inflexible
great-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all things fitting, pursues
his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) lounging way with a heavy tread, beating the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) white
gloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a
street-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost
child and a murder.

<p/>Under cover of the night, the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting
about Chancery Lane with his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) summonses, in which every juror's name
is wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle's own
name, which nobody can read or wants to know. The summonses served
and his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook's to keep
a small appointment he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) has made with certain paupers, who, presently
arriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in
the shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which
earthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.

<p/>And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau;
and the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain through
five and forty years, lies there with no more track behind him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) that
any one can trace than a deserted infant.

<p/>Next day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins,
more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation
with that excellent woman. The coroner is to sit in the first-floor
room at the Sol's Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice
a week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional
celebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes
-LRB-according to the bill in the window-RRB- that his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) friends will rally
round him (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) and support first-rate talent. The Sol's Arms does a brisk
stroke of business all the morning. Even children so require
sustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has
established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) brandy-balls go off like smoke. What time the beadle, hovering
between the door of Mr. Krook's establishment and the door of the
Sol's Arms, shows the curiosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) keeping to a few discreet
spirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return.

<p/>At the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are
waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good
dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms. The coroner frequents
more public-houses than any man alive. The smell of sawdust, beer,
tobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) vocation from death
in its most awful shapes. He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) is conducted by the beadle and the
landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) hat on the
piano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of
several short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings
in endless involutions, made by pots and glasses. As many of the jury
as can crowd together at the table sit there. The rest get among the
spittoons and pipes or lean against the piano. Over the coroner's
head is a small iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which
rather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be
hanged presently.

<p/>Call over and swear the jury! While the ceremony is in progress,
sensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a
large shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who
modestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public,
but seems familiar with the room too. A whisper circulates that this
is Little Swills. It is considered not unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will get up
an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the
Harmonic Meeting in the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, gentlemen--''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>the coroner begins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence there, will you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>says the beadle. Not to the coroner,
though it might appear so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>resumes the coroner. <div class="bookquote">``You are impanelled here to
inquire into the death of a certain man. Evidence will be given
before you as to the circumstances attending that death, and you will
give your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be stopped,
you know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything else. The
first thing to be done is to view the body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make way there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>cries the beadle.

<p/>So they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a
straggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook's back
second floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and
precipitately. The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very
neat about the cuffs and buttons -LRB-for whose accommodation he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) has
provided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic
Meeting Room-RRB- should see all that is to be seen. For they are the
public chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) is not
superior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print
what <div class="bookquote">``Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly
and patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according
to the latest examples.

<p/>Little Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.
Mr. Tulkinghorn, also. Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction
and seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a
bagatelle-board, and the coal-box. The inquiry proceeds. The jury
learn how the subject of their inquiry died, and learn no more about
him (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>says the
coroner, <div class="bookquote">``who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery
of the death was made, but he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) could only repeat the evidence you have
already heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the
law-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>). Is anybody in
attendance who knows anything more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins. Mrs. Piper sworn.

<p/>Anastasia Piper, gentlemen. Married woman. Now, Mrs. Piper, what have
you got to say about this?

<p/>Why, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and
without punctuation, but not much to tell. Mrs. Piper lives in the
court -LRB-which her (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) husband is a cabinet-maker-RRB-, and it has long been
well beknown among the neighbours -LRB-counting from the day next but one
before the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen
months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live
such was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) gums-RRB- as the
plaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was
reported to have sold himself. Thinks it was the plaintive's air in
which that report originatinin. See the plaintive often and
considered as his (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go
about some children being timid -LRB-and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins
may be brought forard for she (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) is here and will do credit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>)
husband and herself and family-RRB-. Has seen the plaintive wexed and
worrited by the children -LRB-for children they will ever be and you
cannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be
Methoozellers which you was not yourself-RRB-. On accounts of this and
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dark looks has often dreamed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) take a pick-axe from
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pocket and split Johnny's head -LRB-which the child knows not fear
and has repeatually called after him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) close at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eels-RRB-. Never
however see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far
from it. Has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hurry away when run and called after as if not
partial to children and never see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) speak to neither child nor
grown person at any time -LRB-excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing
down the lane over the way round the corner which if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was here
would tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has been seen a-speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) frequent-RRB-.

<p/>Says the coroner, is that boy here? Says the beadle, no, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) is
not here. Says the coroner, go and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) then. In the absence of
the active and intelligent, the coroner converses with Mr.
Tulkinghorn.

<p/>Oh! Here's the boy, gentlemen!

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged. Now, boy! But stop
a minute. Caution. This boy must be put through a few preliminary
paces.

<p/>Name, Jo. Nothing else that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows on. Don't know that everybody
has two names. Never heerd of sich a think. Don't know that Jo is
short for a longer name. Thinks it long enough for HIM. HE (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) don't find
no fault with it. Spell it? No. HE (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can't spell it. No father, no
mother, no friends. Never been to school. What's home? Knows a
broom's a broom, and knows it's wicked to tell a lie. Don't recollect
who told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) about the broom or about the lie, but knows both. Can't
exactly say what'll be done to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arter he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s dead if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tells a lie
to the gentlemen here, but believes it'll be something wery bad to
punish him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and serve him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right--and so he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll tell the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This won't do, gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>says the coroner with a melancholy shake
of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think you can receive his (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) evidence, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>an juryman</b></font>)</div>asks an
attentive juryman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>says the coroner. ``You have heard the boy.
<div class="bookquote">``Can't exactly say' won't do, you know. We can't take THAT in a court
of justice, gentlemen. It's terrible depravity. Put the boy aside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Boy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially
of Little Swills, the comic vocalist.

<p/>Now. Is there any other witness? No other witness.

<p/>Very well, gentlemen! Here's a man unknown, proved to have been in
the habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half,
found dead of too much opium. If you think you have any evidence to
lead you to the conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) committed suicide, you will come
to that conclusion. If you think it is a case of accidental death,
you will find a verdict accordingly.

<p/>Verdict accordingly. Accidental death. No doubt. Gentlemen, you are
discharged. Good afternoon.

<p/>While the coroner buttons his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) give
private audience to the rejected witness in a corner.

<p/>That graceless creature only knows that the dead man -LRB-whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
recognized just now by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yellow face and black hair-RRB- was sometimes
hooted and pursued about the streets. That one cold winter night when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) crossing, the man
turned to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and came back, and having questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not a friend in the world, said, <div class="bookquote">``Neither have I.
Not one!''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the price of a supper and a night's lodging.
That the man had often spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) since and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
slept sound at night, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore cold and hunger, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ever wished to die, and similar strange questions. That when the man
had no money, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would say in passing, <div class="bookquote">``I am as poor as you to-day,
Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had any, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always -LRB-as the boy most
heartily believes-RRB- been glad to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) some.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was wery good to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>says the boy, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
wretched sleeve. <div class="bookquote">``Wen I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wen</b></font>) a-layin' so stritched out just now, I
wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Wen</b></font>) could have heerd me tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wen</b></font>) so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wen</b></font>) wos wery good to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wen</b></font>)
wos!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), puts a
half-crown in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``If you ever see me coming past your crossing
with my little woman--I mean a lady--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) nose, <div class="bookquote">``don't allude to it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>For some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol's Arms
colloquially. In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of
pipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol's Arms; two stroll to
Hampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night, and
top up with oysters. Little Swills is treated on several hands. Being
asked what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) thinks of the proceedings, characterizes them -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>)
strength lying in a slangular direction-RRB- as <div class="bookquote">``a rummy start.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
landlord of the Sol's Arms, finding Little Swills so popular,
commends him (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) highly to the jurymen and public, observing that for a
song in character he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) don't know his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) equal and that that man's
character-wardrobe would fill a cart.

<p/>Thus, gradually the Sol's Arms melts into the shadowy night and then
flares out of it strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving,
the gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced
-LRB-red-faced-RRB- by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and
support first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little
Swills says, <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, if you'll permit me, I'll attempt a short
description of a scene of real life that came off here to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Is
much applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes
in as the coroner -LRB-not the least in the world like him (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>)-RRB-; describes
the inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment,
to the refrain: With his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) -LRB-the coroner's-RRB- tippy tol li doll, tippy tol
lo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee!

<p/>The jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally
round their pillows. Then there is rest around the lonely figure, now
laid in its last earthly habitation; and it is watched by the gaunt
eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night. If this
forlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the
mother at whose breast he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nestled, a little child, with eyes upraised
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon
the neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the vision would
have seemed! Oh, if in brighter days the now-extinguished fire within
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever burned for one woman who held him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, where is
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), while these ashes are above the ground!

<p/>It is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby's, in Cook's Court,
where Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby himself
allows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into
twenty. The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender
heart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been
imagination, but for Tooting and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) patron saint. Be it what it may,
now, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby's
account of the inquiry at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) had assisted that at supper-time
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) projected herself into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch
cheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only came
out of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of
fits, with short intervals between, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has pathetically
availed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) warning <div class="bookquote">``when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) quite comes to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>and also in appeals to
the whole establishment to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) down on the stones and go to bed.
Hence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in
Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) on the
subject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most
patient of men, <div class="bookquote">``I thought you was dead, I am sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>What question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) settles when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
strains himself to such an extent, or why he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) should thus crow -LRB-so men
crow on various triumphant public occasions, however-RRB- about what
cannot be of any moment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), is his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) affair. It is enough that
daylight comes, morning comes, noon comes.

<p/>Then the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers
as such, comes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) pauper company to Mr. Krook's and bears off
the body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard,
pestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated
to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed,
while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official
back-stairs--would to heaven they HAD departed!--are very complacent
and agreeable. Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would
reject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they
bring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial.

<p/>With houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little
tunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy
of life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of
death in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother down
a foot or two, here sow him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in corruption, to be raised in
corruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful
testimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this
boastful island together.

<p/>Come night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too
long by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the
windows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at
least with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so
sullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its
witch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to
every passerby, <div class="bookquote">``Look here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>every passerby</b></font>)</div><p/>With the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to
the outside of the iron gate. It holds the gate with its hands and
looks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.

<p/>It then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step and
makes the archway clean. It does so very busily and trimly, looks in
again a little while, and so departs.

<p/>Jo, is it thou? Well, well! Though a rejected witness, who <div class="bookquote">``can't
exactly say''  (<font color='red'><b>a witness</b></font>)</div>what will be done to him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) in greater hands than men's,
thou art not quite in outer darkness. There is something like a
distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wen</b></font>) wos wery
good to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wen</b></font>) wos!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Chesney Wold</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>On the Watch


<p/>It has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last, and Chesney
Wold has taken heart. Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares,
for Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris. The
fashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad
tidings to benighted England. It has also found out that they will
entertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the
BEAU MONDE -LRB-the fashionable intelligence is weak in English, but a
giant refreshed in French-RRB- at the ancient and hospitable family seat
in Lincolnshire.

<p/>For the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle, and
of Chesney Wold into the bargain, the broken arch of the bridge in
the park is mended; and the water, now retired within its proper
limits and again spanned gracefully, makes a figure in the prospect
from the house. The clear, cold sunshine glances into the brittle
woods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves
and drying the moss. It glides over the park after the moving shadows
of the clouds, and chases them, and never catches them, all day. It
looks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars
and patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters. Athwart
the picture of my Lady, over the great chimney-piece, it throws a
broad bend-sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the
hearth and seems to rend it.

<p/>Through the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind, my Lady and
Sir Leicester, in their travelling chariot -LRB-my Lady's woman and Sir
Leicester's man affectionate in the rumble-RRB-, start for home. With a
considerable amount of jingling and whip-cracking, and many plunging
demonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two centaurs
with glazed hats, jack-boots, and flowing manes and tails, they
rattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and
canter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of the Rue de
Rivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a headless king and
queen, off by the Place of Concord, and the Elysian Fields, and the
Gate of the Star, out of Paris.

<p/>Sooth to say, they cannot go away too fast, for even here my Lady
Dedlock has been bored to death. Concert, assembly, opera, theatre,
drive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens. Only
last Sunday, when poor wretches were gay--within the walls playing
with children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace
Garden; walking, a score abreast, in the Elysian Fields, made more
Elysian by performing dogs and wooden horses; between whiles
filtering -LRB-a few-RRB- through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a
word or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little
gridiron-full of gusty little tapers; without the walls encompassing
Paris with dancing, love-making, wine-drinking, tobacco-smoking,
tomb-visiting, billiard card and domino playing, quack-doctoring, and
much murderous refuse, animate and inanimate--only last Sunday, my
Lady, in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair,
almost hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own maid for being in spirits.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) cannot, therefore, go too fast from Paris. Weariness of soul lies
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), as it lies behind--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) Ariel has put a girdle of it round
the whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect remedy
is always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced.
Fling Paris back into the distance, then, exchanging it for endless
avenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees! And, when next beheld, let
it be some leagues away, with the Gate of the Star a white speck
glittering in the sun, and the city a mere mound in a plain--two dark
square towers rising out of it, and light and shadow descending on it
aslant, like the angels in Jacob's dream!

<p/>Sir Leicester is generally in a complacent state, and rarely bored.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) has nothing else to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) can always contemplate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) own
greatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so
inexhaustible a subject. After reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) letters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) leans back in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) corner of the carriage and generally reviews his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) importance to
society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my
Lady after a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is fatigued with reading. Has almost read
a page in twenty miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing in it, though. Nothing whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn's long effusions, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester with admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>sighs Lady</b></font>)</div>sighs my Lady. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is the most tiresome of men!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) sends--I really beg your pardon--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) sends,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester,
selecting the letter and unfolding it, <div class="bookquote">``a message to you. Our
stopping to change horses as I came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) postscript drove it out of
my memory. I beg you'll excuse me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester is so
long in taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks
a little irritated. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says ``In the matter of the right of way--' I
beg your pardon, that's not the place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says--yes! Here I have it!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I beg my respectful compliments to my Lady, who, I hope,
has benefited by the change. Will you do me the favour to mention -LRB-as
it may interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)-RRB- that I have something to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) return
in reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery
suit, which so powerfully stimulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) curiosity. I have seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady, leaning forward, looks out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the message,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to walk a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady, still looking out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to walk a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady with unmistakable
distinctness. <div class="bookquote">``Please to stop the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the
rumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an
impatient motion of my Lady's hand. My Lady alights so quickly and
walks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scrupulous
politeness, is unable to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and is left behind. A space of a
minute or two has elapsed before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) smiles,
looks very handsome, takes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, lounges with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a quarter of
a mile, is very much bored, and resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) seat in the carriage.

<p/>The rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three
days, with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking, and more
or less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses. Their courtly
politeness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme
of general admiration. Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady,
says Madame, the hostess of the Golden Ape, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) might be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) amiable father, one can see at a glance that they love each
other. One observes my Lord with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) white hair, standing, hat in
hand, to help my Lady to and from the carriage. One observes my Lady,
how recognisant of my Lord's politeness, with an inclination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
gracious head and the concession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) so-genteel fingers! It is
ravishing!

<p/>The sea has no appreciation of great men, but knocks them about like
the small fry. It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester, whose
countenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in
whose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution. It is the
Radical of Nature to him (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>). Nevertheless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) dignity gets over it
after stopping to refit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) goes on with my Lady for Chesney
Wold, lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire.

<p/>Through the same cold sunlight, colder as the day declines, and
through the same sharp wind, sharper as the separate shadows of bare
trees gloom together in the woods, and as the Ghost's Walk, touched
at the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky, resigns itself to
coming night, they drive into the park. The rooks, swinging in their
lofty houses in the elm-tree avenue, seem to discuss the question of
the occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath, some agreeing
that Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down, some arguing with
malcontents who won't admit it, now all consenting to consider the
question disposed of, now all breaking out again in violent debate,
incited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting
in a last contradictory croak. Leaving them to swing and caw, the
travelling chariot rolls on to the house, where fires gleam warmly
through some of the windows, though not through so many as to give an
inhabited expression to the darkening mass of front. But the
brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that.

<p/>Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester's
customary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mrs. Rouncewell? I am glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health, Sir
Leicester?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In excellent health, Mrs. Rouncewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady is looking charmingly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell with
another curtsy.

<p/>My Lady signifies, without profuse expenditure of words, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is
as wearily well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) can hope to be.

<p/>But Rosa is in the distance, behind the housekeeper; and my Lady, who
has not subdued the quickness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) observation, whatever else she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
may have conquered, asks, <div class="bookquote">``Who is that girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A young scholar of mine, my Lady. Rosa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, Rosa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Lady Dedlock beckons her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), with even an appearance
of interest. <div class="bookquote">``Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) says,
touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shoulder with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) two forefingers.

<p/>Rosa, very much abashed, says, <div class="bookquote">``No, if you please, my Lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div>and
glances up, and glances down, and don't know where to look, but looks
all the prettier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How old are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nineteen, my Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nineteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>repeats my Lady thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Take care they don't spoil
you by flattery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady taps her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers
and goes on to the foot of the oak staircase, where Sir Leicester
pauses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) knightly escort. A staring old Dedlock in a
panel, as large as life and as dull, looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) didn't know what
to make of it, which was probably his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) general state of mind in the
days of Queen Elizabeth.

<p/>That evening, in the housekeeper's room, Rosa can do nothing but
murmur Lady Dedlock's praises. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is so affable, so graceful, so
beautiful, so elegant; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling
touch that Rosa can feel it yet! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this,
not without personal pride, reserving only the one point of
affability. Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that. Heaven
forbid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of
that excellent family, above all, of my Lady, whom the whole world
admires; but if my Lady would only be <div class="bookquote">``a little more free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>not quite
so cold and distant, Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) would be more
affable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis almost a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Rouncewell adds--only <div class="bookquote">``almost''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>because it
borders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it
is, in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs--<div class="bookquote">``that my
Lady has no family. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had had a daughter now, a grown young
lady, to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have had the only kind of
excellence she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might not that have made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) still more proud, grandmother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div>says
Watt, who has been home and come back again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Watt</b></font>) is such a good
grandson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More and most, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>returns the housekeeper with dignity, <div class="bookquote">``are
words it's not my place to use--nor so much as to hear--applied to
any drawback on my Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, grandmother. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is proud, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has reason to be. The Dedlock family have always
reason to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div>says Watt, <div class="bookquote">``it's to be hoped they line out of their
prayer-books a certain passage for the common people about pride and
vainglory. Forgive me, grandmother! Only a joke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, my dear, are not fit subjects for
joking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div>says Watt, <div class="bookquote">``and I humbly ask
his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pardon. I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family and
their guests down here, there is no objection to my prolonging my
stay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller
might?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, none in the world, child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div>says Watt, <div class="bookquote">``because I have an inexpressible
desire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Watt</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Watt</b></font>) happens to glance at Rosa, who looks down and is very shy indeed.
But according to the old superstition, it should be Rosa's ears that
burn, and not her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) fresh bright cheeks, for my Lady's maid is holding
forth about her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) at this moment with surpassing energy.

<p/>My Lady's maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty, from somewhere in
the southern country about Avignon and Marseilles, a large-eyed brown
woman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline
mouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face, rendering the jaws
too eager and the skull too prominent. There is something indefinably
keen and wan about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anatomy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a watchful way of looking
out of the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head which could
be pleasantly dispensed with, especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is in an ill humour
and near knives. Through all the good taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress and little
adornments, these objections so express themselves that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems to
go about like a very neat she-wolf imperfectly tamed. Besides being
accomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) post, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
almost an Englishwoman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acquaintance with the language;
consequently, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for
having attracted my Lady's attention, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) pours them out with
such grim ridicule as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sits at dinner that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) companion, the
affectionate man, is rather relieved when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) arrives at the spoon
stage of that performance.

<p/>Ha, ha, ha! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), Hortense, been in my Lady's service since five years
and always kept at the distance, and this doll, this puppet,
caressed--absolutely caressed--by my Lady on the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
arriving at the house! Ha, ha, ha! <div class="bookquote">``And do you know how pretty you
are, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, my Lady.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You are right there! <div class="bookquote">``And how old are
you, child! And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh, how droll! It is the BEST thing altogether.

<p/>In short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense
can't forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)
countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of
visitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke--an enjoyment
expressed, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) own convivial manner, by an additional tightness of
face, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, which
intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady's
mirrors when my Lady is not among them.

<p/>All the mirrors in the house are brought into action now, many of
them after a long blank. They reflect handsome faces, simpering
faces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not
submit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to
pass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the fashionable
intelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts with a keen
scent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James's to their
being run down to death. The place in Lincolnshire is all alive. By
day guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods, horsemen and
carriages enliven the park roads, servants and hangers-on pervade the
village and the Dedlock Arms. Seen by night from distant openings in
the trees, the row of windows in the long drawing-room, where my
Lady's picture hangs over the great chimney-piece, is like a row of
jewels set in a black frame. On Sunday the chill little church is
almost warmed by so much gallant company, and the general flavour of
the Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes.

<p/>The brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no
contracted amount of education, sense, courage, honour, beauty, and
virtue. Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of
its immense advantages. What can it be?

<p/>Dandyism? There is no King George the Fourth now -LRB-more the pity-RRB- to
set the dandy fashion; there are no clear-starched jack-towel
neckcloths, no short-waisted coats, no false calves, no stays. There
are no caricatures, now, of effeminate exquisites so arrayed,
swooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by
other dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their
noses. There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into
his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) buckskins, or who goes to see all the executions, or who is
troubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea. But is
there dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle
notwithstanding, dandyism of a more mischievous sort, that has got
below the surface and is doing less harmless things than
jack-towelling itself and stopping its own digestion, to which no
rational person need particularly object?

<p/>Why, yes. It cannot be disguised. There ARE at Chesney Wold this
January week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion, who
have set up a dandyism--in religion, for instance. Who in mere
lackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk
about the vulgar wanting faith in things in general, meaning in the
things that have been tried and found wanting, as though a low fellow
should unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it
out! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by
putting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few
hundred years of history.

<p/>There are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new,
but very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world
and to keep down all its realities. For whom everything must be
languid and pretty. Who have found out the perpetual stoppage. Who
are to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing. Who are not to be
disturbed by ideas. On whom even the fine arts, attending in powder
and walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array themselves
in the milliners' and tailors' patterns of past generations and be
particularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress
from the moving age.

<p/>Then there is my Lord Boodle, of considerable reputation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>)
party, who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester
Dedlock with much gravity, after dinner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) really does not see
to what the present age is tending. A debate is not what a debate
used to be; the House is not what the House used to be; even a
Cabinet is not what it formerly was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) perceives with astonishment
that supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited
choice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie
between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be
impossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be
assumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of
that affair with Hoodle. Then, giving the Home Department and the
leadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to
Koodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle,
what are you to do with Noodle? You can't offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) the Presidency of
the Council; that is reserved for Poodle. You can't put him (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) in the
Woods and Forests; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle. What
follows? That the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces
-LRB-as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock-RRB-
because you can't provide for Noodle!

<p/>On the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends
across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the
country--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it
that is in question--is attributable to Cuffy. If you had done with
Cuffy what you ought to have done when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuffy</b></font>) first came into Parliament,
and had prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Cuffy</b></font>) from going over to Duffy, you would have got
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cuffy</b></font>) into alliance with Fuffy, you would have had with you the weight
attaching as a smart debater to Guffy, you would have brought to bear
upon the elections the wealth of Huffy, you would have got in for
three counties Juffy, Kuffy, and Luffy, and you would have
strengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the
business habits of Muffy. All this, instead of being as you now are,
dependent on the mere caprice of Puffy!

<p/>As to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences
of opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and
distinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but
Boodle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) retinue, and Buffy and HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) retinue. These are the
great actors for whom the stage is reserved. A People there are, no
doubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries, who are to be
occasionally addressed, and relied upon for shouts and choruses, as
on the theatrical stage; but Boodle and Buffy, their followers and
families, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, are
the born first-actors, managers, and leaders, and no others can
appear upon the scene for ever and ever.

<p/>In this, too, there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the
brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the
long run. For it is, even with the stillest and politest circles, as
with the circle the necromancer draws around him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>)--very strange
appearances may be seen in active motion outside. With this
difference, that being realities and not phantoms, there is the
greater danger of their breaking in.

<p/>Chesney Wold is quite full anyhow, so full that a burning sense of
injury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies'-maids, and is not
to be extinguished. Only one room is empty. It is a turret chamber of
the third order of merit, plainly but comfortably furnished and
having an old-fashioned business air. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn's room,
and is never bestowed on anybody else, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) may come at any time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is not come yet. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) quiet habit to walk across the park
from the village in fine weather, to drop into this room as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had
never been out of it since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) was last seen there, to request a
servant to inform Sir Leicester that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is arrived in case he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) should
be wanted, and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of
the library-door. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sleeps in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) turret with a complaining
flag-staff over his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) head, and has some leads outside on which, any
fine morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is down here, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) black figure may be seen
walking before breakfast like a larger species of rook.

<p/>Every day before dinner, my Lady looks for him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in the dusk of the
library, but he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is not there. Every day at dinner, my Lady glances
down the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had just arrived, but there is no vacant place. Every night
my Lady casually asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) maid, <div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>maid</b></font>)</div><p/>Every night the answer is, <div class="bookquote">``No, my Lady, not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>One night, while having her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hair undressed, my Lady loses herself in
deep thought after this reply until she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own brooding face in
the opposite glass, and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be so good as to attend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady then, addressing the
reflection of Hortense, <div class="bookquote">``to your business. You can contemplate your
beauty at another time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon! It was your Ladyship's beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady, <div class="bookquote">``you needn't contemplate at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>At length, one afternoon a little before sunset, when the bright
groups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the
Ghost's Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady
remain upon the terrace, Mr. Tulkinghorn appears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) comes towards
them at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) usual methodical pace, which is never quickened, never
slackened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) wears his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) usual expressionless mask--if it be a
mask--and carries family secrets in every limb of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) body and every
crease of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) dress. Whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) whole soul is devoted to the great
or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) yields them nothing beyond the services he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) sells is his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
personal secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) keeps it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) keeps the secrets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) clients;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own client in that matter, and will never betray himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Leicester</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Leicester</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Leicester</b></font>)
hand.

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn is quite well. Sir Leicester is quite well. My Lady
is quite well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hands
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), walks at Sir Leicester's side along the terrace. My Lady
walks upon the other side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We expected you before,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester. A gracious observation.
As much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulkinghorn, we remember your existence when
you are not here to remind us of it by your presence. We bestow a
fragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn, comprehending it, inclines his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is
much obliged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have come down sooner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) explains, <div class="bookquote">``but that I have been
much engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself
and Boythorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man of a very ill-regulated mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester with
severity. <div class="bookquote">``An extremely dangerous person in any community. A man of a
very low character of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is obstinate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is natural to such a man to be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, looking
most profoundly obstinate himself. <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all surprised to hear
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The only question is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>pursues the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``whether you will give up
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replies Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing. I give up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean anything of importance. That, of course, I know you
would not abandon. I mean any minor point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulkinghorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``there can be no minor
point between myself and Mr. Boythorn. If I go farther, and observe
that I cannot readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor
point, I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as
in reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head again. <div class="bookquote">``I have now my
instructions,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of
trouble--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the character of such a mind, Mr. Tulkinghorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester
interrupts him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``TO give trouble. An exceedingly ill-conditioned,
levelling person. A person who, fifty years ago, would probably have
been tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding, and
severely punished--if not,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>adds Sir Leicester after a moment's
pause, <div class="bookquote">``if not hanged, drawn, and quartered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester appears to discharge his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) stately breast of a burden in
passing this capital sentence, as if it were the next satisfactory
thing to having the sentence executed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But night is coming on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and my Lady will take cold. My
dear, let us go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As they turn towards the hall-door, Lady Dedlock addresses Mr.
Tulkinghorn for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened
to inquire about. It was like you to remember the circumstance; I had
quite forgotten it. Your message reminded me of it again. I can't
imagine what association I had with a hand like that, but I surely
had some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had some?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>returns my Lady carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``I think I must have had some.
And did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that
actual thing--what is it!--affidavit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very odd!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor, lighted
in the day by two deep windows. It is now twilight. The fire glows
brightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where,
through the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape
shudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only traveller
besides the waste of clouds.

<p/>My Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner, and Sir
Leicester takes another great chair opposite. The lawyer stands
before the fire with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hand out at arm's length, shading his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) face.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) looks across his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) arm at my Lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I inquired about the man, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And, what
is very strange, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>Lady Dedlock
languidly anticipates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Sir Leicester. Not so much shocked by the
fact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was directed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodging--a miserable, poverty-stricken
place--and I found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will excuse me, Mr. Tulkinghorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``I
think the less said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Sir Leicester, let me hear the story out''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>-LRB-it is my Lady
speaking-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``It is quite a story for twilight. How very shocking!
Dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Whether by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pray</b></font>) own hand--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Really!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do let me hear the story!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever you desire, my dear. But, I must say--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you mustn't say! Go on, Mr. Tulkinghorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester's gallantry concedes the point, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) still feels
that to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is
really--really--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was about to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness,
<div class="bookquote">``that whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had died by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own hand or not, it was beyond my
power to tell you. I should amend that phrase, however, by saying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had unquestionably died of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own act, though whether by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
own deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be
known. The coroner's jury found that he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) took the poison
accidentally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what kind of man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>my Lady asks, <div class="bookquote">``was this deplorable creature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very difficult to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>returns the lawyer, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gipsy colour
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
the commonest of the common. The surgeon had a notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had
once been something better, both in appearance and condition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did they call the wretched being?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They called him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had called himself, but no one knew his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even any one who had attended on him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one had attended on him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was found dead. In fact, I found
him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without any clue to anything more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without any; there was,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer portmanteau</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer meditatively, <div class="bookquote">``an old
portmanteau, but--No, there were no papers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer portmanteau</b></font>)</div><p/>During the utterance of every word of this short dialogue, Lady
Dedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn, without any other alteration in their
customary deportment, have looked very steadily at one another--as
was natural, perhaps, in the discussion of so unusual a subject. Sir
Leicester has looked at the fire, with the general expression of the
Dedlock on the staircase. The story being told, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) renews his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) stately
protest, saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my
Lady's mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch -LRB-unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
was a begging-letter writer-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) trusts to hear no more about a
subject so far removed from my Lady's station.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, a collection of horrors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady, gathering up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
mantles and furs, <div class="bookquote">``but they interest one for the moment! Have the
kindness, Mr. Tulkinghorn, to open the door for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
passes out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) passes close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) usual fatigued manner
and insolent grace. They meet again at dinner--again, next
day--again, for many days in succession. Lady Dedlock is always the
same exhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable
to be bored to death, even while presiding at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) own shrine. Mr.
Tulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble
confidences, so oddly out of place and yet so perfectly at home. They
appear to take as little note of one another as any two people
enclosed within the same walls could. But whether each evermore
watches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great
reservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the
other, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know
how much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their
own hearts.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>We held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first
without Mr. Jarndyce, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had requested, and afterwards with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>),
but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress. Richard
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
might not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had
thought of that, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was. When Mr. Jarndyce asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) thought of the Army, Richard said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had thought of that, too, and
it wasn't a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to try and decide
within himself whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) old preference for the sea was an ordinary
boyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
really HAD tried very often, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) couldn't make out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much of this indecision of character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jarndyce said to me,
<div class="bookquote">``is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and
procrastination on which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has been thrown from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) birth, I don't
pretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is
responsible for some of it, I can plainly see. It has engendered or
confirmed in him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that,
and the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing
everything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused. The character of
much older and steadier people may be even changed by the
circumstances surrounding them. It would be too much to expect that a
boy's, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences and
escape them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I
thought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard's
education had not counteracted those influences or directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
character. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had been eight years at a public school and had learnt,
I understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most
admirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody's
business to find out what his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) natural bent was, or where his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) failings
lay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM. HE (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had been adapted to
the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection
that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had remained at school until he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was of age, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had
enlarged his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) education by forgetting how to do it. Still, although I
had no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and
very sufficient for a great many purposes of life, and always
remembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not
have profited by some one studying him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) a little, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
studying them quite so much.

<p/>To be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know
whether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to
the same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever
did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, musing, <div class="bookquote">``what I had better
be. Except that I am quite sure I don't want to go into the Church,
it's a toss-up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge's way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>replied Richard. <div class="bookquote">``I am fond of boating.
Articled clerks go a good deal on the water. It's a capital
profession!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surgeon--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the thing, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard.

<p/>I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had ever once thought of it before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the thing, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>repeated Richard with the greatest
enthusiasm. <div class="bookquote">``We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was not to be laughed out of it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) laughed at it heartily.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) profession, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) thought of it,
the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) destiny was clear; the art of healing was
the art of all others for him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Mistrusting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) only came to this
conclusion because, having never had much chance of finding out for
himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was fitted for and having never been guided to the
discovery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of
the trouble of consideration, I wondered whether the Latin verses
often ended in this or whether Richard's was a solitary case.

<p/>Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) seriously and to put
it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter.
Richard was a little grave after these interviews, but invariably
told Ada and me that it was all right, and then began to talk about
something else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in
the subject--though I need not say that, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) could do nothing
weakly; <div class="bookquote">``I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry
devoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there is
in it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary
task-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that
illustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is base
and despicable,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Boythorn, <div class="bookquote">``the treatment of surgeons
aboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every
member of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a
transportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if
the system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you give them a week?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Boythorn firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Not on any consideration! Eight and
forty hours! As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, and similar
gatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such
speeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked in quicksilver
mines for the short remainder of their miserable existence, if it
were only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a
language spoken in the presence of the sun--as to those fellows, who
meanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of
knowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of
their lives, their long study, and their expensive education with
pittances too small for the acceptance of clerks, I would have the
necks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in
Surgeons' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order
that its younger members might understand from actual measurement, in
early life, HOW thick skulls may become!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a
most agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, <div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>over and
over again, until anybody else might have been expected to be quite
subdued by the exertion.

<p/>As Richard still continued to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) choice
after repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr.
Jarndyce and had expired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) still continued to assure Ada and me
in the same final manner that it was <div class="bookquote">``all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>it became advisable
to take Mr. Kenge into council. Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to
dinner one day, and leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) chair, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
eye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did
exactly what I remembered to have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) do when I was a little
girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Well! A very good profession, Mr.
Jarndyce, a very good profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently
pursued,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Diligently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that are
worth much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``it is not a special consideration
which another choice would be likely to escape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has so
meritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classic
shades?--in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) youth had been passed, will, no doubt, apply
the habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification in
that tongue in which a poet was said -LRB-unless I mistake-RRB- to be born,
not made, to the more eminently practical field of action on which he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
enters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may rely upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) off-hand manner, <div class="bookquote">``that I
shall go at it and do my best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) means to go at it
and to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) best,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>nodding feelingly and smoothly over those
expressions, <div class="bookquote">``I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into
the best mode of carrying out the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) ambition. Now, with
reference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent
practitioner. Is there any one in view at present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one, Rick, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``As to situation, now. Is there any
particular feeling on that head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Kenge again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like a little variety,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard; <div class="bookquote">``I mean a good range
of experience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very requisite, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``I think this may be
easily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce? We have only, in the first place, to
discover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as we make
our want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?--known, our
only difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number.
We have only, in the second place, to observe those little
formalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our
being under the guardianship of the court. We shall soon be--shall I
say, in Mr. Richard's own light-hearted manner, `going at it'--to our
heart's content. It is a coincidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of
melancholy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) smile, <div class="bookquote">``one of those coincidences which may or may
not require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties, that
I have a cousin in the medical profession. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might be deemed
eligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal. I
can answer for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) as little as for you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) MIGHT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/>As this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr.
Kenge should see his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) cousin. And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed
to take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled next day that we
should make our visit at once and combine Richard's business with it.

<p/>Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at a
cheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer's shop.
London was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hours
at a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable of
exhaustion than we were. We made the round of the principal theatres,
too, with great delight, and saw all the plays that were worth
seeing. I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to
be made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.

<p/>I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richard was
in the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) liked best, behind Ada's chair, when, happening to
look down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hair flattened down
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head and woe depicted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) face, looking up at me. I felt
all through the performance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) never looked at the actors but
constantly looked at me, and always with a carefully prepared
expression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection.

<p/>It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very
embarrassing and so very ridiculous. But from that time forth, we
never went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit, always
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hair straight and flat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) shirt-collar turned down, and a
general feebleness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) were not there when we went in,
and I began to hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) would not come and yielded myself for a little
while to the interest of the scene, I was certain to encounter his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
languishing eyes when I least expected it and, from that time, to be
quite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening.

<p/>I really cannot express how uneasy this made me. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) would only
have brushed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hair or turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) collar, it would have been
bad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at
me, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a
constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to
cry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothing
naturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box,
I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on
having me next them and that they could never have talked together so
happily if anybody else had been in my place. So there I sat, not
knowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy's eyes
were following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this
young man was putting himself on my account.

<p/>Sometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I feared that the
young man would lose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) situation and that I might ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
Sometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by the
possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) black eyes.
Sometimes I thought, should I frown at him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) or shake my head. Then I
felt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I should write
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mother, but that ended in my being convinced that to open a
correspondence would be to make the matter worse. I always came to
the conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr. Guppy's
perseverance, all this time, not only produced him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) regularly at any
theatre to which we went, but caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) to appear in the crowd as we
were coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), two or three times, struggling among the most dreadful
spikes. After we got home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) haunted a post opposite our house. The
upholsterer's where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and
my bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near
the window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) -LRB-as I did one
moonlight night-RRB- leaning against the post and evidently catching
cold. If Mr. Guppy had not been, fortunately for me, engaged in the
daytime, I really should have had no rest from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>).

<p/>While we were making this round of gaieties, in which Mr. Guppy so
extraordinarily participated, the business which had helped to bring
us to town was not neglected. Mr. Kenge's cousin was a Mr. Bayham
Badger, who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large
public institution besides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) was quite willing to receive Richard
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) house and to superintend his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) studies, and as it seemed that
those could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger's roof, and
Mr. Badger liked Richard, and as Richard said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) liked Mr. Badger
<div class="bookquote">``well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>an agreement was made, the Lord Chancellor's consent
was obtained, and it was all settled.

<p/>On the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr.
Badger, we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger's house.
We were to be <div class="bookquote">``merely a family party,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Badger's note said; and
we found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) was surrounded in
the drawing-room by various objects, indicative of her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) painting a
little, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar a little,
playing the harp a little, singing a little, working a little,
reading a little, writing poetry a little, and botanizing a little.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) was a lady of about fifty, I should think, youthfully dressed,
and of a very fine complexion. If I add to the little list of her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>)
accomplishments that she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) rouged a little, I do not mean that there
was any harm in it.

<p/>Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-looking
gentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprised
eyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>)
admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) exceedingly, but principally, and to begin with, on the
curious ground -LRB-as it seemed to us-RRB- of her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) having had three husbands.
We had barely taken our seats when he (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) said to Mr. Jarndyce quite
triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham
Badger's third!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) third!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bayham Badger has not the
appearance, Miss Summerson, of a lady who has had two former
husbands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said <div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And most remarkable men!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence.
<div class="bookquote">``Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger's first
husband, was a very distinguished officer indeed. The name of
Professor Dingo, my immediate predecessor, is one of European
reputation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Badger overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) and smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>Mr. Badger replied to the smile, <div class="bookquote">``I was observing to
Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former
husbands--both very distinguished men. And they found it, as people
generally do, difficult to believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was barely twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``when I married Captain
Swosser of the Royal Navy. I was in the Mediterranean with him (<font color='blue'><b>Navy</b></font>); I am
quite a sailor. On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day, I
became the wife of Professor Dingo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of European reputation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Badger in an undertone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when Mr. Badger and myself were married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs. Badger,
<div class="bookquote">``we were married on the same day of the year. I had become attached
to the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands--two of them
highly distinguished men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger, summing up the facts,
<div class="bookquote">``and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in the
forenoon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/>We all expressed our admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But for Mr. Badger's modesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``I would take
leave to correct him (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) and say three distinguished men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs.
Badger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``what do I always tell you? That
without any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction
as I may have attained -LRB-which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many
opportunities of estimating-RRB-, I am not so weak--no, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Badger to us generally, <div class="bookquote">``so unreasonable--as to put my reputation on
the same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and
Professor Dingo. Perhaps you may be interested, Mr. Jarndyce,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Bayham Badger, leading the way into the next
drawing-room, <div class="bookquote">``in this portrait of Captain Swosser. It was taken on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) return home from the African station, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had suffered from
the fever of the country. Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow. But
it's a very fine head. A very fine head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/>We all echoed, <div class="bookquote">``A very fine head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel when I look at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger, <div class="bookquote">''`That's a man I should
like to have seen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that
Captain Swosser pre-eminently was. On the other side, Professor
Dingo. I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) well--attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) last illness--a speaking
likeness! Over the piano, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser. Over
the sofa, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo. Of Mrs. Bayham Badger
IN ESSE, I possess the original and have no copy.''

<p/>Dinner was now announced, and we went downstairs. It was a very
genteel entertainment, very handsomely served. But the captain and
the professor still ran in Mr. Badger's head, and as Ada and I had
the honour of being under his (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) particular care, we had the full
benefit of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water, Miss Summerson? Allow me! Not in that tumbler, pray. Bring me
the professor's goblet, James!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Astonishing how they keep!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger. <div class="bookquote">``They were presented to
Mrs. Bayham Badger when she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) was in the Mediterranean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that claret!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me! This is an occasion, and ON
an occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.
-LRB-James, Captain Swosser's wine!-RRB- Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that
was imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago. You
will find it very curious. My dear, I shall be happy to take some of
this wine with you. -LRB-Captain Swosser's claret to your mistress,
James!-RRB- My love, your health!''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>After dinner, when we ladies retired, we took Mrs. Badger's first and
second husband with us. Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a
biographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) marriage and a more minute account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) dating from the
time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fell in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) at a ball on board the Crippler,
given to the officers of that ship when she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) lay in Plymouth Harbour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dear old Crippler!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Badger, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was
a noble vessel. Trim, ship-shape, all a taunto, as Captain Swosser
used to say. You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a
nautical expression; I was quite a sailor once. Captain Swosser loved
that craft for my sake. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was no longer in commission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
frequently said that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were rich enough to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) old hulk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
would have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck
where we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
fell--raked fore and aft -LRB-Captain Swosser used to say-RRB- by the fire
from my tops. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) naval way of mentioning my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Badger shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) head, sighed, and looked in the glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>)
resumed with a plaintive smile. <div class="bookquote">``I felt it a good deal at first. Such
an entire revolution in my mode of life! But custom, combined with
science--particularly science--inured me to it. Being the professor's
sole companion in his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) botanical excursions, I almost forgot that I
had ever been afloat, and became quite learned. It is singular that
the professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr.
Badger is not in the least like either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>We then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and
Professor Dingo, both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints.
In the course of it, Mrs. Badger signified to us that she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) had never
madly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection,
never to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm, was Captain Swosser.
The professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner, and
Mrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) way of saying, with great
difficulty, <div class="bookquote">``Where is Laura? Let Laura give me my toast and water!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>when the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to the tomb.

<p/>Now, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past,
that Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other's
society, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to be
separated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised when we
got home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent
than usual, though I was not quite prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) coming into my
arms and beginning to speak to me, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face hidden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>murmured Ada. <div class="bookquote">``I have a great secret to tell
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Ada?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, you would never guess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I try to guess?''  (<font color='red'><b>I. no</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! Don't! Pray don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>I. no</b></font>)</div>cried Ada, very much startled by the
idea of my doing so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I wonder who it can be about?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, pretending to consider.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's about--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``It's about--my cousin
Richard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my own!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bright hair, which was all I
could see. <div class="bookquote">``And what about him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, you would never guess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so pretty to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) clinging to me in that way, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
face, and to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was not crying in sorrow but in a little
glow of joy, and pride, and hope, that I would not help her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) just yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) says--I know it's very foolish, we are both so young--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
says,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a burst of tears, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) loves me dearly, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard of such a thing! Why, my pet
of pets, I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>To see Ada lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) flushed face in joyful surprise, and hold me
round the neck, and laugh, and cry, and blush, was so pleasant!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``what a goose you must take me for! Your
cousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could for I don't
know how long!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet you never said a word about it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>cried Ada, kissing me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I waited to be told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>returned Ada. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the
hardest-hearted duenna in the world. Not being that yet, I said no
very freely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I know the worst of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's not quite the worst of it, Esther dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>cried Ada,
holding me tighter and laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face again upon my breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Not even that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not even that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you never mean to say--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was beginning in joke.

<p/>But Ada, looking up and smiling through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) tears, cried, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do!
You know, you know I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>And then sobbed out, <div class="bookquote">``With all my heart I
do! With all my whole heart, Esther!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as I
had known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all the
talking to myself for a little while -LRB-though there was not much of
it-RRB-; and Ada was soon quiet and happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless my cousin John is blind, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I should think my
cousin John knows pretty well as much as we know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We want to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) before Richard goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada timidly, <div class="bookquote">``and
we wanted you to advise us, and to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) so. Perhaps you wouldn't
mind Richard's coming in, Dame Durden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Richard is outside, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not quite certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that
would have won my heart if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had not won it long before, <div class="bookquote">``but I
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'s waiting at the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was, of course. They brought a chair on either side of me,
and put me between them, and really seemed to have fallen in love
with me instead of one another, they were so confiding, and so
trustful, and so fond of me. They went on in their own wild way for a
little while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and
then we gradually fell to considering how young they were, and how
there must be a lapse of several years before this early love could
come to anything, and how it could come to happiness only if it were
real and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do
their duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, and
perseverance, each always for the other's sake. Well! Richard said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would work his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada said that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) would work her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) fingers to the bone for Richard, and they called
me all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we sat there,
advising and talking, half the night. Finally, before we parted, I
gave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow.

<p/>So, when to-morrow came, I went to my guardian after breakfast, in
the room that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
that I had it in trust to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), shutting up his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) book, <div class="bookquote">``if you have
accepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I can guarantee that there is no
secrecy in it. For it only happened yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye? And what is it, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you remember the happy night when first we came
down to Bleak House? When Ada was singing in the dark room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I wished to call to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) remembrance the look he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had given me then.
Unless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I with a little hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have
told each other so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Already!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>cried my guardian, quite astonished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And to tell you the truth, guardian, I rather
expected it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce you did!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat considering for a minute or two, with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) smile, at once so
handsome and so kind, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) changing face, and then requested me
to let them know that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wished to see them. When they came, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
encircled Ada with one arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fatherly way and addressed himself
to Richard with a cheerful gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have won your confidence. I
hope to preserve it. When I contemplated these relations between us
four which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new
interests and pleasures, I certainly did contemplate, afar off, the
possibility of you and your pretty cousin here -LRB-don't be shy, Ada,
don't be shy, my dear!-RRB- being in a mind to go through life together.
I saw, and do see, many reasons to make it desirable. But that was
afar off, Rick, afar off!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We look afar off, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``That's rational. Now, hear me, my dears!
I might tell you that you don't know your own minds yet, that a
thousand things may happen to divert you from one another, that it is
well this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken,
or it might become a chain of lead. But I will not do that. Such
wisdom will come soon enough, I dare say, if it is to come at all. I
will assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one
another what you are to-day. All I say before speaking to you
according to that assumption is, if you DO change--if you DO come to
find that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and
woman than you were as boy and girl -LRB-your manhood will excuse me,
Rick!-RRB---don't be ashamed still to confide in me, for there will be
nothing monstrous or uncommon in it. I am only your friend and
distant kinsman. I have no power over you whatever. But I wish and
hope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sure, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, <div class="bookquote">``that I speak for Ada too
when I say that you have the strongest power over us both--rooted in
respect, gratitude, and affection--strengthening every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear cousin John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``my father's place can
never be empty again. All the love and duty I could ever have
rendered to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is transferred to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``Now for our assumption. Now we lift our
eyes up and look hopefully at the distance! Rick, the world is before
you; and it is most probable that as you enter it, so it will receive
you. Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts. Never
separate the two, like the heathen waggoner. Constancy in love is a
good thing, but it means nothing, and is nothing, without constancy
in every kind of effort. If you had the abilities of all the great
men, past and present, you could do nothing well without sincerely
meaning it and setting about it. If you entertain the supposition
that any real success, in great things or in small, ever was or could
be, ever will or can be, wrested from Fortune by fits and starts,
leave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will leave IT here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>replied Richard smiling, <div class="bookquote">``if I brought
it here just now -LRB-but I hope I did not-RRB-, and will work my way on to
my cousin Ada in the hopeful distance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``If you are not to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) happy, why
should you pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) unhappy--no, not even for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>retorted
Richard proudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``That's well said! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) remains here,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) home with me. Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), Rick, in your active life, no less
than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) home when you revisit it, and all will go well.
Otherwise, all will go ill. That's the end of my preaching. I think
you and Ada had better take a walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada tenderly embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), and Richard heartily shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>),
and then the cousins went out of the room, looking back again
directly, though, to say that they would wait for me.

<p/>The door stood open, and we both followed them with our eyes as they
passed down the adjoining room, on which the sun was shining, and out
at its farther end. Richard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head bent, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hand drawn
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arm, was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) very earnestly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) looked up
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face, listening, and seemed to see nothing else. So young, so
beautiful, so full of hope and promise, they went on lightly through
the sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the
years to come and making them all years of brightness. So they passed
away into the shadow and were gone. It was only a burst of light that
had been so radiant. The room darkened as they went out, and the sun
was clouded over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I right, Esther?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian when they were gone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was so good and wise to ask ME whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was right!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rick may gain, out of this, the quality he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) wants. Wants, at the core
of so much that is good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I
have said nothing to Ada, Esther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) friend and counsellor
always near.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hand lovingly upon my head.

<p/>I could not help showing that I was a little moved, though I did all
I could to conceal it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut tut!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But we must take care, too, that our little
woman's life is not all consumed in care for others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Care? My dear guardian, I believe I am the happiest creature in the
world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But some one may find out what Esther
never will--that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above
all other people!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one else
at the family dinner party. It was not a lady. It was a gentleman. It
was a gentleman of a dark complexion--a young surgeon. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was rather
reserved, but I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) very sensible and agreeable. At least,
Ada asked me if I did not, and I said yes.




<p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>Deportment


<p/>Richard left us on the very next evening to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) new career, and
committed Ada to my charge with great love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and great trust in
me. It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more
nearly, to remember -LRB-having what I have to tell-RRB- how they both
thought of me, even at that engrossing time. I was a part of all
their plans, for the present and the future. I was to write Richard
once a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who was to write to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) every alternate day. I was to be informed, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own hand, of
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) labours and successes; I was to observe how resolute and
persevering he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would be; I was to be Ada's bridesmaid when they were
married; I was to live with them afterwards; I was to keep all the
keys of their house; I was to be made happy for ever and a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if the suit SHOULD make us rich, Esther--which it may, you
know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard to crown all.

<p/>A shade crossed Ada's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Ada,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>asked Richard, <div class="bookquote">``why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It had better declare us poor at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't know about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, <div class="bookquote">``but at all events,
it won't declare anything at once. It hasn't declared anything in
heaven knows how many years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>urged Richard, answering what her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) look suggested rather
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``the longer it goes on, dear cousin, the nearer it
must be to a settlement one way or other. Now, is not that
reasonable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best, Richard. But I am afraid if we trust to it, it will
make us unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my Ada, we are not going to trust to it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard gaily.
<div class="bookquote">``We know it better than to trust to it. We only say that if it SHOULD
make us rich, we have no constitutional objection to being rich. The
court is, by solemn settlement of law, our grim old guardian, and we
are to suppose that what it gives us -LRB-when it gives us anything-RRB- is
our right. It is not necessary to quarrel with our right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, <div class="bookquote">``but it may be better to forget all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard, <div class="bookquote">``then we will forget all about it! We
consign the whole thing to oblivion. Dame Durden puts on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
approving face, and it's done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dame Durden's approving face,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, looking out of the box in
which I was packing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) books, <div class="bookquote">``was not very visible when you called
it by that name; but it does approve, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thinks you can't do
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>So, Richard said there was an end of it, and immediately began, on no
other foundation, to build as many castles in the air as would man
the Great Wall of China. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) went away in high spirits. Ada and I,
prepared to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) very much, commenced our quieter career.

<p/>On our arrival in London, we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs.
Jellyby's but had not been so fortunate as to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) at home. It
appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken
Miss Jellyby with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>). Besides the tea-drinking, there was to be some
considerable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits
of the cultivation of coffee, conjointly with natives, at the
Settlement of Borrioboola-Gha. All this involved, no doubt,
sufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) daughter's part
in the proceedings anything but a holiday.

<p/>It being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby's return, we
called again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile
End directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising
out of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I
had not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call -LRB-when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was not
to be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) must have
strolled away with the dustman's cart-RRB-, I now inquired for him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) again.
The oyster shells he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had been building a house with were still in the
passage, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that
he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``gone after the sheep.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When we repeated, with some surprise,
<div class="bookquote">``The sheep?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) said, Oh, yes, on market days he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) sometimes followed
them quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was!

<p/>I was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following
morning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss
Jellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt
into corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face and hands and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hair very wet and
then violently frizzling it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) fingers. Everything the dear
child wore was either too large for him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) or too small. Among his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) other
contradictory decorations he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had the hat of a bishop and the little
gloves of a baby. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a
ploughman, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches
that they looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of
plaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different
patterns. The deficient buttons on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) plaid frock had evidently been
supplied from one of Mr. Jellyby's coats, they were so extremely
brazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of
needlework appeared on several parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) dress, where it had been
hastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
was, however, unaccountably improved in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) appearance and looked
very pretty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a
failure after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) trouble, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) showed it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) came in by
the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) glanced first at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) and then at us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``Due east!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada and I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) a cordial welcome and presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) to Mr.
Jarndyce, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) sat down, <div class="bookquote">``Ma's compliments, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hopes you'll excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s correcting proofs of the
plan. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s going to put out five thousand new circulars, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
knows you'll be interested to hear that. I have brought one of them
with me. Ma's compliments.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) presented it sulkily
enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby.
Oh, dear me! This is a very trying wind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peepy</b></font>)</div><p/>We were busy with Peepy, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) clerical hat, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) elbow at first,
but relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
on my lap, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then
withdrawing into the temporary growlery, Miss Jellyby opened a
conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) usual abruptness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
have no peace of my life. Talk of Africa! I couldn't be worse off if
I was a what's-his-name--man and a brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I tried to say something soothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's of no use, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Jellyby, <div class="bookquote">``though
I thank you for the kind intention all the same. I know how I am
used, and I am not to be talked over. YOU wouldn't be talked over if
you were used so. Peepy, go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peepy</b></font>)</div>said Peepy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, you ungrateful, naughty, hard-hearted boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>returned Miss
Jellyby with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never take pains to dress you
any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will go, Caddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peepy</b></font>)</div>cried Peepy, who was really a good child and
who was so moved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) sister's vexation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) went at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems a little thing to cry about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said poor Miss Jellyby
apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``but I am quite worn out. I was directing the new
circulars till two this morning. I detest the whole thing so that
that alone makes my head ache till I can't see out of my eyes. And
look at that poor unfortunate child! Was there ever such a fright as
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>Peepy, happily unconscious of the defects in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) appearance, sat on
the carpet behind one of the legs of the piano, looking calmly out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) den at us while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) cake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to the other end of the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>observed Miss
Jellyby, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) chair nearer ours, <div class="bookquote">``because I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to
hear the conversation. Those little things are so sharp! I was going
to say, we really are going on worse than ever. Pa will be a bankrupt
before long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied. There'll he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nobody
but Ma to thank for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>We said we hoped Mr. Jellyby's affairs were not in so bad a state as
that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's of no use hoping, though it's very kind of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>returned Miss
Jellyby, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Pa told me only yesterday morning -LRB-and
dreadfully unhappy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't weather the storm. I
should be surprised if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could. When all our tradesmen send into our
house any stuff they like, and the servants do what they like with
it, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don't
care about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather
the storm. I declare if I was Pa, I'd run away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Your papa, no doubt, considers his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) family is all very fine, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>replied Miss
Jellyby; <div class="bookquote">``but what comfort is his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) family to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)? His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) family is
nothing but bills, dirt, waste, noise, tumbles downstairs, confusion,
and wretchedness. His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) scrambling home, from week's end to week's end,
is like one great washing-day--only nothing's washed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Jellyby tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) foot upon the floor and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I pity Pa to that degree,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and am so angry with
Ma that I can't find words to express myself! However, I am not going
to bear it, I am determined. I won't be a slave all my life, and I
won't submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale. A pretty thing, indeed,
to marry a philanthropist. As if I hadn't had enough of THAT!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
poor Miss Jellyby.

<p/>I must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs.
Jellyby myself, seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing
how much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it wasn't that we had been intimate when you stopped at our
house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>pursued Miss Jellyby, <div class="bookquote">``I should have been ashamed to come
here to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two. But as
it is, I made up my mind to call, especially as I am not likely to
see you again the next time you come to town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at
one another, foreseeing something more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said Miss Jellyby, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all likely! I know
I may trust you two. I am sure you won't betray me. I am engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without their knowledge at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, good gracious me, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) returned, justifying
herself in a fretful but not angry manner, <div class="bookquote">``how can it be otherwise?
You know what Ma is--and I needn't make poor Pa more miserable by
telling HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But would it not be adding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ma</b></font>) unhappiness to marry without his (<font color='blue'><b>Ma</b></font>)
knowledge or consent, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Miss Jellyby, softening. <div class="bookquote">``I hope not. I should try to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ma</b></font>) happy and comfortable when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ma</b></font>) came to see me, and Peepy and the
others should take it in turns to come and stay with me, and they
should have some care taken of them then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) softened more
and more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little
home-picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had raised in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mind that Peepy, in his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) cave under
the piano, was touched, and turned himself over on his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) back with loud
lamentations. It was not until I had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) sister,
and had restored him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) place on my lap, and had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) that
Caddy was laughing -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) laughed expressly for the purpose-RRB-, that we
could recall his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) peace of mind; even then it was for some time
conditional on his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our
faces all over with his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) hand. At last, as his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) spirits were not equal
to the piano, we put him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) on a chair to look out of window; and Miss
Jellyby, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) by one leg, resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It began in your coming to our house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said.

<p/>We naturally asked how.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt I was so awkward,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that I made up my mind to be
improved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told
Ma I was ashamed of myself, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked
at me in that provoking way of hers as if I wasn't in sight, but I
was quite determined to be taught to dance, and so I went to Mr.
Turveydrop's Academy in Newman Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was it there, my dear--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop.
There are two Mr. Turveydrops, father and son. My Mr. Turveydrop is
the son, of course. I only wish I had been better brought up and was
likely to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) a better wife, for I am very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear this,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I must confess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why you should be sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) retorted a little
anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
is very fond of me. It's a secret as yet, even on his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) side, because
old Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) heart or give him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) some other shock if he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) was told of it abruptly.
Old Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed--very
gentlemanly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) wife know of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>asked Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Mr. Turveydrop's wife, Miss Clare?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jellyby</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Jellyby,
opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``There's no such person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) is a widower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peepy</b></font>)</div><p/>We were here interrupted by Peepy, whose leg had undergone so much on
account of his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) sister's unconsciously jerking it like a bell-rope
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
sufferings with a very low-spirited noise. As he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) appealed to me for
compassion, and as I was only a listener, I undertook to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>).
Miss Jellyby proceeded, after begging Peepy's pardon with a kiss and
assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) hadn't meant to do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the state of the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``If I ever blame myself,
I still think it's Ma's fault. We are to be married whenever we can,
and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won't
much agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy with a sob, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall never hear of Africa after I am
married. Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr.
Turveydrop knows there is such a place, it's as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) who was very gentlemanly, I think!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very gentlemanly indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) is celebrated almost
everywhere for his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) deportment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) teach?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>asked Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) don't teach anything in particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``But his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
deportment is beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Caddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that
there was one thing more she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) wished us to know, and felt we ought to
know, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hoped would not offend us. It was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had
improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) acquaintance with Miss Flite, the little crazy old lady,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) frequently went there early in the morning and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
lover for a few minutes before breakfast--only for a few minutes. <div class="bookquote">``I
go there at other times,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``but Prince does not come then.
Young Mr. Turveydrop's name is Prince; I wish it wasn't, because it
sounds like a dog, but of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) didn't christen himself. Old Mr.
Turveydrop had him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince
Regent. Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
deportment. I hope you won't think the worse of me for having made
these little appointments at Miss Flite's, where I first went with
you, because I like the poor thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own sake and I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
likes me. If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop, I am sure you would
think well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)--at least, I am sure you couldn't possibly think
any ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>). I am going there now for my lesson. I couldn't ask
you to go with me, Miss Summerson; but if you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, who
had said all this earnestly and tremblingly, <div class="bookquote">``I should be very
glad--very glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss
Flite's that day. We had told him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) of our former visit, and our
account had interested him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); but something had always happened to
prevent our going there again. As I trusted that I might have
sufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) taking any very
rash step if I fully accepted the confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was so willing to
place in me, poor girl, I proposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) and I and Peepy should go
to the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss
Flite's, whose name I now learnt for the first time. This was on
condition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to
dinner. The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to
by both, we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few
pins, some soap and water, and a hair-brush, and went out, bending
our steps towards Newman Street, which was very near.

<p/>I found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the
corner of an archway, with busts in all the staircase windows. In the
same house there were also established, as I gathered from the plates
on the door, a drawing-master, a coal-merchant -LRB-there was, certainly,
no room for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) coals-RRB-, and a lithographic artist. On the plate
which, in size and situation, took precedence of all the rest, I
read, MR. TURVEYDROP. The door was open, and the hall was blocked up
by a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in
cases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the
daylight. Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent,
last night, for a concert.

<p/>We went upstairs--it had been quite a fine house once, when it was
anybody's business to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody's business
to smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop's great room, which
was built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight.
It was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms
along the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with
painted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, which seemed
to be shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed
autumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or
fourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; and
I was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy, pinching my
arm, repeated the ceremony of introduction. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson, Mr.
Prince Turveydrop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with
flaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a little fiddle, which we used to call at school a
kit, under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left arm, and its little bow in the same hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
little dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a
little innocent, feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an
amiable way, but made this singular effect upon me, that I received
the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother had
not been much considered or well used.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby's friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, bowing low
to me. <div class="bookquote">``I began to fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with timid tenderness, <div class="bookquote">``as it was past the
usual time, that Miss Jellyby was not coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me, who have
detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), and to receive my excuses, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I entreated, <div class="bookquote">``do not allow me to be the cause of any more
delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>With that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy -LRB-who, being well
used to it, had already climbed into a corner place-RRB- and an old lady
of a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and
who was very indignant with Peepy's boots. Prince Turveydrop then
tinkled the strings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) kit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) fingers, and the young ladies
stood up to dance. Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr.
Turveydrop, in the full lustre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) deportment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion, false teeth,
false whiskers, and a wig. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had a fur collar, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had a padded
breast to his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) coat, which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon
to be complete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) was pinched in, and swelled out, and got up, and
strapped down, as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) could possibly bear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had such a
neckcloth on -LRB-puffing his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) very eyes out of their natural shape-RRB-, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) chin and even his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) ears so sunk into it, that it seemed as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) must inevitably double up if it were cast loose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had under his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
arm a hat of great size and weight, shelving downward from the crown
to the brim, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) hand a pair of white gloves with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
flapped it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered,
round-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had a cane,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had an eye-glass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had a snuff-box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had rings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had
wristbands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had everything but any touch of nature; he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) was not
like youth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) was not like age, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) was not like anything in the
world but a model of deportment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father! A visitor. Miss Jellyby's friend, Miss Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Distinguished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``by Miss Summerson's presence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) bowed to me in that tight state, I almost believe I saw creases
come into the whites of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, aside, to me with quite an affecting
belief in him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is a celebrated character. My father is greatly
admired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, Prince! Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) back
to the fire and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) gloves condescendingly. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, my son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At this command, or by this gracious permission, the lesson went on.
Prince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played
the piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little
breath he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) could spare, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) set a pupil right; always
conscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step
and every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant. His (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
distinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire,
a model of deportment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) never does anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady of the
censorious countenance. <div class="bookquote">``Yet would you believe that it's HIS (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name on
the door-plate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son's name is the same, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wouldn't let his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son have any name if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could take it from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``Look at the son's dress!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It certainly was
plain--threadbare--almost shabby. <div class="bookquote">``Yet the father must be garnished
and tricked out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, <div class="bookquote">``because of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deportment. I'd
deport him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! Transport him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be better!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt curious to know more concerning this person. I asked, <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
give lessons in deportment now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>returned the old lady shortly. <div class="bookquote">``Never did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's consideration, I suggested that perhaps fencing had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) accomplishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can fence at all, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/>I looked surprised and inquisitive. The old lady, becoming more and
more incensed against the master of deportment as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dwelt upon the
subject, gave me some particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) career, with strong
assurances that they were mildly stated.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had married a meek little dancing-mistress, with a tolerable
connexion -LRB-having never in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) life before done anything but deport
himself-RRB-, and had worked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to death, or had, at the best, suffered
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to work herself to death, to maintain him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in those expenses which
were indispensable to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) position. At once to exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) deportment
to the best models and to keep the best models constantly before
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had found it necessary to frequent all public places of
fashionable and lounging resort, to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere
at fashionable times, and to lead an idle life in the very best
clothes. To enable him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to do this, the affectionate little
dancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and
laboured to that hour if her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) strength had lasted so long. For the
mainspring of the story was that in spite of the man's absorbing
selfishness, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife -LRB-overpowered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deportment-RRB- had, to the
last, believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and had, on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death-bed, in the most moving
terms, confided him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to their son as one who had an inextinguishable
claim upon him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could never regard with too much pride and
deference. The son, inheriting his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother's belief, and having the
deportment always before him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), had lived and grown in the same faith,
and now, at thirty years of age, worked for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father twelve hours a
day and looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with veneration on the old imaginary
pinnacle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The airs the fellow gives himself!''  (<font color='red'><b>informant</b></font>)</div>said my informant, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
head at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) drew on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
rendering. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fully believes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is one of the aristocracy! And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is
so condescending to the son he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so egregiously deludes that you might
suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the most virtuous of parents. Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady,
apostrophizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) with infinite vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``I could bite you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with
feelings of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with the
father and son before me. What I might have thought of them without
the old lady's account, or what I might have thought of the old
lady's account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of
things in the whole that carried conviction with it.

<p/>My eyes were yet wandering, from young Mr. Turveydrop working so
hard, to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully, when
the latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a
distinction on London by residing in it? I did not think it necessary
to reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any
case, but merely told him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) where I did reside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A lady so graceful and accomplished,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) said, kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
right glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils,
<div class="bookquote">``will look leniently on the deficiencies here. We do our best to
polish--polish--polish!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the pupils</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) sat down beside me, taking some pains to sit on the form, I
thought, in imitation of the print of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) illustrious model on the
sofa. And really he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) did look very like it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To polish--polish--polish!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and
gently fluttering his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``But we are not, if I may say so to
one formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with the
high-shouldered bow, which it seemed impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) to make
without lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) eyebrows and shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) eyes <div class="bookquote">''--we are not
what we used to be in point of deportment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we not, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have degenerated,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) returned, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) head, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) could
do to a very limited extent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) cravat. ``A levelling age is not
favourable to deportment. It develops vulgarity. Perhaps I speak with
some little partiality. It may not be for me to say that I have been
called, for some years now, Gentleman Turveydrop, or that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentleman</b></font>) Royal
Highness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire, on my
removing my hat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton -LRB-that
fine building-RRB-, ``Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>)? Who the devil is he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)? Why don't I know
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)? Why hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thirty thousand a year?<div class="bookquote">'' But these are little
matters of anecdote--the general property, ma'am--still repeated
occasionally among the upper classes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) replied with the high-shouldered bow. <div class="bookquote">``Where what is left among us
of deportment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``still lingers. England--alas, my
country!--has degenerated very much, and is degenerating every day.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) has not many gentlemen left. We are few. I see nothing to succeed
us but a race of weavers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) smiled with a high-shouldered bow again. <div class="bookquote">``You
flatter me. But, no--no! I have never been able to imbue my poor boy
with that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) art. Heaven forbid that I should disparage my
dear child, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has--no deportment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) appears to be an excellent master,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Understand me, my dear madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) IS an excellent master. All that
can be acquired, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has acquired. All that can be imparted, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can
impart. But there ARE things--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) took another pinch of snuff and
made the bow again, as if to add, <div class="bookquote">``This kind of thing, for instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>I glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby's lover,
now engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than
ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My amiable child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>murmured Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) cravat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your son is indefatigable,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my reward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``to hear you say so. In some
respects, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) treads in the footsteps of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sainted mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a
devoted creature. But wooman, lovely wooman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop
with very disagreeable gallantry, <div class="bookquote">``what a sex you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>I rose and joined Miss Jellyby, who was by this time putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
bonnet. The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was
a general putting on of bonnets. When Miss Jellyby and the
unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I don't
know, but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a
dozen words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``do you know the
hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father.''  (<font color='red'><b>The son</b></font>)</div>The son had no watch. The father had a handsome gold
one, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it's two o'clock. Recollect your school at
Kensington at three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's time enough for me, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>said Prince. <div class="bookquote">``I can take a
morsel of dinner standing and be off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``you must be very quick. You will
find the cold mutton on the table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, father. Are YOU off now, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear. I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) eyes and
lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) shoulders with modest consciousness, <div class="bookquote">``that I must show
myself, as usual, about town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better dine out comfortably somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at
the French house, in the Opera Colonnade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right. Good-bye, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>said Prince, shaking hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my son. Bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son good, who, in parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), was so pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), so
dutiful to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and so proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that I almost felt as if it were
an unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly
in the elder. The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking
leave of us -LRB-and particularly of one of us, as I saw, being in the
secret-RRB-, enhanced my favourable impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) almost childish
character. I felt a liking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and a compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) little kit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pocket--and with it his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) desire to stay a little
while with Caddy--and went away good-humouredly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cold mutton
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) school at Kensington, that made me scarcely less irate with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father than the censorious old lady.

<p/>The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner,
I must acknowledge, worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shining original. In the same style
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) presently passed us on the other side of the street, on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way to
the aristocratic part of the town, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to show himself
among the few other gentlemen left. For some moments, I was so lost
in reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I
was quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to me, especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether
there were, or ever had been, any other gentlemen, not in the dancing
profession, who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their
deportment. This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility
of so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, you must make up
your mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
accordingly did so, and we chatted all the rest of the way to
Lincoln's Inn.

<p/>Caddy told me that her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lover's education had been so neglected that
it was not always easy to read his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) notes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were not so
anxious about his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) spelling and took less pains to make it clear, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
would do better; but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) put so many unnecessary letters into short
words that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
does it with the best intention,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``but it hasn't the
effect he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) means, poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Caddy then went on to reason, how
could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) be expected to be a scholar when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) whole
life in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag,
fag and teach, morning, noon, and night! And what did it matter? She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
could write letters enough for both, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cost, and it
was far better for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to be amiable than learned. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, it's not
as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself
airs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy. ``I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's another thing I want to tell you, now we are alone,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``which I should not have liked to mention unless you
had seen Prince, Miss Summerson. You know what a house ours is. It's
of no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for
Prince's wife to know in OUR house. We live in such a state of muddle
that it's impossible, and I have only been more disheartened whenever
I have tried. So I get a little practice with--who do you think? Poor
Miss Flite! Early in the morning I help her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to tidy her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room and
clean her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) birds, and I make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cup of coffee for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) -LRB-of course she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
taught me-RRB-, and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says
it's the very best coffee he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ever tasted, and would quite delight old
Mr. Turveydrop, who is very particular indeed about his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) coffee. I can
make little puddings too; and I know how to buy neck of mutton, and
tea, and sugar, and butter, and a good many housekeeping things. I am
not clever at my needle, yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peepy</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, glancing at the repairs on
Peepy's frock, <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps I shall improve, and since I have been
engaged to Prince and have been doing all this, I have felt
better-tempered, I hope, and more forgiving to Ma. It rather put me
out at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat
and pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too, but on the
whole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to
Ma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peepy</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor girl, trying so hard, said it from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart, and touched
mine. <div class="bookquote">``Caddy, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, <div class="bookquote">``I begin to have a great affection
for you, and I hope we shall become friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``How happy that would make me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``let us be friends from this time, and let
us often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right
way through them.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in
my old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and I would not
have objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller
consideration than a settlement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) daughter-in-law.

<p/>By this time we were come to Mr. Krook's, whose private door stood
open. There was a bill, pasted on the door-post, announcing a room to
let on the second floor. It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded
upstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and
that our little friend had been ill of the fright. The door and
window of the vacant room being open, we looked in. It was the room
with the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my
attention when I was last in the house. A sad and desolate place it
was, a gloomy, sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of
mournfulness and even dread. <div class="bookquote">``You look pale,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Caddy when we came
out, <div class="bookquote">``and cold!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt as if the room had chilled me.

<p/>We had walked slowly while we were talking, and my guardian and Ada
were here before us. We found them in Miss Flite's garret. They were
looking at the birds, while a medical gentleman who was so good as to
attend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
cheerfully by the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have finished my professional visit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, coming forward.
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court -LRB-as her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) mind is
set upon it-RRB- to-morrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) has been greatly missed there, I
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a
general curtsy to us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Honoured, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``by another visit from the wards in
Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my
humble roof!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with a special curtsy. <div class="bookquote">``Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
had bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
by it--<div class="bookquote">``a double welcome!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) been very ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we
had found in attendance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) answered for herself directly,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had put the question in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, decidedly unwell! Oh, very unwell indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said
confidentially. <div class="bookquote">``Not pain, you know--trouble. Not bodily so much as
nervous, nervous! The truth is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a subdued voice and trembling,
<div class="bookquote">``we have had death here. There was poison in the house. I am very
susceptible to such horrid things. It frightened me. Only Mr.
Woodcourt knows how much. My physician, Mr. Woodcourt!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with
great stateliness. <div class="bookquote">``The wards in Jarndyce--Jarndyce of Bleak
House--Fitz-Jarndyce!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Flite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
were appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) while speaking to us, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) hand
gently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Flite describes her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) illness with her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) usual
accuracy. She (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might
have alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and
agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery,
though too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I
have compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since
and being of some small use to her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The kindest physician in the college,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>whispered Miss Flite to me.
<div class="bookquote">``I expect a judgment. On the day of judgment. And shall then confer
estates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) will be as well in a day or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt, looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) with an observant smile, <div class="bookquote">``as she (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) ever will be. In other words,
quite well of course. Have you heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) good fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most extraordinary!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite, smiling brightly. <div class="bookquote">``You never
heard of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or
Guppy -LRB-clerk to Conversation K.-RRB- places in my hand a paper of
shillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in the
paper. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So
well-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you
say? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I
think? I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite, drawing herself back with a very
shrewd look and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) right forefinger in a most significant
manner, <div class="bookquote">``that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during
which the Great Seal has been open -LRB-for it has been open a long
time!-RRB-, forwards them. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now
that's very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) IS a
little slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other
day--I attend it regularly, with my documents--I taxed him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) with it,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) almost confessed. That is, I smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) from my bench, and
HE (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) smiled at me from his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) bench. But it's great good fortune, is it
not? And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage.
Oh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) addressed herself to me-RRB- upon this
fortunate addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) income and wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) a long continuance of
it. I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder
whose humanity was so considerate. My guardian stood before me,
contemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you call these little fellows, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
pleasant voice. <div class="bookquote">``Have they any names?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can answer for Miss Flite that they have,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
promised to tell us what they were. Ada remembers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada remembered very well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite. <div class="bookquote">``Who's that at my door? What are you
listening at my door for, Krook?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man of the house, pushing it open before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), appeared there
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fur cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cat at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I warn't listening, Miss Flite,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I was going to give a rap
with my knuckles, only you're so quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make your cat go down. Drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) away!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the old lady angrily
exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah, bah! There ain't no danger, gentlefolks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Krook,
looking slowly and sharply from one to another until he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) had looked at
all of us; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)'d never offer at the birds when I was here unless I
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will excuse my landlord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady with a dignified
air. <div class="bookquote">``M, quite M! What do you want, Krook, when I have company?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``You know I am the Chancellor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Flite. <div class="bookquote">``What of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the Chancellor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man with a chuckle, <div class="bookquote">``not to be
acquainted with a Jarndyce is queer, ain't it, Miss Flite? Mightn't I
take the liberty? Your servant, sir. I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce
a`most as well as you do, sir. I knowed old Squire Tom, sir. I never
to my knowledge see you afore though, not even in court. Yet, I go
there a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one
day with another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never go there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) never did on any
consideration-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``I would sooner go--somewhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>returned Krook, grinning. <div class="bookquote">``You're bearing hard
upon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, sir, though
perhaps it is but nat`ral in a Jarndyce. The burnt child, sir! What,
you're looking at my lodger's birds, Mr. Jarndyce?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man had
come by little and little into the room until he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) now touched my
guardian with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) elbow and looked close up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
spectacled eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It's one of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) strange ways that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll never tell
the names of these birds if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can help it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) named 'em
all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I run 'em over, Flite?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) asked
aloud, winking at us and pointing at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned away,
affecting to sweep the grate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered hurriedly.

<p/>The old man, looking up at the cages after another look at us, went
through the list.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin,
Despair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags,
Sheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach. That's
the whole collection,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, <div class="bookquote">``all cooped up together, by
my noble and learned brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a bitter wind!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>muttered my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When my noble and learned brother gives his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) judgment, they're to be
let go free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>said Krook, winking at us again. <div class="bookquote">``And then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) added,
whispering and grinning, <div class="bookquote">``if that ever was to happen--which it
won't--the birds that have never been caged would kill 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If ever the wind was in the east,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, pretending to
look out of the window for a weathercock, <div class="bookquote">``I think it's there
to-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>We found it very difficult to get away from the house. It was not
Miss Flite who detained us; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was as reasonable a little creature
in consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be.
It was Mr. Krook. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) seemed unable to detach himself from Mr.
Jarndyce. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had been linked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) could hardly have attended
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) more closely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) proposed to show us his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) Court of Chancery and
all the strange medley it contained; during the whole of our
inspection -LRB-prolonged by himself-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and
sometimes detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) under one pretence or other until we had
passed on, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) were tormented by an inclination to enter upon
some secret subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) could not make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) mind to approach.
I cannot imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive
of caution and indecision, and a perpetual impulse to do something he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
could not resolve to venture on, than Mr. Krook's was that day. His (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
watchfulness of my guardian was incessant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) rarely removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) eyes
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) face. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) went on beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) with the
slyness of an old white fox. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) went before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) looked back. When
we stood still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) got opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>), and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) hand across
and across his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of
power, and turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) eyes, and lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) grey eyebrows until
they appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) face.

<p/>At last, having been -LRB-always attended by the cat-RRB- all over the house
and having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was
certainly curious, we came into the back part of the shop. Here on
the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle, some old
stumps of pens, and some dirty playbills; and against the wall were
pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>asked my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trying to learn myself to read and write,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>said Krook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you get on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Slow. Bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the old man impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``It's hard at my time
of life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be easier to be taught by some one,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, but they might teach me wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the old man with a
wonderfully suspicious flash of his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I may
have lost by not being learned afore. I wouldn't like to lose
anything by being learned wrong now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) good-humoured smile. <div class="bookquote">``Who do you
suppose would teach you wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the old man,
turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) spectacles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) forehead and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't suppose as anybody would, but I'd rather trust my own self than
another!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>These answers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) manner were strange enough to cause my guardian
to inquire of Mr. Woodcourt, as we all walked across Lincoln's Inn
together, whether Mr. Krook were really, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) lodger represented
him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>), deranged. The young surgeon replied, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had seen no reason
to think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually
was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was always more or less under the influence of raw gin,
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) drank great quantities and of which he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) back-shop,
as we might have observed, smelt strongly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) did not think him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
mad as yet.

<p/>On our way home, I so conciliated Peepy's affections by buying him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) a
windmill and two flour-sacks that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) would suffer nobody else to take
off his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my
side. Caddy sat upon the other side of me, next to Ada, to whom we
imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back.
We made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened
exceedingly; and my guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all
very happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach,
with Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill.

<p/>I have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Mr.
Woodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr.
Badger's. Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to dinner that day. Or
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) came. Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada,
<div class="bookquote">``Now, my darling, let us have a little talk about Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>Ada
laughed and said--

<p/>But I don't think it matters what my darling said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was always
merry.




<p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/>Bell Yard


<p/>While we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the
crowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much
astonished us. Mr. Quale, who presented himself soon after our
arrival, was in all such excitements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) seemed to project those two
shining knobs of temples of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) into everything that went on and to
brush his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) hair farther and farther back, until the very roots were
almost ready to fly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) head in inappeasable philanthropy. All
objects were alike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) was always particularly ready for
anything in the way of a testimonial to any one. His (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) great power
seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) power of indiscriminate admiration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) would sit for
any length of time, with the utmost enjoyment, bathing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) temples in
the light of any order of luminary. Having first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) perfectly
swallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby, I had supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) to be
the absorbing object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) devotion. I soon discovered my mistake
and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) to be train-bearer and organ-blower to a whole
procession of people.

<p/>Mrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something, and with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>), Mr. Quale. Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to
us; and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) drew Mrs. Pardiggle
out. Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in
behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) eloquent friend Mr. Gusher. With Mr. Gusher appeared
Mr. Quale again. Mr. Gusher, being a flabby gentleman with a moist
surface and eyes so much too small for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gusher</b></font>) moon of a face that they
seemed to have been originally made for somebody else, was not at
first sight prepossessing; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gusher</b></font>) was scarcely seated before Mr.
Quale asked Ada and me, not inaudibly, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) was not a great
creature--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) certainly was, flabbily speaking, though Mr. Quale
meant in intellectual beauty--and whether we were not struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>)
massive configuration of brow. In short, we heard of a great many
missions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing
respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale's
mission to be in ecstasies with everybody else's mission and that it
was the most popular mission of all.

<p/>Mr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
heart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) earnest desire to do all the good in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) power; but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company, where
benevolence took spasmodic forms, where charity was assumed as a
regular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap
notoriety, vehement in profession, restless and vain in action,
servile in the last degree of meanness to the great, adulatory of one
another, and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help
the weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and
self-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
plainly told us. When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by
Mr. Gusher -LRB-who had already got one, originated by Mr. Quale-RRB-, and
when Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a
meeting, including two charity schools of small boys and girls, who
were specially reminded of the widow's mite, and requested to come
forward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices, I think the wind
was in the east for three whole weeks.

<p/>I mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again. It seemed
to me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) off-hand professions of childishness and carelessness
were a great relief to my guardian, by contrast with such things, and
were the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly
undesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasure. I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole
divined this and was politic; I really never understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) well
enough to know. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was to my guardian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) certainly was to the
rest of the world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had not been very well; and thus, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) lived in London, we
had seen nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) until now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) appeared one morning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
usual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever.

<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was! He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been bilious, but rich men were
often bilious, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been persuading himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
was a man of property. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was, in a certain point of view--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
expansive intentions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been enriching his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) medical attendant in
the most lavish manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had always doubled, and sometimes
quadrupled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) fees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had said to the doctor, <div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear
doctor, it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you
attend me for nothing. I am overwhelming you with money--in my
expansive intentions--if you only knew it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>And really -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
meant it to that degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) thought it much the same as doing it.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind
attached so much importance to put in the doctor's hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would
have put them in the doctor's hand. Not having them, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) substituted
the will for the deed. Very well! If he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) really meant it--if his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will
were genuine and real, which it was--it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) that it was
the same as coin, and cancelled the obligation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be, partly, because I know nothing of the value of money,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, ``but I often feel this. It seems so reasonable! My
butcher says to me he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) wants that little bill. It's a part of the
pleasant unconscious poetry of the man's nature that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always calls
it a `little' bill--to make the payment appear easy to both of us. I
reply to the butcher, <div class="bookquote">``My good friend, if you knew it, you are paid.
You haven't had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill. You
are paid. I mean it.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had meant the meat in
the bill, instead of providing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) returned, ``you surprise me. You take the
butcher's position. A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very
ground. Says he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>), ``Sir, why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence
a pound?'' ``Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound, my
honest friend?'' said I, naturally amazed by the question. ``I like
spring lamb!'' This was so far convincing. ``Well, sir,'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), ``I
wish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money!'' ``My good fellow,<div class="bookquote">''
said I, `pray let us reason like intellectual beings. How could that
be? It was impossible. You HAD got the lamb, and I have NOT got the
money. You couldn't really mean the lamb without sending it in,
whereas I can, and do, really mean the money without paying it!''  (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
had not a word. There was an end of the subject.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) take no legal proceedings?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>inquired my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) took legal proceedings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``But in that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
was influenced by passion, not by reason. Passion reminds me of
Boythorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) writes me that you and the ladies have promised him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a
short visit at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) bachelor-house in Lincolnshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a great favourite with my girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``and I
have promised for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nature forgot to shade him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) off, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Skimpole to
Ada and me. <div class="bookquote">``A little too boisterous--like the sea. A little too
vehement--like a bull who has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mind to consider every
colour scarlet. But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I should have been surprised if those two could have thought very
highly of one another, Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to
many things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything. Besides
which, I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of
breaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred
to. Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly
pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has invited me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole; <div class="bookquote">``and if a child may trust
himself in such hands--which the present child is encouraged to do,
with the united tenderness of two angels to guard him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)--I shall go. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
proposes to frank me down and back again. I suppose it will cost
money? Shillings perhaps? Or pounds? Or something of that sort? By
the by, Coavinses. You remember our friend Coavinses, Miss
Summerson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) asked me as the subject arose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) mind, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) graceful,
light-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coavinses has been arrested by the Great Bailiff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>) will never do violence to the sunshine any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It quite shocked me to hear it, for I had already recalled with
anything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on
the sofa that night wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>) successor informed me of it yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. ``His (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>)
successor is in my house now--in possession, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>) calls it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>)
came yesterday, on my blue-eyed daughter's birthday. I put it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>),
``This is unreasonable and inconvenient. If you had a blue-eyed
daughter you wouldn't like ME to come, uninvited, on HER birthday?<div class="bookquote">''
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) stayed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched
the piano by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was seated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>) told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, playing little chords where I shall put
full stops, <div class="bookquote">``The Coavinses had left. Three children. No mother. And
that Coavinses' profession. Being unpopular. The rising Coavinses.
Were at a considerable disadvantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce got up, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head, and began to walk about. Mr.
Skimpole played the melody of one of Ada's favourite songs. Ada and I
both looked at Mr. Jarndyce, thinking that we knew what was passing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) mind.

<p/>After walking and stopping, and several times leaving off rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
head, and beginning again, my guardian put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hand upon the keys and
stopped Mr. Skimpole's playing. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like this, Skimpole,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
said thoughtfully.

<p/>Mr. Skimpole, who had quite forgotten the subject, looked up
surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man was necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>pursued my guardian, walking backward and
forward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the
room and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) hair up from the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head as if a high
east wind had blown it into that form. <div class="bookquote">``If we make such men necessary
by our faults and follies, or by our want of worldly knowledge, or by
our misfortunes, we must not revenge ourselves upon them. There was
no harm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) trade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) maintained his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) children. One would like to
know more about this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Coavinses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Skimpole, at length perceiving what he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
meant. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing easier. A walk to Coavinses' headquarters, and you
can know what you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce nodded to us, who were only waiting for the signal.
<div class="bookquote">``Come! We will walk that way, my dears. Why not that way as soon as
another!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We were quickly ready and went out. Mr. Skimpole went with
us and quite enjoyed the expedition. It was so new and so refreshing,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) took us, first, to Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, where there was
a house with barred windows, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) called Coavinses' Castle. On
our going into the entry and ringing a bell, a very hideous boy came
out of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who did you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, fitting two of the spikes into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a follower, or an officer, or something, here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``who is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. <div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to know his (<font color='blue'><b>follower</b></font>) name, if you please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Name of Neckett,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>follower</b></font>) address?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bell Yard,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. <div class="bookquote">``Chandler's shop, left hand side, name of
Blinder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)--I don't know how to shape the question--''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>murmured my
guardian, <div class="bookquote">``industrious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Neckett?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, wery much so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) was never tired
of watching. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)'d set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten
hours at a stretch if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) undertook to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) might have done worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard my guardian soliloquize. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)
might have undertaken to do it and not done it. Thank you. That's all
I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>We left the boy, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head on one side and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms on the gate,
fondling and sucking the spikes, and went back to Lincoln's Inn,
where Mr. Skimpole, who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses,
awaited us. Then we all went to Bell Yard, a narrow alley at a very
short distance. We soon found the chandler's shop. In it was a
good-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy, or an asthma, or
perhaps both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neckett's children?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in reply to my inquiry. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Surely,
miss. Three pair, if you please. Door right opposite the stairs.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) handed me the key across the counter.

<p/>I glanced at the key and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took it for granted
that I knew what to do with it. As it could only be intended for the
children's door, I came out without asking any more questions and led
the way up the dark stairs. We went as quietly as we could, but four
of us made some noise on the aged boards, and when we came to the
second story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there
looking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Gridley that's wanted?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes on me with an
angry stare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``I am going higher up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at Ada, and at Mr. Jarndyce, and at Mr. Skimpole, fixing
the same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and
followed me. Mr. Jarndyce gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) good day. <div class="bookquote">``Good day!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said
abruptly and fiercely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was a tall, sallow man with a careworn head
on which but little hair remained, a deeply lined face, and prominent
eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had a combative look and a chafing, irritable manner which,
associated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) figure--still large and powerful, though
evidently in its decline--rather alarmed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had a pen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
hand, and in the glimpse I caught of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) room in passing, I saw that
it was covered with a litter of papers.

<p/>Leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) standing there, we went up to the top room. I tapped at
the door, and a little shrill voice inside said, <div class="bookquote">``We are locked in.
Mrs. Blinder's got the key!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door. In a poor room
with a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a
mite of a boy, some five or six years old, nursing and hushing a
heavy child of eighteen months. There was no fire, though the weather
was cold; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets
as a substitute. Their clothing was not so warm, however, but that
their noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken
as the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its
head on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has locked you up here alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>we naturally asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, standing still to gaze at us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Charley your brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>)'s my sister, Charlotte. Father called her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there any more of you besides Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, <div class="bookquote">``and Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>patting the limp bonnet of the child
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was nursing. <div class="bookquote">``And Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Charley now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out a-washing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, beginning to walk up and down again
and taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to
gaze at us at the same time.

<p/>We were looking at one another and at these two children when there
came into the room a very little girl, childish in figure but shrewd
and older-looking in the face--pretty-faced too--wearing a womanly
sort of bonnet much too large for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and drying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bare arms on a
womanly sort of apron. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers were white and wrinkled with
washing, and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wiped off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
arms. But for this, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have been a child playing at washing
and imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the
truth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had
made all the haste she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could. Consequently, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very
light, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was out of breath and could not speak at first, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
stood panting, and wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms, and looking quietly at us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here's Charley!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/>The child he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be
taken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of
manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us
over the burden that clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) most affectionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the
little creature and got her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to sit down with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) load, the boy
keeping close to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), holding to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) apron, <div class="bookquote">``that this child works
for the rest? Look at this! For God's sake, look at this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a thing to look at. The three children close together, and two
of them relying solely on the third, and the third so young and yet
with an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the
childish figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley, Charley!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``How old are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Over thirteen, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! What a great age,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``What a great age,
Charley!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I cannot describe the tenderness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), half
playfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my
guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>returned the child, looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face with perfect
confidence, <div class="bookquote">``since father died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you live, Charley? Oh! Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian,
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face away for a moment, <div class="bookquote">``how do you live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since father died, sir, I've gone out to work. I'm out washing
to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God help you, Charley!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``You're not tall enough to
reach the tub!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In pattens I am, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I've got a high pair as
belonged to mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when did mother die? Poor mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother died just after Emma was born,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, glancing at
the face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bosom. <div class="bookquote">``Then father said I was to be as good a
mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as I could. And so I tried. And so I worked at home and
did cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began
to go out. And that's how I know how; don't you see, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you often go out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As often as I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes and smiling,
<div class="bookquote">``because of earning sixpences and shillings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To keep 'em safe, sir, don't you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Blinder
comes up now and then, and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and
perhaps I can run in sometimes, and they can play you know, and Tom
an't afraid of being locked up, are you, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No-o!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Tom stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When it comes on dark, the lamps are lighted down in the court, and
they show up here quite bright--almost quite bright. Don't they,
Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``almost quite bright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'s as good as gold,''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>said the little creature--Oh, in such a
motherly, womanly way! <div class="bookquote">``And when Emma's tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to bed.
And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'s tired he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) goes to bed himself. And when I come home and
light the candle and has a bit of supper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) sits up again and has it
with me. Don't you, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Charley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``That I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>And either in this glimpse
of the great pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life or in gratitude and love for
Charley, who was all in all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) face among the scanty
folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) frock and passed from laughing into crying.

<p/>It was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among
these children. The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and
their mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of
taking courage, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) childish importance in being able to work,
and by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bustling busy way. But now, when Tom cried, although she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sat quite tranquil, looking quietly at us, and did not by any
movement disturb a hair of the head of either of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little charges,
I saw two silent tears fall down her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face.

<p/>I stood at the window with Ada, pretending to look at the housetops,
and the blackened stack of chimneys, and the poor plants, and the
birds in little cages belonging to the neighbours, when I found that
Mrs. Blinder, from the shop below, had come in -LRB-perhaps it had taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) all this time to get upstairs-RRB- and was talking to my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not much to forgive 'em the rent, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``who could
take it from them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian to us two. <div class="bookquote">``It is enough that the time
will come when this good woman will find that it WAS much, and that
forasmuch as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did it unto the least of these--This child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>)
added after a few moments, <div class="bookquote">``could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) possibly continue this?''

heavy breath by painful degrees. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s as handy as it's possible to
be. Bless you, sir, the way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tended them two children after the
mother died was the talk of the yard! And it was a wonder to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was took ill, it really was! ``Mrs. Blinder,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>)
said to me the very last he (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) spoke--he (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) was lying there--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blinder/Blinder</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Blinder, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was nothing but a follerers.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) first came to lodge here, I didn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was, and I
confess that when I found out I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) notice. It wasn't liked in
the yard. It wasn't approved by the other lodgers. It is NOT a
genteel calling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blinder/Blinder</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Blinder, <div class="bookquote">``and most people do object to
it. Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) is a good lodger,

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blinder/Blinder</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) notice?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blinder/Blinder</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Blinder. <div class="bookquote">``But really when the time
came, and I knew no other ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>), I was in doubts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) was

Blinder, unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) eye, <div class="bookquote">``and it's
something in this world even to do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I said that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) could arrange with Mr. Gridley, I could
arrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its
being liked or disliked in the yard. Mr. Gridley gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) consent
gruff--but gave it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) was always gruff with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) has been
kind to the children since. A person is never known till a person is
proved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have many people been kind to the children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon the whole, not so bad, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blinder/Blinder</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Blinder; <div class="bookquote">``but certainly
not so many as would have been if their father's calling had been
different. Mr. Coavins gave a guinea, and the follerers made up a
little purse. Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and
tapped their shoulders when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) went by came forward with a little
subscription, and--in general--not so bad. Similarly with Charlotte.
Some people won't employ her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was a follerer's child; some
people that do employ her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cast it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); some make a merit of having
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to work for them, with that and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) draw-backs upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and
perhaps pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) less and put upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) more. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s patienter than
others would be, and is clever too, and always willing, up to the
full mark of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) strength and over. So I should say, in general, not
so bad, sir, but might be better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blinder/Blinder</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity
of recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) breath, exhausted anew by so much talking before it
was fully restored. Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
attention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the
Mr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way
up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you may be doing here, ladies and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>)
said, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) resented our presence, <div class="bookquote">``but you'll excuse my coming
in. I don't come in to stare about me. Well, Charley! Well, Tom!
Well, little one! How is it with us all to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as
a friend by the children, though his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face retained its stern
character and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) manner to us was as rude as it could be. My
guardian noticed it and respected it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one, surely, would come here to stare about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said mildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May be so, sir, may be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>returned the other, taking Tom upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
knee and waving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) off impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to argue with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have sufficient reason, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``for

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man, becoming violently angry. <div class="bookquote">``I am of

renewed violence, <div class="bookquote">``I have been dragged for five and twenty years over
burning iron, and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet. Go
into the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing
jokes that brighten up their business sometimes, and they will tell
you that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire. I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, beating one hand on the other passionately, <div class="bookquote">``am the man from
Shropshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing
some entertainment in the same grave place,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian
composedly. <div class="bookquote">``You may have heard my name--Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gridley/Mr. Gridley</b></font>)</div>said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation, <div class="bookquote">``you
bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine. More than that, I
tell you--and I tell this gentleman, and these young ladies, if they
are friends of yours--that if I took my wrongs in any other way, I
should be driven mad! It is only by resenting them, and by revenging
them in my mind, and by angrily demanding the justice I never get,
that I am able to keep my wits together. It is only that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gridley/Mr. Gridley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) said,
speaking in a homely, rustic way and with great vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``You may
tell me that I over-excite myself. I answer that it's in my nature to
do it, under wrong, and I must do it. There's nothing between doing
it, and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman
that haunts the court. If I was once to sit down under it, I should
become imbecile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The passion and heat in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) was, and the manner in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>)
face worked, and the violent gestures with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) accompanied what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) said, were most painful to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``consider my case. As true as there is a
heaven above us, this is my case. I am one of two brothers. My father
-LRB-a farmer-RRB- made a will and left his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) farm and stock and so forth to my
mother for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life. After my mother's death, all was to come to me
except a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my
brother. My mother died. My brother some time afterwards claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
legacy. I and some of my relations said that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had had a part of it
already in board and lodging and some other things. Now mind! That
was the question, and nothing else. No one disputed the will; no one
disputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had
been already paid or not. To settle that question, my brother filing
a bill, I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery; I was forced
there because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else.
Seventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit! It first
came on after two years. It was then stopped for another two years
while the master -LRB-may his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head rot off!-RRB- inquired whether I was my
father's son, about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal
creature. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) then found out that there were not defendants
enough--remember, there were only seventeen as yet!--but that we must
have another who had been left out and must begin all over again. The
costs at that time--before the thing was begun!--were three times the
legacy. My brother would have given up the legacy, and joyful, to
escape more costs. My whole estate, left to me in that will of my
father's, has gone in costs. The suit, still undecided, has fallen
into rack, and ruin, and despair, with everything else--and here I
stand, this day! Now, Mr. Jarndyce, in your suit there are thousands
and thousands involved, where in mine there are hundreds. Is mine
less hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was
in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) condoled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) heart and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this
monstrous system.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gridley/Mr. Gridley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) rage. ``The
system! I am told on all hands, it's the system. I mustn't look to
individuals. It's the system. I mustn't go into court and say, ``My
Lord, I beg to know this from you--is this right or wrong? Have you
the face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am
dismissed?'' My Lord knows nothing of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sits there to administer
the system. I mustn't go to Mr. Tulkinghorn, the solicitor in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, and say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) makes me furious by
being so cool and satisfied--as they all do, for I know they gain by
it while I lose, don't I?--I mustn't say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>), ``I will have
something out of some one for my ruin, by fair means or foul!<div class="bookquote">'' HE (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) is
not responsible. It's the system. But, if I do no violence to any of
them, here--I may! I don't know what may happen if I am carried
beyond myself at last! I will accuse the individual workers of that
system against me, face to face, before the great eternal bar!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) passion was fearful. I could not have believed in such rage
without seeing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) said, sitting down and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Jarndyce, I have done! I am violent, I know. I ought to know it. I
have been in prison for contempt of court. I have been in prison for
threatening the solicitor. I have been in this trouble, and that
trouble, and shall be again. I am the man from Shropshire, and I
sometimes go beyond amusing them, though they have found it amusing,
too, to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and
all that. It would be better for me, they tell me, if I restrained
myself. I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become
imbecile. I was a good-enough-tempered man once, I believe. People in
my part of the country say they remember me so, but now I must have
this vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits
together. It would be far better for you, Mr. Gridley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>the Lord
Chancellor told me last week, `not to waste your time here, and to
stay, usefully employed, down in Shropshire.'' ``My Lord, my Lord, I
know it would,<div class="bookquote">'' said I to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), `and it would have been far better for
me never to have heard the name of your high office, but unhappily
for me, I can't undo the past, and the past drives me here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Besides,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) added, breaking fiercely out, ``I'll shame them. To the
last, I'll show myself in that court to its shame. If I knew when I
was going to die, and could be carried there, and had a voice to
speak with, I would die there, saying, <div class="bookquote">``You have brought me here and
sent me from here many and many a time. Now send me out feet
foremost!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) countenance had, perhaps for years, become so set in its
contentious expression that it did not soften, even now when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) was
quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) said,
going to them again, <div class="bookquote">``and let them play about. I didn't mean to say
all this, but it don't much signify. You're not afraid of me, Tom,
are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``You ain't angry with ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, my child. You're going back, Charley? Aye? Come then,
little one!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took the youngest child on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) was
willing enough to be carried. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't wonder if we found a
ginger-bread soldier downstairs. Let's go and look for him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) former rough salutation, which was not deficient in a
certain respect, to Mr. Jarndyce, and bowing slightly to us, went
downstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) room.

<p/>Upon that, Mr. Skimpole began to talk, for the first time since our
arrival, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) usual gay strain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, Well, it was really very
pleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes.
Here was this Mr. Gridley, a man of a robust will and surprising
energy--intellectually speaking, a sort of inharmonious
blacksmith--and he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) could easily imagine that there Gridley was, years
ago, wandering about in life for something to expend his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) superfluous
combativeness upon--a sort of Young Love among the thorns--when the
Court of Chancery came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) way and accommodated him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) with the exact
thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) wanted. There they were, matched, ever afterwards! Otherwise
he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) might have been a great general, blowing up all sorts of towns, or
he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) might have been a great politician, dealing in all sorts of
parliamentary rhetoric; but as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) and the Court of Chancery
had fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way, and nobody was
much the worse, and Gridley was, so to speak, from that hour provided
for. Then look at Coavinses! How delightfully poor Coavinses -LRB-father
of these charming children-RRB- illustrated the same principle! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Mr.
Skimpole, himself, had sometimes repined at the existence of
Coavinses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had found Coavinses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) could had dispensed
with Coavinses. There had been times when, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been a sultan,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) grand vizier had said one morning, <div class="bookquote">``What does the Commander
of the Faithful require at the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) slave?''  (<font color='red'><b>vizier</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) might have
even gone so far as to reply, <div class="bookquote">``The head of Coavinses!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But what
turned out to be the case? That, all that time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been giving
employment to a most deserving man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been a benefactor to
Coavinses, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up
these charming children in this agreeable way, developing these
social virtues! Insomuch that his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) heart had just now swelled and the
tears had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had looked round the room and
thought, <div class="bookquote">``I was the great patron of Coavinses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) little
comforts were MY work!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something so captivating in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) light way of touching these
fantastic strings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was such a mirthful child by the side of
the graver childhood we had seen, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) made my guardian smile even
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder.
We kissed Charley, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) downstairs with us, and stopped
outside the house to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) run away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) work. I don't know where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) was going, but we saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) run, such a little, little creature in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) womanly bonnet and apron, through a covered way at the bottom of
the court and melt into the city's strife and sound like a dewdrop in
an ocean.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI

<p/>Tom-all-Alone's


<p/>My Lady Dedlock is restless, very restless. The astonished
fashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). To-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
is at Chesney Wold; yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) house in town; to-morrow
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) may be abroad, for anything the fashionable intelligence can with
confidence predict. Even Sir Leicester's gallantry has some trouble
to keep pace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). It would have more but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) other faithful
ally, for better and for worse--the gout--darts into the old oak
bed-chamber at Chesney Wold and grips him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) by both legs.

<p/>Sir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon, but still a
demon of the patrician order. All the Dedlocks, in the direct male
line, through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of
man goeth not to the contrary, have had the gout. It can be proved,
sir. Other men's fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have
taken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar, but
the Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the
levelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout. It has
come down through the illustrious line like the plate, or the
pictures, or the place in Lincolnshire. It is among their dignities.
Sir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression, though he (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>)
has never resolved it into words, that the angel of death in the
discharge of his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) necessary duties may observe to the shades of the
aristocracy, <div class="bookquote">``My lords and gentlemen, I have the honour to present to
you another Dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Hence Sir Leicester yields up his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) family legs to the family disorder
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) name and fortune on that feudal tenure. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) feels
that for a Dedlock to be laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) back and spasmodically
twitched and stabbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) extremities is a liberty taken somewhere,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) thinks, <div class="bookquote">``We have all yielded to this; it belongs to us; it has
for some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make
the vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms; and I
submit myself to the compromise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And a goodly show he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) makes, lying in a flush of crimson and gold in
the midst of the great drawing-room before his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) favourite picture of
my Lady, with broad strips of sunlight shining in, down the long
perspective, through the long line of windows, and alternating with
soft reliefs of shadow. Outside, the stately oaks, rooted for ages in
the green ground which has never known ploughshare, but was still a
chase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode
a-hunting with bow and arrow, bear witness to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) greatness. Inside,
his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) forefathers, looking on him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) from the walls, say, <div class="bookquote">``Each of us was
a passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and
melted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks
now lulling you to rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and hear their testimony to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) greatness
too. And he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) is very great this day. And woe to Boythorn or other
daring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>)!

<p/>My Lady is at present represented, near Sir Leicester, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
portrait. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has flitted away to town, with no intention of
remaining there, and will soon flit hither again, to the confusion of
the fashionable intelligence. The house in town is not prepared for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) reception. It is muffled and dreary. Only one Mercury in powder
gapes disconsolate at the hall-window; and he (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) mentioned last night to
another Mercury of his (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) acquaintance, also accustomed to good society,
that if that sort of thing was to last--which it couldn't, for a man
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirits couldn't bear it, and a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure couldn't be
expected to bear it--there would be no resource for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
honour, but to cut his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat!

<p/>What connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the
house in town, the Mercury in powder, and the whereabout of Jo the
outlaw with the broom, who had that distant ray of light upon him (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) swept the churchyard-step? What connexion can there have been
between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who
from opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very
curiously brought together!

<p/>Jo sweeps his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) crossing all day long, unconscious of the link, if any
link there be. He (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) sums up his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) mental condition when asked a question
by replying that he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``don't know nothink.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) knows that it's hard to
keep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather, and harder still to
live by doing it. Nobody taught him (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) even that much; he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) found it out.

<p/>Jo lives--that is to say, Jo has not yet died--in a ruinous place
known to the like of him (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) by the name of Tom-all-Alone's. It is a
black, dilapidated street, avoided by all decent people, where the
crazy houses were seized upon, when their decay was far advanced, by
some bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took
to letting them out in lodgings. Now, these tumbling tenements
contain, by night, a swarm of misery. As on the ruined human wretch
vermin parasites appear, so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd
of foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards;
and coils itself to sleep, in maggot numbers, where the rain drips
in; and comes and goes, fetching and carrying fever and sowing more
evil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle, and Sir Thomas Doodle,
and the Duke of Foodle, and all the fine gentlemen in office, down to
Zoodle, shall set right in five hundred years--though born expressly
to do it.

<p/>Twice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust, like the
springing of a mine, in Tom-all-Alone's; and each time a house has
fallen. These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and
have filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital. The gaps remain,
and there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish. As several
more houses are nearly ready to go, the next crash in Tom-all-Alone's
may be expected to be a good one.

<p/>This desirable property is in Chancery, of course. It would be an
insult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so.
Whether <div class="bookquote">``Tom''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom the representative</b></font>)</div>is the popular representative of the original plaintiff
or defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, or whether Tom lived here when
the suit had laid the street waste, all alone, until other settlers
came to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive
name for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the
pale of hope, perhaps nobody knows. Certainly Jo don't know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>It must be a strange state to be like Jo! To shuffle through the
streets, unfamiliar with the shapes, and in utter darkness as to the
meaning, of those mysterious symbols, so abundant over the shops, and
at the corners of streets, and on the doors, and in the windows! To
see people read, and to see people write, and to see the postmen
deliver letters, and not to have the least idea of all that
language--to be, to every scrap of it, stone blind and dumb! It must
be very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on
Sundays, with their books in their hands, and to think -LRB-for perhaps
Jo DOES think at odd times-RRB- what does it all mean, and if it means
anything to anybody, how comes it that it means nothing to me? To be
hustled, and jostled, and moved on; and really to feel that it would
appear to be perfectly true that I have no business here, or there,
or anywhere; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM
here somehow, too, and everybody overlooked me until I became the
creature that I am! It must be a strange state, not merely to be told
that I am scarcely human -LRB-as in the case of my offering myself for a
witness-RRB-, but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life! To see the
horses, dogs, and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I
belong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape, whose
delicacy I offend! Jo's ideas of a criminal trial, or a judge, or a
bishop, or a government, or that inestimable jewel to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) only
knew it-RRB- the Constitution, should be strange! His (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) whole material and
immaterial life is wonderfully strange; his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) death, the strangest
thing of all.

<p/>Jo comes out of Tom-all-Alone's, meeting the tardy morning which is
always late in getting down there, and munches his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) dirty bit of bread
as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) comes along. His (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) way lying through many streets, and the houses
not yet being open, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives
it a brush when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) has finished as an acknowledgment of the
accommodation. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) admires the size of the edifice and wonders what
it's all about. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) has no idea, poor wretch, of the spiritual
destitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look
up the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) goes to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) crossing and begins to lay it out for the day. The
town awakes; the great tee-totum is set up for its daily spin and
whirl; all that unaccountable reading and writing, which has been
suspended for a few hours, recommences. Jo and the other lower
animals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can. It is
market-day. The blinded oxen, over-goaded, over-driven, never guided,
run into wrong places and are beaten out, and plunge red-eyed and
foaming at stone walls, and often sorely hurt the innocent, and often
sorely hurt themselves. Very like Jo and his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) order; very, very like!

<p/>A band of music comes and plays. Jo listens to it. So does a dog--a
drover's dog, waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) master outside a butcher's shop, and
evidently thinking about those sheep he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) has had upon his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) mind for
some hours and is happily rid of. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) seems perplexed respecting three
or four, can't remember where he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) left them, looks up and down the
street as half expecting to see them astray, suddenly pricks up his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
ears and remembers all about it. A thoroughly vagabond dog,
accustomed to low company and public-houses; a terrific dog to sheep,
ready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls
of their wool; but an educated, improved, developed dog who has been
taught his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) duties and knows how to discharge them. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) and Jo listen
to the music, probably with much the same amount of animal
satisfaction; likewise as to awakened association, aspiration, or
regret, melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses,
they are probably upon a par. But, otherwise, how far above the human
listener is the brute!

<p/>Turn that dog's descendants wild, like Jo, and in a very few years
they will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark--but not
their bite.

<p/>The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly.
Jo fights it out at his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) crossing among the mud and wheels, the
horses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum to pay for
the unsavoury shelter of Tom-all-Alone's. Twilight comes on; gas
begins to start up in the shops; the lamplighter, with his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) ladder,
runs along the margin of the pavement. A wretched evening is
beginning to close in.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the
nearest magistrate to-morrow morning for a warrant. Gridley, a
disappointed suitor, has been here to-day and has been alarming. We
are not to be put in bodily fear, and that ill-conditioned fellow
shall be held to bail again. From the ceiling, foreshortened
Allegory, in the person of one impossible Roman upside down, points
with the arm of Samson -LRB-out of joint, and an odd one-RRB- obtrusively
toward the window. Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn, for such no reason,
look out of window? Is the hand not always pointing there? So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) does
not look out of window.

<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) did, what would it be to see a woman going by? There are
women enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks--too many; they are
at the bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of
that, they create business for lawyers. What would it be to see a
woman going by, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were going secretly? They are all
secret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.

<p/>But they are not all like the woman who now leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) house
behind, between whose plain dress and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refined manner there is
something exceedingly inconsistent. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should be an upper servant by
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attire, yet in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) air and step, though both are hurried and
assumed--as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can assume in the muddy streets, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
treads with an unaccustomed foot--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a lady. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face is veiled,
and still she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of
those who pass her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look round sharply.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never turns her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. Lady or servant, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a purpose in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
and can follow it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never turns her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes to the
crossing where Jo plies with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) broom. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) crosses with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and begs.
Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) does not turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head until she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has landed on the other
side. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) slightly beckons to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) and says, <div class="bookquote">``Come here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo follows her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a pace or two into a quiet court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
veil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, staring moodily at the veil, <div class="bookquote">``nothink about
no papers. I don't know nothink about nothink at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you examined at an inquest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothink about no--where I was took by the beadle, do
you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo. <div class="bookquote">``Was the boy's name at the inkwhich Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come farther up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean about the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, following. <div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as wos dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Speak in a whisper! Yes. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was living, so
very ill and poor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, jist!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look like--not like YOU?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>says the woman with abhorrence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not so bad as me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a reg`lar one I am! You didn't
know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you ask me if I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No offence, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo with much humility, for even he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) has
got at the suspicion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) being a lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a lady. I am a servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a jolly servant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo without the least idea of saying
anything offensive, merely as a tribute of admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen and be silent. Don't talk to me, and stand farther from me!
Can you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I
read? The place he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wrote for, the place he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) died at, the place where
you were taken to, and the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was buried? Do you know the
place where he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was buried?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo answers with a nod, having also nodded as each other place was
mentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go before me and show me all those dreadful places. Stop opposite to
each, and don't speak to me unless I speak to you. Don't look back.
Do what I want, and I will pay you well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo attends closely while the words are being spoken; tells them off
on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) broom-handle, finding them rather hard; pauses to consider
their meaning; considers it satisfactory; and nods his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ragged head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm fly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo. <div class="bookquote">``But fen larks, you know. Stow hooking it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does the horrible creature mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>exclaims the servant,
recoiling from him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stow cutting away, you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you. Go on before! I will give you more money
than you ever had in your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo screws up his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mouth into a whistle, gives his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ragged head a rub,
takes his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) broom under his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) arm, and leads the way, passing deftly with
his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire.

<p/>Cook's Court. Jo stops. A pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who lives here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wot give him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) writing and give me half a bull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo in a
whisper without looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on to the next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div><p/>Krook's house. Jo stops again. A longer pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who lives here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lived here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>Jo answers as before.

<p/>After a silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) is asked, <div class="bookquote">``In which room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the back room up there. You can see the winder from this corner.
Up there! That's where I see him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stritched out. This is the
public-ouse where I was took to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on to the next!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>It is a longer walk to the next, but Jo, relieved of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) first
suspicions, sticks to the forms imposed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) and does not look
round. By many devious ways, reeking with offence of many kinds, they
come to the little tunnel of a court, and to the gas-lamp -LRB-lighted
now-RRB-, and to the iron gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was put there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, holding to the bars and looking in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where? Oh, what a scene of horror!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, pointing. <div class="bookquote">``Over yinder. Among them piles of bones,
and close to that there kitchin winder! They put him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wery nigh the
top. They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in. I could unkiver
it for you with my broom if the gate was open. That's why they locks
it, I s`pose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>giving it a shake. <div class="bookquote">``It's always locked. Look at the
rat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>cries Jo, excited. <div class="bookquote">``Hi! Look! There he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) goes! Ho! Into the
ground!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div><p/>The servant shrinks into a corner, into a corner of that hideous
archway, with its deadly stains contaminating her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dress; and putting
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) two hands and passionately telling him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to keep away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>),
for he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is loathsome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), so remains for some moments. Jo stands
staring and is still staring when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) recovers herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this place of abomination consecrated ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothink of consequential ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, still
staring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it blessed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, in the last degree amazed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it blessed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm blest if I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, staring more than ever; <div class="bookquote">``but I
shouldn't think it warn't. Blest?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>repeats Jo, something troubled in
his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``It an't done it much good if it is. Blest? I should think
it was t`othered myself. But I don't know nothink!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The servant takes as little heed of what he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) says as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seems to take
of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has said herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) draws off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) glove to get some
money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
hand is and what a jolly servant she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) must be to wear such sparkling
rings.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) drops a piece of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand without touching it, and
shuddering as their hands approach. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) adds, <div class="bookquote">``show me the
spot again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo thrusts the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) broom between the bars of the gate, and
with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) utmost power of elaboration, points it out. At length,
looking aside to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) has made himself intelligible, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) finds
that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is alone.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas-light
and to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow--gold. His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) next is
to give it a one-sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality.
His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) next, to put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mouth for safety and to sweep the
step and passage with great care. His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) job done, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sets off for
Tom-all-Alone's, stopping in the light of innumerable gas-lamps to
produce the piece of gold and give it another one-sided bite as a
reassurance of its being genuine.

<p/>The Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night, for my Lady
goes to a grand dinner and three or four balls. Sir Leicester is
fidgety down at Chesney Wold, with no better company than the gout;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous
pattering on the terrace that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) can't read the paper even by the
fireside in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) own snug dressing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the
house, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) dressing-room is
on my Lady's side. And in all these years I never heard the step upon
the Ghost's Walk more distinct than it is to-night!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Miss Summerson/Esther Summerson</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>Richard very often came to see us while we remained in London -LRB-though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) soon failed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) letter-writing-RRB-, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) quick abilities,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) good spirits, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) good temper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gaiety and freshness, was
always delightful. But though I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) more and more the better I
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had been educated in no habits of application and
concentration. The system which had addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in exactly the same
manner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys, all varying in
character and capacity, had enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to dash through his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) tasks,
always with fair credit and often with distinction, but in a fitful,
dazzling way that had confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) reliance on those very qualities
in himself which it had been most desirable to direct and train. They
were good qualities, without which no high place can be meritoriously
won, but like fire and water, though excellent servants, they were
very bad masters. If they had been under Richard's direction, they
would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) friends; but Richard being under their direction,
they became his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) enemies.

<p/>I write down these opinions not because I believe that this or any
other thing was so because I thought so, but only because I did think
so and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did. These
were my thoughts about Richard. I thought I often observed besides
how right my guardian was in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had said, and that the
uncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
nature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was part of a great gaming system.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was
not at home, in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after
Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mr. Carstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``is very well and is, I assure
you, a great acquisition to our society. Captain Swosser used to say
of me that I was always better than land a-head and a breeze a-starn
to the midshipmen's mess when the purser's junk had become as tough
as the fore-topsel weather earings. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) naval way of
mentioning generally that I was an acquisition to any society. I may
render the same tribute, I am sure, to Mr. Carstone. But I--you won't
think me premature if I mention it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/>I said no, as Mrs. Badger's insinuating tone seemed to require such
an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor Miss Clare?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bayham Badger sweetly.

<p/>Ada said no, too, and looked uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Badger, <div class="bookquote">''--you'll excuse me
calling you my dears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/>We entreated Mrs. Badger not to mention it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you really are, if I may take the liberty of saying so,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``so perfectly charming. You see, my dears, that
although I am still young--or Mr. Bayham Badger pays me the
compliment of saying so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>Mr. Badger called out like some one contradicting at a public
meeting. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>smiled Mrs. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``we will say still young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dears, though still young, I have had many opportunities of
observing young men. There were many such on board the dear old
Crippler, I assure you. After that, when I was with Captain Swosser
in the Mediterranean, I embraced every opportunity of knowing and
befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser's command. YOU never
heard them called the young gentlemen, my dears, and probably would
not understand allusions to their pipe-claying their weekly accounts,
but it is otherwise with me, for blue water has been a second home to
me, and I have been quite a sailor. Again, with Professor Dingo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man of European reputation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>murmured Mr. Badger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I lost my dear first and became the wife of my dear second,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Badger, speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) former husbands as if they were
parts of a charade, <div class="bookquote">``I still enjoyed opportunities of observing
youth. The class attendant on Professor Dingo's lectures was a large
one, and it became my pride, as the wife of an eminent scientific man
seeking herself in science the utmost consolation it could impart, to
throw our house open to the students as a kind of Scientific
Exchange. Every Tuesday evening there was lemonade and a mixed
biscuit for all who chose to partake of those refreshments. And there
was science to an unlimited extent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husbands</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remarkable assemblies those, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger
reverentially. <div class="bookquote">``There must have been great intellectual friction
going on there under the auspices of such a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``now that I am the wife of my dear
third, Mr. Badger, I still pursue those habits of observation which
were formed during the lifetime of Captain Swosser and adapted to new
and unexpected purposes during the lifetime of Professor Dingo. I
therefore have not come to the consideration of Mr. Carstone as a
neophyte. And yet I am very much of the opinion, my dears, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>)
has not chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) profession advisedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada looked so very anxious now that I asked Mrs. Badger on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>)
founded her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) supposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``on Mr. Carstone's character
and conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) is of such a very easy disposition that probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>)
would never think it worth-while to mention how he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) really feels, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) feels languid about the profession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) has not that positive
interest in it which makes it his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) vocation. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) has any decided
impression in reference to it, I should say it was that it is a
tiresome pursuit. Now, this is not promising. Young men like Mr.
Allan Woodcourt who take it from a strong interest in all that it can
do will find some reward in it through a great deal of work for a
very little money and through years of considerable endurance and
disappointment. But I am quite convinced that this would never be the
case with Mr. Carstone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Mr. Badger think so too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>asked Ada timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``to tell the truth, Miss Clare, this view of
the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. Badger mentioned it. But
when Mrs. Badger put it in that light, I naturally gave great
consideration to it, knowing that Mrs. Badger's mind, in addition to
its natural advantages, has had the rare advantage of being formed by
two such very distinguished -LRB-I will even say illustrious-RRB- public men
as Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy and Professor Dingo. The
conclusion at which I have arrived is--in short, is Mrs. Badger's
conclusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a maxim of Captain Swosser's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Badger, ``speaking in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) figurative naval manner, that when you make pitch hot, you cannot
make it too hot; and that if you only have to swab a plank, you
should swab it as if Davy Jones were after you. It appears to me that
this maxim is applicable to the medical as well as to the nautical
profession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To all professions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Badger. <div class="bookquote">``It was admirably said by
Captain Swosser. Beautifully said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People objected to Professor Dingo when we were staying in the north
of Devon after our marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Badger, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) disfigured
some of the houses and other buildings by chipping off fragments of
those edifices with his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) little geological hammer. But the professor
replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) knew of no building save the Temple of Science. The
principle is the same, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Badger/Mrs. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Badger/Mr. Bayham Badger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Badger. <div class="bookquote">``Finely expressed! The
professor made the same remark, Miss Summerson, in his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) last illness,
when -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) mind wandering-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) insisted on keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) little hammer
under the pillow and chipping at the countenances of the attendants.
The ruling passion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mrs.</b></font>)</div><p/>Although we could have dispensed with the length at which Mr. and
Mrs. Badger pursued the conversation, we both felt that it was
disinterested in them to express the opinion they had communicated to
us and that there was a great probability of its being sound. We
agreed to say nothing to Mr. Jarndyce until we had spoken to Richard;
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was coming next evening, we resolved to have a very serious
talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/>So after he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had been a little while with Ada, I went in and found my
darling -LRB-as I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) would be-RRB- prepared to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) thoroughly
right in whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you get on, Richard?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. I always sat down on the
other side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) made quite a sister of me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Well enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) can't say better than that, Esther, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried my pet
triumphantly.

<p/>I tried to look at my pet in the wisest manner, but of course I
couldn't.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well enough?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``well enough. It's rather jog-trotty and
humdrum. But it'll do as well as anything else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! My dear Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as well as anything else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think there's any harm in that, Dame Durden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada,
looking so confidingly at me across him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``because if it will do as
well as anything else, it will do very well, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, carelessly tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hair
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``After all, it may be only a kind of probation
till our suit is--I forgot though. I am not to mention the suit.
Forbidden ground! Oh, yes, it's all right enough. Let us talk about
something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada would have done so willingly, and with a full persuasion that we
had brought the question to a most satisfactory state. But I thought
it would be useless to stop there, so I began again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and my dear Ada! Consider how important
it is to you both, and what a point of honour it is towards your
cousin, that you, Richard, should be quite in earnest without any
reservation. I think we had better talk about this, really, Ada. It
will be too late very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! We must talk about it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada. <div class="bookquote">``But I think Richard is
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What was the use of my trying to look wise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was so pretty,
and so engaging, and so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. and Mrs. Badger were here yesterday, Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and they
seemed disposed to think that you had no great liking for the
profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did they though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Well, that rather alters the
case, because I had no idea that they thought so, and I should not
have liked to disappoint or inconvenience them. The fact is, I don't
care much about it. But, oh, it don't matter! It'll do as well as
anything else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), Ada!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Richard proceeded, half thoughtfully and half
jocosely, <div class="bookquote">``it is not quite in my way. I don't take to it. And I get
too much of Mrs. Bayham Badger's first and second.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>``I am sure THAT``S very natural!'' cried Ada, quite delighted. <div class="bookquote">``The
very thing we both said yesterday, Esther!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>pursued Richard, <div class="bookquote">``it's monotonous, and to-day is too like
yesterday, and to-morrow is too like to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``this is an objection to all kinds of
application--to life itself, except under some very uncommon
circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, still considering. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps! Ha!
Why, then, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) added, suddenly becoming gay again, <div class="bookquote">``we
travel outside a circle to what I said just now. It'll do as well as
anything else. Oh, it's all right enough! Let us talk about something
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But even Ada, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) loving face--and if it had seemed innocent and
trusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog, how much
more did it seem now when I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) innocent and trusting
heart--even Ada shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head at this and looked serious. So I
thought it a good opportunity to hint to Richard that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) were
sometimes a little careless of himself, I was very sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) never
meant to be careless of Ada, and that it was a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
affectionate consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) not to slight the importance of a
step that might influence both their lives. This made him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) almost
grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mother Hubbard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's the very thing! I have
thought of that several times and have been quite angry with myself
for meaning to be so much in earnest and--somehow--not exactly being
so. I don't know how it is; I seem to want something or other to
stand by. Even you have no idea how fond I am of Ada -LRB-my darling
cousin, I love you, so much!-RRB-, but I don't settle down to constancy
in other things. It's such uphill work, and it takes such a time!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Richard with an air of vexation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested, <div class="bookquote">``because you don't like what you have
chosen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I don't wonder at it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No. It was not of the least use my trying to look wise. I tried
again, but how could I do it, or how could it have any effect if I
could, while Ada rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) clasped hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) shoulder and while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) tender blue eyes, and while they looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, my precious girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) golden curls
through and through his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``I was a little hasty perhaps; or I
misunderstood my own inclinations perhaps. They don't seem to lie in
that direction. I couldn't tell till I tried. Now the question is
whether it's worth-while to undo all that has been done. It seems
like making a great disturbance about nothing particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``how CAN you say about nothing
particular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean absolutely that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``I mean that it MAY be
nothing particular because I may never want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Ada and I urged, in reply, not only that it was decidedly
worth-while to undo what had been done, but that it must be undone. I
then asked Richard whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had thought of any more congenial
pursuit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, my dear Mrs. Shipton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``you touch me home. Yes,
I have. I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The law!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>repeated Ada as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) were afraid of the name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I went into Kenge's office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``and if I were placed
under articles to Kenge, I should have my eye on the--hum!--the
forbidden ground--and should be able to study it, and master it, and
to satisfy myself that it was not neglected and was being properly
conducted. I should be able to look after Ada's interests and my own
interests -LRB-the same thing!-RRB-; and I should peg away at Blackstone and
all those fellows with the most tremendous ardour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>I was not by any means so sure of that, and I saw how his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hankering
after the vague things yet to come of those long-deferred hopes cast
a shade on Ada's face. But I thought it best to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in any
project of continuous exertion, and only advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to be quite sure
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind was made up now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Minerva,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``I am as steady as you are. I made a
mistake; we are all liable to mistakes; I won't do so any more, and
I'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen. That is, you know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, relapsing into doubt, <div class="bookquote">``if it really is worth-while,
after all, to make such a disturbance about nothing particular!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>This led to our saying again, with a great deal of gravity, all that
we had said already and to our coming to much the same conclusion
afterwards. But we so strongly advised Richard to be frank and open
with Mr. Jarndyce, without a moment's delay, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) disposition was
naturally so opposed to concealment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) out at once
-LRB-taking us with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)-RRB- and made a full avowal. <div class="bookquote">``Rick,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my
guardian, after hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) attentively, <div class="bookquote">``we can retreat with honour,
and we will. But we must be careful--for our cousin's sake, Rick, for
our cousin's sake--that we make no more such mistakes. Therefore, in
the matter of the law, we will have a good trial before we decide. We
will look before we leap, and take plenty of time about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard's energy was of such an impatient and fitful kind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
would have liked nothing better than to have gone to Mr. Kenge's
office in that hour and to have entered into articles with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) on the
spot. Submitting, however, with a good grace to the caution that we
had shown to be so necessary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) contented himself with sitting down
among us in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) lightest spirits and talking as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) one unvarying
purpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held
possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>). My guardian was very kind and cordial with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>),
but rather grave, enough so to cause Ada, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had departed and we
were going upstairs to bed, to say, <div class="bookquote">``Cousin John, I hope you don't
think the worse of Richard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it was very natural that Richard should be mistaken in such
a difficult case. It is not uncommon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't look unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am not unhappy, cousin John!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, smiling cheerfully,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) shoulder, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had put it in bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
good night. <div class="bookquote">``But I should be a little so if you thought at all the
worse of Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``I should think the worse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) only
if you were ever in the least unhappy through his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) means. I should be
more disposed to quarrel with myself even then, than with poor Rick,
for I brought you together. But, tut, all this is nothing! He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) has
time before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>), and the race to run. I think the worse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)? Not
I, my loving cousin! And not you, I swear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, cousin John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I could not--I am
sure I would not--think any ill of Richard if the whole world did. I
could, and I would, think better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) then than at any other time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>So quietly and honestly she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said it, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
shoulders--both hands now--and looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face, like the
picture of truth!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, thoughtfully regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I think it
must be somewhere written that the virtues of the mothers shall
occasionally be visited on the children, as well as the sins of the
father. Good night, my rosebud. Good night, little woman. Pleasant
slumbers! Happy dreams!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the first time I ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) follow Ada with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) eyes with
something of a shadow on their benevolent expression. I well
remembered the look with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had contemplated her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and Richard
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was singing in the firelight; it was but a very little while
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had watched them passing down the room in which the sun was
shining, and away into the shade; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) glance was changed, and
even the silent look of confidence in me which now followed it once
more was not quite so hopeful and untroubled as it had originally
been.

<p/>Ada praised Richard more to me that night than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had praised
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) went to sleep with a little bracelet he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
clasped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) arm. I fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was dreaming of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) when I kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cheek after she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had slept an hour and saw how tranquil and happy
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) looked.

<p/>For I was so little inclined to sleep myself that night that I sat up
working. It would not be worth mentioning for its own sake, but I was
wakeful and rather low-spirited. I don't know why. At least I don't
think I know why. At least, perhaps I do, but I don't think it
matters.

<p/>At any rate, I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I
would leave myself not a moment's leisure to be low-spirited. For I
naturally said, <div class="bookquote">``Esther! You to be low-spirited. YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And it really
was time to say so, for I--yes, I really did see myself in the glass,
almost crying. <div class="bookquote">``As if you had anything to make you unhappy, instead
of everything to make you happy, you ungrateful heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>If I could have made myself go to sleep, I would have done it
directly, but not being able to do that, I took out of my basket some
ornamental work for our house -LRB-I mean Bleak House-RRB- that I was busy
with at that time and sat down to it with great determination. It was
necessary to count all the stitches in that work, and I resolved to
go on with it until I couldn't keep my eyes open, and then to go to
bed.

<p/>I soon found myself very busy. But I had left some silk downstairs in
a work-table drawer in the temporary growlery, and coming to a stop
for want of it, I took my candle and went softly down to get it. To
my great surprise, on going in I found my guardian still there, and
sitting looking at the ashes. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was lost in thought, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) book lay
unheeded by his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) silvered iron-grey hair was scattered
confusedly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) forehead as though his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand had been wandering
among it while his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thoughts were elsewhere, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face looked worn.
Almost frightened by coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so unexpectedly, I stood still
for a moment and should have retired without speaking had he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) not, in
again passing his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand abstractedly through his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hair, seen me and
started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) what I had come for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At work so late, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am working late to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``because I couldn't sleep and
wished to tire myself. But, dear guardian, you are late too, and look
weary. You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None, little woman, that YOU would readily understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke in a regretful tone so new to me that I inwardly repeated,
as if that would help me to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) meaning, <div class="bookquote">``That I could readily
understand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remain a moment, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You were in my thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) slightly waved his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand and fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) usual manner. The change
was so remarkable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) appeared to make it by dint of so much
self-command, that I found myself again inwardly repeating, <div class="bookquote">``None
that I could understand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking--that is, I have
been thinking since I have been sitting here--that you ought to know
of your own history all I know. It is very little. Next to nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, <div class="bookquote">``when you spoke to me before on that
subject--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But since then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gravely interposed, anticipating what I meant to
say, <div class="bookquote">``I have reflected that your having anything to ask me, and my
having anything to tell you, are different considerations, Esther. It
is perhaps my duty to impart to you the little I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you think so, guardian, it is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) returned very gently, and kindly, and very
distinctly. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, I think so now. If any real disadvantage can
attach to your position in the mind of any man or woman worth a
thought, it is right that you at least of all the world should not
magnify it to yourself by having vague impressions of its nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to
be, ``One of my earliest remembrances, guardian, is of these words:
<div class="bookquote">``Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers. The time
will come, and soon enough, when you will understand this better, and
will feel it too, as no one save a woman can.'''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had covered my face
with my hands in repeating the words, but I took them away now with a
better kind of shame, I hope, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I owed the
blessing that I had from my childhood to that hour never, never,
never felt it. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand as if to stop me. I well knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was never to be thanked, and said no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine years, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said after thinking for a little while,
<div class="bookquote">``have passed since I received a letter from a lady living in
seclusion, written with a stern passion and power that rendered it
unlike all other letters I have ever read. It was written to me -LRB-as
it told me in so many words-RRB-, perhaps because it was the writer's
idiosyncrasy to put that trust in me, perhaps because it was mine to
justify it. It told me of a child, an orphan girl then twelve years
old, in some such cruel words as those which live in your
remembrance. It told me that the writer had bred her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in secrecy from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) birth, had blotted out all trace of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) existence, and that if
the writer were to die before the child became a woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be
left entirely friendless, nameless, and unknown. It asked me to
consider if I would, in that case, finish what the writer had begun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I listened in silence and looked attentively at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your early recollection, my dear, will supply the gloomy medium
through which all this was seen and expressed by the writer, and the
distorted religion which clouded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind with impressions of the
need there was for the child to expiate an offence of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
quite innocent. I felt concerned for the little creature, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
darkened life, and replied to the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I took his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand and kissed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It laid the injunction on me that I should never propose to see the
writer, who had long been estranged from all intercourse with the
world, but who would see a confidential agent if I would appoint one.
I accredited Mr. Kenge. The lady said, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own accord and not of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) seeking, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name was an assumed one. That she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, if there
were any ties of blood in such a case, the child's aunt. That more
than this she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would never -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) was well persuaded of the
steadfastness of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resolution-RRB- for any human consideration
disclose. My dear, I have told you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I held his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand for a little while in mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw my ward oftener than she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) saw me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added, cheerily making
light of it, <div class="bookquote">``and I always knew she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was beloved, useful, and happy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) repays me twenty-thousandfold, and twenty more to that, every
hour in every day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And oftener still,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) blesses the guardian who is a
father to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>At the word father, I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) former trouble come into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
subdued it as before, and it was gone in an instant; but it had been
there and it had come so swiftly upon my words that I felt as if they
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a shock. I again inwardly repeated, wondering, <div class="bookquote">``That I
could readily understand. None that I could readily understand!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No,
it was true. I did not understand it. Not for many and many a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a fatherly good night, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), kissing me on the
forehead, <div class="bookquote">``and so to rest. These are late hours for working and
thinking. You do that for all of us, all day long, little
housekeeper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I neither worked nor thought any more that night. I opened my
grateful heart to heaven in thankfulness for its providence to me and
its care of me, and fell asleep.

<p/>We had a visitor next day. Mr. Allan Woodcourt came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) came to take
leave of us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had settled to do so beforehand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was going to
China and to India as a surgeon on board ship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was to be away a
long, long time.

<p/>I believe--at least I know--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was not rich. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) widowed
mother could spare had been spent in qualifying him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
profession. It was not lucrative to a young practitioner, with very
little influence in London; and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was, night and day, at
the service of numbers of poor people and did wonders of gentleness
and skill for them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) gained very little by it in money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was
seven years older than I. Not that I need mention it, for it hardly
seems to belong to anything.

<p/>I think--I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) told us--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had been in practice three or
four years and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) could have hoped to contend through three
or four more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would not have made the voyage on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was
bound. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had no fortune or private means, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was going
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had been to see us several times altogether. We thought it a
pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) should go away. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was distinguished in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) art among
those who knew it best, and some of the greatest men belonging to it
had a high opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>).

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) came to bid us good-bye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) mother with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) for
the first time. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a pretty old lady, with bright black eyes,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed proud. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came from Wales and had had, a long time
ago, an eminent person for an ancestor, of the name of Morgan
ap-Kerrig--of some place that sounded like Gimlet--who was the most
illustrious person that ever was known and all of whose relations
were a sort of royal family. He (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) appeared to have passed his (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) life
in always getting up into mountains and fighting somebody; and
a bard whose name sounded like Crumlinwallinwer had sung his (<font color='blue'><b>bard</b></font>)
praises in a piece which was called, as nearly as I could catch it,
Mewlinnwillinwodd.

<p/>Mrs. Woodcourt, after expatiating to us on the fame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) great
kinsman, said that no doubt wherever her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) son Allan went he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) would
remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) pedigree and would on no account form an alliance below
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) that there were many handsome English ladies in
India who went out on speculation, and that there were some to be
picked up with property, but that neither charms nor wealth would
suffice for the descendant from such a line without birth, which must
ever be the first consideration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) talked so much about birth that
for a moment I half fancied, and with pain--But what an idle fancy to
suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) could think or care what MINE was!

<p/>Mr. Woodcourt seemed a little distressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) prolixity, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was
too considerate to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) see it and contrived delicately to bring
the conversation round to making his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) acknowledgments to my guardian
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) hospitality and for the very happy hours--he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) called them the
very happy hours--he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had passed with us. The recollection of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
said, would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) went and would be always
treasured. And so we gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) our hands, one after another--at least,
they did--and I did; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) lips to Ada's hand--and to
mine; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) went away upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) long, long voyage!

<p/>I was very busy indeed all day and wrote directions home to the
servants, and wrote notes for my guardian, and dusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) books and
papers, and jingled my housekeeping keys a good deal, one way and
another. I was still busy between the lights, singing and working by
the window, when who should come in but Caddy, whom I had no
expectation of seeing!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Caddy, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``what beautiful flowers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had such an exquisite little nosegay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I think so, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``They are the loveliest
I ever saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prince, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>answered Caddy, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head and holding them to me to
smell. <div class="bookquote">``Not Prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to be sure, Caddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``You must have two lovers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Do they look like that sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they look like that sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
cheek.

<p/>Caddy only laughed in return, and telling me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had come for
half an hour, at the expiration of which time Prince would be waiting
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) at the corner, sat chatting with me and Ada in the window,
every now and then handing me the flowers again or trying how they
looked against my hair. At last, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) took me into
my room and put them in my dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy with a kiss. <div class="bookquote">``They were left behind by
somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Left behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At poor Miss Flite's,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``Somebody who has been very good
to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was hurrying away an hour ago to join a ship and left these
flowers behind. No, no! Don't take them out. Let the pretty little
things lie here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, adjusting them with a careful hand,
<div class="bookquote">``because I was present myself, and I shouldn't wonder if somebody
left them on purpose!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they look like that sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, coming laughingly
behind me and clasping me merrily round the waist. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, indeed
they do, Dame Durden! They look very, very like that sort of thing.
Oh, very like it indeed, my dear!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVIII

<p/>Lady Dedlock


<p/>It was not so easy as it had appeared at first to arrange for
Richard's making a trial of Mr. Kenge's office. Richard himself was
the chief impediment. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) power to leave Mr.
Badger at any moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) began to doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wanted to leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) didn't know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said, really. It wasn't a bad
profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) couldn't assert that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) disliked it; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) liked
it as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) liked any other--suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gave it one more chance!
Upon that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) shut himself up for a few weeks with some books and
some bones and seemed to acquire a considerable fund of information
with great rapidity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fervour, after lasting about a month, began
to cool, and when it was quite cooled, began to grow warm again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
vacillations between law and medicine lasted so long that midsummer
arrived before he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) finally separated from Mr. Badger and entered on an
experimental course of Messrs. Kenge and Carboy. For all his (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>)
waywardness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) took great credit to himself as being determined to
be in earnest <div class="bookquote">``this time.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) was so good-natured throughout, and
in such high spirits, and so fond of Ada, that it was very difficult
indeed to be otherwise than pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>who, I may mention, found the wind much given,
during this period, to stick in the east; <div class="bookquote">``As to Mr. Jarndyce,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Richard would say to me, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is the finest fellow in the world,
Esther! I must be particularly careful, if it were only for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
satisfaction, to take myself well to task and have a regular wind-up
of this business now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) taking himself well to task, with that laughing face
and heedless manner and with a fancy that everything could catch and
nothing could hold, was ludicrously anomalous. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) told us
between-whiles that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was doing it to such an extent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
wondered his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hair didn't turn grey. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) regular wind-up of the
business was -LRB-as I have said-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) went to Mr. Kenge's about
midsummer to try how he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) liked it.

<p/>All this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) was, in money affairs, what I have described him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) in
a former illustration--generous, profuse, wildly careless, but fully
persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) was rather calculating and prudent. I happened to
say to Ada, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) presence, half jestingly, half seriously, about
the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) going to Mr. Kenge's, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) needed to have
Fortunatus' purse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) made so light of money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) answered in
this way, <div class="bookquote">``My jewel of a dear cousin, you hear this old woman! Why
does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say that? Because I gave eight pounds odd -LRB-or whatever it
was-RRB- for a certain neat waistcoat and buttons a few days ago. Now, if
I had stayed at Badger's I should have been obliged to spend twelve
pounds at a blow for some heart-breaking lecture-fees. So I make four
pounds--in a lump--by the transaction!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a question much discussed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) and my guardian what
arrangements should be made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) living in London while he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
experimented on the law, for we had long since gone back to Bleak
House, and it was too far off to admit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) coming there oftener
than once a week. My guardian told me that if Richard were to settle
down at Mr. Kenge's he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) would take some apartments or chambers where
we too could occasionally stay for a few days at a time; <div class="bookquote">``but, little
woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) added, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) head very significantly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) hasn't
settled down there yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The discussions ended in our hiring for him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>),
by the month, a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house
near Queen Square. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) immediately began to spend all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had
in buying the oddest little ornaments and luxuries for this lodging;
and so often as Ada and I dissuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) from making any purchase that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had in contemplation which was particularly unnecessary and
expensive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) took credit for what it would have cost and made out
that to spend anything less on something else was to save the
difference.

<p/>While these affairs were in abeyance, our visit to Mr. Boythorn's was
postponed. At length, Richard having taken possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lodging,
there was nothing to prevent our departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could have gone with
us at that time of the year very well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was in the full novelty
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) new position and was making most energetic attempts to unravel
the mysteries of the fatal suit. Consequently we went without him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>),
and my darling was delighted to praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) for being so busy.

<p/>We made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and
had an entertaining companion in Mr. Skimpole. His (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) furniture had been
all cleared off, it appeared, by the person who took possession of it
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) blue-eyed daughter's birthday, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) seemed quite relieved to
think that it was gone. Chairs and table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, were wearisome
objects; they were monotonous ideas, they had no variety of
expression, they looked you out of countenance, and you looked them
out of countenance. How pleasant, then, to be bound to no particular
chairs and tables, but to sport like a butterfly among all the
furniture on hire, and to flit from rosewood to mahogany, and from
mahogany to walnut, and from this shape to that, as the humour took
one!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The oddity of the thing is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole with a quickened
sense of the ludicrous, <div class="bookquote">``that my chairs and tables were not paid for,
and yet my landlord walks off with them as composedly as possible.
Now, that seems droll! There is something grotesque in it. The chair
and table merchant never engaged to pay my landlord my rent. Why
should my landlord quarrel with HIM? If I have a pimple on my nose
which is disagreeable to my landlord's peculiar ideas of beauty, my
landlord has no business to scratch my chair and table merchant's
nose, which has no pimple on it. His (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) reasoning seems defective!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian good-humouredly, <div class="bookquote">``it's pretty clear that
whoever became security for those chairs and tables will have to pay
for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole. ``That's the crowning point of
unreason in the business! I said to my landlord, ``My good man, you
are not aware that my excellent friend Jarndyce will have to pay for
those things that you are sweeping off in that indelicate manner.
Have you no consideration for HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) property?<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) hadn't the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And refused all proposals,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Refused all proposals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole. ``I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) business
proposals. I had him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) into my room. I said, ``You are a man of
business, I believe?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) replied, ``I am,'' ``Very well,<div class="bookquote">'' said I, `now
let us be business-like. Here is an inkstand, here are pens and
paper, here are wafers. What do you want? I have occupied your house
for a considerable period, I believe to our mutual satisfaction until
this unpleasant misunderstanding arose; let us be at once friendly
and business-like. What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>In reply to this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) made use
of the figurative expression--which has something Eastern about
it--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had never seen the colour of my money. <div class="bookquote">``My amiable
friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I never have any money. I never know anything about
money.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), `what do you offer if I give you time?''
``My good fellow,'' said I, ``I have no idea of time; but you say you
are a man of business, and whatever you can suggest to be done in a
business-like way with pen, and ink, and paper--and wafers--I am
ready to do. Don't pay yourself at another man's expense -LRB-which is
foolish-RRB-, but be business-like!<div class="bookquote">'' However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) wouldn't be, and there
was an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>another man</b></font>)</div><p/>If these were some of the inconveniences of Mr. Skimpole's childhood,
it assuredly possessed its advantages too. On the journey he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had a
very good appetite for such refreshment as came in our way -LRB-including
a basket of choice hothouse peaches-RRB-, but never thought of paying for
anything. So when the coachman came round for his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) fee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) pleasantly
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) considered a very good fee indeed, now--a liberal
one--and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) replying half a crown for a single passenger, said it
was little enough too, all things considered, and left Mr. Jarndyce
to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).

<p/>It was delightful weather. The green corn waved so beautifully, the
larks sang so joyfully, the hedges were so full of wild flowers, the
trees were so thickly out in leaf, the bean-fields, with a light wind
blowing over them, filled the air with such a delicious fragrance!
Late in the afternoon we came to the market-town where we were to
alight from the coach--a dull little town with a church-spire, and a
marketplace, and a market-cross, and one intensely sunny street, and
a pond with an old horse cooling his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) legs in it, and a very few men
sleepily lying and standing about in narrow little bits of shade.
After the rustling of the leaves and the waving of the corn all along
the road, it looked as still, as hot, as motionless a little town as
England could produce.

<p/>At the inn we found Mr. Boythorn on horseback, waiting with an open
carriage to take us to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) house, which was a few miles off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) was
overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) after giving us a courteous greeting. <div class="bookquote">``This a
most infamous coach. It is the most flagrant example of an abominable
public vehicle that ever encumbered the face of the earth. It is
twenty-five minutes after its time this afternoon. The coachman ought
to be put to death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``IS he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) happened to
address himself. <div class="bookquote">``You know my infirmity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five minutes! Twenty-six minutes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Boythorn,
referring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``With two ladies in the coach, this scoundrel
has deliberately delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) arrival six and twenty minutes.
Deliberately! It is impossible that it can be accidental! But his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)
father--and his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) uncle--were the most profligate coachmen that ever
sat upon a box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) said this in tones of the greatest indignation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) handed us
into the little phaeton with the utmost gentleness and was all smiles
and pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) said, standing bare-headed at the
carriage-door when all was ready, <div class="bookquote">``that I am obliged to conduct you
nearly two miles out of the way. But our direct road lies through Sir
Leicester Dedlock's park, and in that fellow's property I have sworn
never to set foot of mine, or horse's foot of mine, pending the
present relations between us, while I breathe the breath of life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And here, catching my guardian's eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) broke into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)
tremendous laughs, which seemed to shake even the motionless little
market-town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the Dedlocks down here, Lawrence?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian as we drove
along and Mr. Boythorn trotted on the green turf by the roadside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Arrogant Numskull is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Boythorn. <div class="bookquote">``Ha ha ha! Sir
Arrogant is here, and I am glad to say, has been laid by the heels
here. My Lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in naming whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) always made a courtly gesture as if
particularly to exclude her (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) from any part in the quarrel, <div class="bookquote">``is
expected, I believe, daily. I am not in the least surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
postpones her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) appearance as long as possible. Whatever can have
induced that transcendent woman to marry that effigy and figure-head
of a baronet is one of the most impenetrable mysteries that ever
baffled human inquiry. Ha ha ha ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``WE may set foot in the park
while we are here? The prohibition does not extend to us, does it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can lay no prohibition on my guests,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) said, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) head to
Ada and me with the smiling politeness which sat so gracefully upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``except in the matter of their departure. I am only sorry that I
cannot have the happiness of being their escort about Chesney Wold,
which is a very fine place! But by the light of this summer day,
Jarndyce, if you call upon the owner while you stay with me, you are
likely to have but a cool reception. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) carries himself like an
eight-day clock at all times, like one of a race of eight-day clocks
in gorgeous cases that never go and never went--Ha ha ha!--but he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
will have some extra stiffness, I can promise you, for the friends of
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) friend and neighbour Boythorn!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not put him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to the proof,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is as
indifferent to the honour of knowing me, I dare say, as I am to the
honour of knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>). The air of the grounds and perhaps such a view
of the house as any other sightseer might get are quite enough for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boythorn. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it on the whole. It's in
better keeping. I am looked upon about here as a second Ajax defying
the lightning. Ha ha ha ha! When I go into our little church on a
Sunday, a considerable part of the inconsiderable congregation expect
to see me drop, scorched and withered, on the pavement under the
Dedlock displeasure. Ha ha ha ha! I have no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is surprised
that I don't. For he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is, by heaven, the most self-satisfied, and the
shallowest, and the most coxcombical and utterly brainless ass!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Our coming to the ridge of a hill we had been ascending enabled our
friend to point out Chesney Wold itself to us and diverted his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>)
attention from its master.

<p/>It was a picturesque old house in a fine park richly wooded. Among
the trees and not far from the residence he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) pointed out the spire of
the little church of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) had spoken. Oh, the solemn woods over
which the light and shadow travelled swiftly, as if heavenly wings
were sweeping on benignant errands through the summer air; the smooth
green slopes, the glittering water, the garden where the flowers were
so symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest colours, how
beautiful they looked! The house, with gable and chimney, and tower,
and turret, and dark doorway, and broad terrace-walk, twining among
the balustrades of which, and lying heaped upon the vases, there was
one great flush of roses, seemed scarcely real in its light solidity
and in the serene and peaceful hush that rested on all around it. To
Ada and to me, that above all appeared the pervading influence. On
everything, house, garden, terrace, green slopes, water, old oaks,
fern, moss, woods again, and far away across the openings in the
prospect to the distance lying wide before us with a purple bloom
upon it, there seemed to be such undisturbed repose.

<p/>When we came into the little village and passed a small inn with the
sign of the Dedlock Arms swinging over the road in front, Mr.
Boythorn interchanged greetings with a young gentleman sitting on a
bench outside the inn-door who had some fishing-tackle lying beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the housekeeper's grandson, Mr. Rouncewell by name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is in love with a pretty girl up at the house. Lady
Dedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl and is going to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) own fair person--an honour which my young friend himself
does not at all appreciate. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) can't marry just yet, even if
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) Rosebud were willing; so he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is fain to make the best of it. In
the meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) comes here pretty often for a day or two at a time
to--fish. Ha ha ha ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and the pretty girl engaged, Mr. Boythorn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>asked Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear Miss Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I think they may perhaps
understand each other; but you will see them soon, I dare say, and I
must learn from you on such a point--not you from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada blushed, and Mr. Boythorn, trotting forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) comely grey
horse, dismounted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) own door and stood ready with extended arm
and uncovered head to welcome us when we arrived.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) lived in a pretty house, formerly the parsonage house, with a lawn
in front, a bright flower-garden at the side, and a well-stocked
orchard and kitchen-garden in the rear, enclosed with a venerable
wall that had of itself a ripened ruddy look. But, indeed, everything
about the place wore an aspect of maturity and abundance. The old
lime-tree walk was like green cloisters, the very shadows of the
cherry-trees and apple-trees were heavy with fruit, the
gooseberry-bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested
on the earth, the strawberries and raspberries grew in like
profusion, and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall. Tumbled
about among the spread nets and the glass frames sparkling and
winking in the sun there were such heaps of drooping pods, and
marrows, and cucumbers, that every foot of ground appeared a
vegetable treasury, while the smell of sweet herbs and all kinds of
wholesome growth -LRB-to say nothing of the neighbouring meadows where
the hay was carrying-RRB- made the whole air a great nosegay. Such
stillness and composure reigned within the orderly precincts of the
old red wall that even the feathers hung in garlands to scare the
birds hardly stirred; and the wall had such a ripening influence that
where, here and there high up, a disused nail and scrap of list still
clung to it, it was easy to fancy that they had mellowed with the
changing seasons and that they had rusted and decayed according to
the common fate.

<p/>The house, though a little disorderly in comparison with the garden,
was a real old house with settles in the chimney of the brick-floored
kitchen and great beams across the ceilings. On one side of it was
the terrible piece of ground in dispute, where Mr. Boythorn
maintained a sentry in a smock-frock day and night, whose duty was
supposed to be, in cases of aggression, immediately to ring a large
bell hung up there for the purpose, to unchain a great bull-dog
established in a kennel as his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) ally, and generally to deal
destruction on the enemy. Not content with these precautions, Mr.
Boythorn had himself composed and posted there, on painted boards to
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) name was attached in large letters, the following solemn
warnings: <div class="bookquote">``Beware of the bull-dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is most ferocious. Lawrence
Boythorn.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The blunderbus is loaded with slugs. Lawrence Boythorn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Man-traps and spring-guns are set here at all times of the day and
night. Lawrence Boythorn.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take notice. That any person or persons
audaciously presuming to trespass on this property will be punished
with the utmost severity of private chastisement and prosecuted with
the utmost rigour of the law. Lawrence Boythorn.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>These he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) showed us
from the drawing-room window, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) bird was hopping about his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)
head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to that extent as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) pointed them out that I really thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) would have hurt himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is taking a good deal of trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
light way, <div class="bookquote">``when you are not in earnest after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in earnest!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Boythorn with unspeakable warmth. <div class="bookquote">``Not
in earnest! If I could have hoped to train him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>), I would have bought a
lion instead of that dog and would have turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) loose upon the
first intolerable robber who should dare to make an encroachment on
my rights. Let Sir Leicester Dedlock consent to come out and decide
this question by single combat, and I will meet him (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) with any weapon
known to mankind in any age or country. I am that much in earnest.
Not more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We arrived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) house on a Saturday. On the Sunday morning we all
set forth to walk to the little church in the park. Entering the
park, almost immediately by the disputed ground, we pursued a
pleasant footpath winding among the verdant turf and the beautiful
trees until it brought us to the church-porch.

<p/>The congregation was extremely small and quite a rustic one with the
exception of a large muster of servants from the house, some of whom
were already in their seats, while others were yet dropping in. There
were some stately footmen, and there was a perfect picture of an old
coachman, who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>footmen</b></font>) were the official representative of all
the pomps and vanities that had ever been put into his (<font color='blue'><b>footmen</b></font>) coach. There
was a very pretty show of young women, and above them, the handsome
old face and fine responsible portly figure of the housekeeper
towered pre-eminent. The pretty girl of whom Mr. Boythorn had told us
was close by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so very pretty that I might have known her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty even if I had not seen how blushingly conscious she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
of the eyes of the young fisherman, whom I discovered not far off.
One face, and not an agreeable one, though it was handsome, seemed
maliciously watchful of this pretty girl, and indeed of every one and
everything there. It was a Frenchwoman's.

<p/>As the bell was yet ringing and the great people were not yet come, I
had leisure to glance over the church, which smelt as earthy as a
grave, and to think what a shady, ancient, solemn little church it
was. The windows, heavily shaded by trees, admitted a subdued light
that made the faces around me pale, and darkened the old brasses in
the pavement and the time and damp-worn monuments, and rendered the
sunshine in the little porch, where a monotonous ringer was working
at the bell, inestimably bright. But a stir in that direction, a
gathering of reverential awe in the rustic faces, and a blandly
ferocious assumption on the part of Mr. Boythorn of being resolutely
unconscious of somebody's existence forewarned me that the great
people were come and that the service was going to begin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy
sight--'''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>Shall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart, occasioned by the
look I met as I stood up! Shall I ever forget the manner in which
those handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their languor and
to hold mine! It was only a moment before I cast mine down--released
again, if I may say so--on my book; but I knew the beautiful face
quite well in that short space of time.

<p/>And, very strangely, there was something quickened within me,
associated with the lonely days at my godmother's; yes, away even to
the days when I had stood on tiptoe to dress myself at my little
glass after dressing my doll. And this, although I had never seen
this lady's face before in all my life--I was quite sure of
it--absolutely certain.

<p/>It was easy to know that the ceremonious, gouty, grey-haired
gentleman, the only other occupant of the great pew, was Sir
Leicester Dedlock, and that the lady was Lady Dedlock. But why her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
face should be, in a confused way, like a broken glass to me, in
which I saw scraps of old remembrances, and why I should be so
fluttered and troubled -LRB-for I was still-RRB- by having casually met her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
eyes, I could not think.

<p/>I felt it to be an unmeaning weakness in me and tried to overcome it
by attending to the words I heard. Then, very strangely, I seemed to
hear them, not in the reader's voice, but in the well-remembered
voice of my godmother. This made me think, did Lady Dedlock's face
accidentally resemble my godmother's? It might be that it did, a
little; but the expression was so different, and the stern decision
which had worn into my godmother's face, like weather into rocks, was
so completely wanting in the face before me that it could not be that
resemblance which had struck me. Neither did I know the loftiness and
haughtiness of Lady Dedlock's face, at all, in any one. And yet I--I,
little Esther Summerson, the child who lived a life apart and on
whose birthday there was no rejoicing--seemed to arise before my own
eyes, evoked out of the past by some power in this fashionable lady,
whom I not only entertained no fancy that I had ever seen, but whom I
perfectly well knew I had never seen until that hour.

<p/>It made me tremble so to be thrown into this unaccountable agitation
that I was conscious of being distressed even by the observation of
the French maid, though I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had been looking watchfully here,
and there, and everywhere, from the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) coming into the
church. By degrees, though very slowly, I at last overcame my strange
emotion. After a long time, I looked towards Lady Dedlock again. It
was while they were preparing to sing, before the sermon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) took no
heed of me, and the beating at my heart was gone. Neither did it
revive for more than a few moments when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) once or twice afterwards
glanced at Ada or at me through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) glass.

<p/>The service being concluded, Sir Leicester gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) arm with much
taste and gallantry to Lady Dedlock--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was obliged to walk by
the help of a thick stick--and escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) out of church to the pony
carriage in which they had come. The servants then dispersed, and so
did the congregation, whom Sir Leicester had contemplated all along
-LRB-Mr. Skimpole said to Mr. Boythorn's infinite delight-RRB- as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) were
a considerable landed proprietor in heaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boythorn. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) firmly believes it. So
did his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) father, and his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) grandfather, and his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) great-grandfather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Skimpole very unexpectedly to Mr.
Boythorn, <div class="bookquote">``it's agreeable to me to see a man of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``IS it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boythorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to patronize me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``Very
well! I don't object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boythorn with great vigour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) easy light vein. ``But
that's taking trouble, surely. And why should you take trouble? Here
am I, content to receive things childishly as they fall out, and I
never take trouble! I come down here, for instance, and I find a
mighty potentate exacting homage. Very well! I say ``Mighty potentate,
here IS my homage! It's easier to give it than to withhold it. Here
it is. If you have anything of an agreeable nature to show me, I
shall be happy to see it; if you have anything of an agreeable nature
to give me, I shall be happy to accept it.'' Mighty potentate replies
in effect, ``This is a sensible fellow. I find him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) accord with my
digestion and my bilious system. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doesn't impose upon me the
necessity of rolling myself up like a hedgehog with my points
outward. I expand, I open, I turn my silver lining outward like
Milton's cloud, and it's more agreeable to both of us.<div class="bookquote">'' That's my
view of such things, speaking as a child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Milton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose you went down somewhere else to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Boythorn, <div class="bookquote">``where there was the opposite of that fellow--or of this
fellow. How then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole with an appearance of the utmost
simplicity and candour. ``Just the same then! I should say, <div class="bookquote">``My
esteemed Boythorn'--to make you the personification of our imaginary
friend--`my esteemed Boythorn, you object to the mighty potentate?
Very good. So do I. I take it that my business in the social system
is to be agreeable; I take it that everybody's business in the social
system is to be agreeable. It's a system of harmony, in short.
Therefore if you object, I object. Now, excellent Boythorn, let us go
to dinner!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But excellent Boythorn might say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned our host, swelling and
growing very red, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``Very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--if I WILL go to dinner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Boythorn in a violent burst and
stopping to strike his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) stick upon the ground. ``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) would probably
add, <div class="bookquote">``Is there such a thing as principle, Mr. Harold Skimpole?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To which Harold Skimpole would reply, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) returned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)
gayest manner and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) most ingenuous smile, <div class="bookquote">''`Upon my life I
have not the least idea! I don't know what it is you call by that
name, or where it is, or who possesses it. If you possess it and find
it comfortable, I am quite delighted and congratulate you heartily.
But I know nothing about it, I assure you; for I am a mere child, and
I lay no claim to it, and I don't want it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, you see, excellent
Boythorn and I would go to dinner after all!''

<p/>This was one of many little dialogues between them which I always
expected to end, and which I dare say would have ended under other
circumstances, in some violent explosion on the part of our host. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) had so high a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) hospitable and responsible position as
our entertainer, and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with Mr.
Skimpole, as a child who blew bubbles and broke them all day long,
that matters never went beyond this point. Mr. Skimpole, who always
seemed quite unconscious of having been on delicate ground, then
betook himself to beginning some sketch in the park which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) never
finished, or to playing fragments of airs on the piano, or to singing
scraps of songs, or to lying down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) back under a tree and
looking at the sky--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) couldn't help thinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, was
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was meant for; it suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) so exactly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enterprise and effort,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would say to us -LRB-on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) back-RRB-, ``are
delightful to me. I believe I am truly cosmopolitan. I have the
deepest sympathy with them. I lie in a shady place like this and
think of adventurous spirits going to the North Pole or penetrating
to the heart of the Torrid Zone with admiration. Mercenary creatures
ask, ``What is the use of a man's going to the North Pole? What good
does it do?<div class="bookquote">'' I can't say; but, for anything I CAN say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) may go for
the purpose--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) don't know it--of employing my thoughts as I
lie here. Take an extreme case. Take the case of the slaves on
American plantations. I dare say they are worked hard, I dare say
they don't altogether like it. I dare say theirs is an unpleasant
experience on the whole; but they people the landscape for me, they
give it a poetry for me, and perhaps that is one of the pleasanter
objects of their existence. I am very sensible of it, if it be, and I
shouldn't wonder if it were!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I always wondered on these occasions whether he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) ever thought of Mrs.
Skimpole and the children, and in what point of view they presented
themselves to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) cosmopolitan mind. So far as I could understand,
they rarely presented themselves at all.

<p/>The week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my
heart in the church; and every day had been so bright and blue that
to ramble in the woods, and to see the light striking down among the
transparent leaves and sparkling in the beautiful interlacings of the
shadows of the trees, while the birds poured out their songs and the
air was drowsy with the hum of insects, had been most delightful. We
had one favourite spot, deep in moss and last year's leaves, where
there were some felled trees from which the bark was all stripped
off. Seated among these, we looked through a green vista supported by
thousands of natural columns, the whitened stems of trees, upon a
distant prospect made so radiant by its contrast with the shade in
which we sat and made so precious by the arched perspective through
which we saw it that it was like a glimpse of the better land. Upon
the Saturday we sat here, Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and I, until we heard
thunder muttering in the distance and felt the large raindrops rattle
through the leaves.

<p/>The weather had been all the week extremely sultry, but the storm
broke so suddenly--upon us, at least, in that sheltered spot--that
before we reached the outskirts of the wood the thunder and lightning
were frequent and the rain came plunging through the leaves as if
every drop were a great leaden bead. As it was not a time for
standing among trees, we ran out of the wood, and up and down the
moss-grown steps which crossed the plantation-fence like two
broad-staved ladders placed back to back, and made for a keeper's
lodge which was close at hand. We had often noticed the dark beauty
of this lodge standing in a deep twilight of trees, and how the ivy
clustered over it, and how there was a steep hollow near, where we
had once seen the keeper's dog dive down into the fern as if it were
water.

<p/>The lodge was so dark within, now the sky was overcast, that we only
clearly saw the man who came to the door when we took shelter there
and put two chairs for Ada and me. The lattice-windows were all
thrown open, and we sat just within the doorway watching the storm.
It was grand to see how the wind awoke, and bent the trees, and drove
the rain before it like a cloud of smoke; and to hear the solemn
thunder and to see the lightning; and while thinking with awe of the
tremendous powers by which our little lives are encompassed, to
consider how beneficent they are and how upon the smallest flower and
leaf there was already a freshness poured from all this seeming rage
which seemed to make creation new again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not dangerous to sit in so exposed a place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, Esther dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada quietly.

<p/>Ada said it to me, but I had not spoken.

<p/>The beating of my heart came back again. I had never heard the voice,
as I had never seen the face, but it affected me in the same strange
way. Again, in a moment, there arose before my mind innumerable
pictures of myself.

<p/>Lady Dedlock had taken shelter in the lodge before our arrival there
and had come out of the gloom within. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) stood behind my chair with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand upon it. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand close to my shoulder when I
turned my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have frightened you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) said.

<p/>No. It was not fright. Why should I be frightened!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>said Lady Dedlock to my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``I have the pleasure
of speaking to Mr. Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would,
Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I recognized you in church on Sunday. I am sorry that any local
disputes of Sir Leicester's--they are not of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) seeking, however, I
believe--should render it a matter of some absurd difficulty to show
you any attention here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware of the circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian with a smile,
<div class="bookquote">``and am sufficiently obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand in an indifferent way that seemed habitual
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) and spoke in a correspondingly indifferent manner, though in a
very pleasant voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was as graceful as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was beautiful,
perfectly self-possessed, and had the air, I thought, of being able
to attract and interest any one if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) had thought it worth her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
while. The keeper had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) a chair on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sat in the
middle of the porch between us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the young gentleman disposed of whom you wrote to Sir Leicester
about and whose wishes Sir Leicester was sorry not to have it in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
power to advance in any way?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) said over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shoulder to my
guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) seemed to respect him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) and even to wish to conciliate him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>). There
was something very winning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) haughty manner, and it became more
familiar--I was going to say more easy, but that could hardly be--as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I presume this is your other ward, Miss Clare?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) presented Ada, in form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will lose the disinterested part of your Don Quixote character,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shoulder again, <div class="bookquote">``if you
only redress the wrongs of beauty like this. But present me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
turned full upon me, <div class="bookquote">``to this young lady too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson really is my ward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``I am
responsible to no Lord Chancellor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Miss Summerson lost both her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) parents?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>said my Lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) is very fortunate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Dedlock looked at me, and I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and said I was indeed.
All at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) turned from me with a hasty air, almost expressive of
displeasure or dislike, and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) shoulder again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ages have passed since we were in the habit of meeting, Mr.
Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A long time. At least I thought it was a long time, until I saw you
last Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Even you are a courtier, or think it necessary to become one
to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said with some disdain. <div class="bookquote">``I have achieved that reputation,
I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have achieved so much, Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``that
you pay some little penalty, I dare say. But none to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) repeated, slightly laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) air of superiority, and power, and fascination, and I know
not what, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) seemed to regard Ada and me as little more than
children. So, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) slightly laughed and afterwards sat looking at
the rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was as self-possessed and as free to occupy herself
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own thoughts as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had been alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you knew my sister when we were abroad together better than
you know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we happened to meet oftener,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We went our several ways,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>said Lady Dedlock, <div class="bookquote">``and had little in
common even before we agreed to differ. It is to be regretted, I
suppose, but it could not be helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain. The storm soon began to
pass upon its way. The shower greatly abated, the lightning ceased,
the thunder rolled among the distant hills, and the sun began to
glisten on the wet leaves and the falling rain. As we sat there,
silently, we saw a little pony phaeton coming towards us at a merry
pace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The messenger is coming back, my Lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said the keeper, <div class="bookquote">``with the
carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div><p/>As it drove up, we saw that there were two people inside. There
alighted from it, with some cloaks and wrappers, first the
Frenchwoman whom I had seen in church, and secondly the pretty girl,
the Frenchwoman with a defiant confidence, the pretty girl confused
and hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>said Lady Dedlock. <div class="bookquote">``Two!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am your maid, my Lady, at the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Frenchwoman</b></font>)</div>said the Frenchwoman. <div class="bookquote">``The
message was for the attendant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you might mean me, my Lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the pretty girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did mean you, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) mistress calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Put that shawl
on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) slightly stooped her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shoulders to receive it, and the pretty girl
lightly dropped it in its place. The Frenchwoman stood unnoticed,
looking on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) lips very tightly set.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``that we are not
likely to renew our former acquaintance. You will allow me to send
the carriage back for your two wards. It shall be here directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would on no account accept this offer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) took a graceful
leave of Ada--none of me--and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) proffered arm,
and got into the carriage, which was a little, low, park carriage
with a hood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said to the pretty girl; <div class="bookquote">``I shall want you. Go
on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage rolled away, and the Frenchwoman, with the wrappers she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>)
had brought hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) arm, remained standing where she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) had
alighted.

<p/>I suppose there is nothing pride can so little bear with as pride
itself, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) was punished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) imperious manner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>)
retaliation was the most singular I could have imagined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) remained
perfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive, and
then, without the least discomposure of countenance, slipped off her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>)
shoes, left them on the ground, and walked deliberately in the same
direction through the wettest of the wet grass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that young woman mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said the keeper, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) wife, was looking after
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Hortense is not one of that sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) has as good a head-piece
as the best. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)'s mortal high and passionate--powerful high and
passionate; and what with having notice to leave, and having others
put above her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) don't take kindly to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) walk shoeless through all that water?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my
guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, indeed, sir, unless it is to cool her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) down!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) fancies it's blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)'d as soon
walk through that as anything else, I think, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) own's up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We passed not far from the house a few minutes afterwards. Peaceful
as it had looked when we first saw it, it looked even more so now,
with a diamond spray glittering all about it, a light wind blowing,
the birds no longer hushed but singing strongly, everything refreshed
by the late rain, and the little carriage shining at the doorway like
a fairy carriage made of silver. Still, very steadfastly and quietly
walking towards it, a peaceful figure too in the landscape, went
Mademoiselle Hortense, shoeless, through the wet grass.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX

<p/>Moving On


<p/>It is the long vacation in the regions of Chancery Lane. The good
ships Law and Equity, those teak-built, copper-bottomed,
iron-fastened, brazen-faced, and not by any means fast-sailing
clippers are laid up in ordinary. The Flying Dutchman, with a crew of
ghostly clients imploring all whom they may encounter to peruse their
papers, has drifted, for the time being, heaven knows where. The
courts are all shut up; the public offices lie in a hot sleep.
Westminster Hall itself is a shady solitude where nightingales might
sing, and a tenderer class of suitors than is usually found there,
walk.

<p/>The Temple, Chancery Lane, Serjeants' Inn, and Lincoln's Inn even
unto the Fields are like tidal harbours at low water, where stranded
proceedings, offices at anchor, idle clerks lounging on lop-sided
stools that will not recover their perpendicular until the current of
Term sets in, lie high and dry upon the ooze of the long vacation.
Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score, messages and
parcels are to be left at the Porter's Lodge by the bushel. A crop of
grass would grow in the chinks of the stone pavement outside
Lincoln's Inn Hall, but that the ticket-porters, who have nothing to
do beyond sitting in the shade there, with their white aprons over
their heads to keep the flies off, grub it up and eat it
thoughtfully.

<p/>There is only one judge in town. Even he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) only comes twice a week to
sit in chambers. If the country folks of those assize towns on his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
circuit could see him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) now! No full-bottomed wig, no red petticoats,
no fur, no javelin-men, no white wands. Merely a close-shaved
gentleman in white trousers and a white hat, with sea-bronze on the
judicial countenance, and a strip of bark peeled by the solar rays
from the judicial nose, who calls in at the shell-fish shop as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
comes along and drinks iced ginger-beer!

<p/>The bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth. How
England can get on through four long summer months without its
bar--which is its acknowledged refuge in adversity and its only
legitimate triumph in prosperity--is beside the question; assuredly
that shield and buckler of Britannia are not in present wear. The
learned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the
unprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) client by the
opposite party that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never seems likely to recover it is doing
infinitely better than might be expected in Switzerland. The learned
gentleman who does the withering business and who blights all
opponents with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloomy sarcasm is as merry as a grig at a French
watering-place. The learned gentleman who weeps by the pint on the
smallest provocation has not shed a tear these six weeks. The very
learned gentleman who has cooled the natural heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gingery
complexion in pools and fountains of law until he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has become great in
knotty arguments for term-time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) poses the drowsy bench with
legal <div class="bookquote">``chaff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>inexplicable to the uninitiated and to most of the
initiated too, is roaming, with a characteristic delight in aridity
and dust, about Constantinople. Other dispersed fragments of the same
great palladium are to be found on the canals of Venice, at the
second cataract of the Nile, in the baths of Germany, and sprinkled
on the sea-sand all over the English coast. Scarcely one is to be
encountered in the deserted region of Chancery Lane. If such a lonely
member of the bar do flit across the waste and come upon a prowling
suitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) anxiety,
they frighten one another and retreat into opposite shades.

<p/>It is the hottest long vacation known for many years. All the young
clerks are madly in love, and according to their various degrees,
pine for bliss with the beloved object, at Margate, Ramsgate, or
Gravesend. All the middle-aged clerks think their families too large.
All the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court and pant about
staircases and other dry places seeking water give short howls of
aggravation. All the blind men's dogs in the streets draw their
masters against pumps or trip them over buckets. A shop with a
sun-blind, and a watered pavement, and a bowl of gold and silver fish
in the window, is a sanctuary. Temple Bar gets so hot that it is, to
the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street, what a heater is in an urn, and
keeps them simmering all night.

<p/>There are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be
cool, if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in
dullness; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those
retirements seem to blaze. In Mr. Krook's court, it is so hot that
the people turn their houses inside out and sit in chairs upon the
pavement--Mr. Krook included, who there pursues his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) studies, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
cat -LRB-who never is too hot-RRB- by his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) side. The Sol's Arms has
discontinued the Harmonic Meetings for the season, and Little Swills
is engaged at the Pastoral Gardens down the river, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) comes out
in quite an innocent manner and sings comic ditties of a juvenile
complexion calculated -LRB-as the bill says-RRB- not to wound the feelings of
the most fastidious mind.

<p/>Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs, like some great veil of
rust or gigantic cobweb, the idleness and pensiveness of the long
vacation. Mr. Snagsby, law-stationer of Cook's Court, Cursitor
Street, is sensible of the influence not only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) mind as a
sympathetic and contemplative man, but also in his (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) business as a
law-stationer aforesaid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn
and in the Rolls Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) says to the two `prentices, what a thing it is in such hot
weather to think that you live in an island with the sea a-rolling
and a-bowling right round you.

<p/>Guster is busy in the little drawing-room on this present afternoon
in the long vacation, when Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have it in
contemplation to receive company. The expected guests are rather
select than numerous, being Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and no more. From
Mr. Chadband's being much given to describe himself, both verbally
and in writing, as a vessel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) is occasionally mistaken by strangers
for a gentleman connected with navigation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) is, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) expresses
it, <div class="bookquote">``in the ministry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Chadband is attached to no particular
denomination and is considered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) persecutors to have nothing so
very remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
volunteering, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) own account, at all incumbent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) conscience;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) followers, and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number. Mrs.
Snagsby has but recently taken a passage upward by the vessel,
Chadband; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) attention was attracted to that Bark A 1, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
was something flushed by the hot weather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby to the sparrows in Staple Inn,
<div class="bookquote">``likes to have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) religion rather sharp, you see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>So Guster, much impressed by regarding herself for the time as the
handmaid of Chadband, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) knows to be endowed with the gift of
holding forth for four hours at a stretch, prepares the little
drawing-room for tea. All the furniture is shaken and dusted, the
portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are touched up with a wet cloth,
the best tea-service is set forth, and there is excellent provision
made of dainty new bread, crusty twists, cool fresh butter, thin
slices of ham, tongue, and German sausage, and delicate little rows
of anchovies nestling in parsley, not to mention new-laid eggs, to be
brought up warm in a napkin, and hot buttered toast. For Chadband is
rather a consuming vessel--the persecutors say a gorging vessel--and
can wield such weapons of the flesh as a knife and fork remarkably
well.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) best coat, looking at all the preparations when
they are completed and coughing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of deference behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
hand, says to Mrs. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``At what time did you expect Mr. and Mrs.
Chadband, my love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At six,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby observes in a mild and casual way that <div class="bookquote">``it's gone that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you'd like to begin without them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>is Mrs. Snagsby's
reproachful remark.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby does look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) would like it very much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) says,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of mildness, <div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, no. I merely named the
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``to eternity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby. <div class="bookquote">``Only when a person lays in
victuals for tea, a person does it with a view--perhaps--more to
time. And when a time is named for having tea, it's better to come up
to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To come up to it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity. <div class="bookquote">``Up to it! As
if Mr. Chadband was a fighter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby.

<p/>Here, Guster, who had been looking out of the bedroom window, comes
rustling and scratching down the little staircase like a popular
ghost, and falling flushed into the drawing-room, announces that Mr.
and Mrs. Chadband have appeared in the court. The bell at the inner
door in the passage immediately thereafter tinkling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) is
admonished by Mrs. Snagsby, on pain of instant reconsignment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
patron saint, not to omit the ceremony of announcement. Much
discomposed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) nerves -LRB-which were previously in the best order-RRB-
by this threat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) so fearfully mutilates that point of state as to
announce <div class="bookquote">``Mr. and Mrs. Cheeseming, least which, Imeantersay,
whatsername!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and retires conscience-stricken from the presence.

<p/>Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man with a fat smile and a general
appearance of having a good deal of train oil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) system. Mrs.
Chadband is a stern, severe-looking, silent woman. Mr. Chadband moves
softly and cumbrously, not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk
upright. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) is very much embarrassed about the arms, as if they were
inconvenient to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) wanted to grovel, is very much in a
perspiration about the head, and never speaks without first putting
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) great hand, as delivering a token to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) hearers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) is
going to edify them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``peace be on this house! On the
master thereof, on the mistress thereof, on the young maidens, and on
the young men! My friends, why do I wish for peace? What is peace? Is
it war? No. Is it strife? No. Is it lovely, and gentle, and
beautiful, and pleasant, and serene, and joyful? Oh, yes! Therefore,
my friends, I wish for peace, upon you and upon yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply edified, Mr. Snagsby
thinks it expedient on the whole to say amen, which is well received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>proceeds Mr. Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``since I am upon this
theme--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>Guster presents herself. Mrs. Snagsby, in a spectral bass voice and
without removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eyes from Chadband, says with dreadful
distinctness, <div class="bookquote">``Go away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``since I am upon this theme, and in
my lowly path improving it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div><p/>Guster is heard unaccountably to murmur <div class="bookquote">``one thousing seven hundred
and eighty-two.''  (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div>The spectral voice repeats more solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``Go away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``we will inquire in a spirit of
love--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>Still Guster reiterates <div class="bookquote">``one thousing seven hundred and eighty-two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Chadband, pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be
persecuted and languidly folding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) chin into his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) fat smile,
says, <div class="bookquote">``Let us hear the maiden! Speak, maiden!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One thousing seven hundred and eighty-two, if you please, sir. Which
he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wish to know what the shilling ware for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div>says Guster, breathless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>returns Mrs. Chadband. <div class="bookquote">``For his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) fare!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div><p/>Guster replied that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) insistes on one and eightpence or on
summonsizzing the party.''  (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Snagsby and Mrs. Chadband are
proceeding to grow shrill in indignation when Mr. Chadband quiets the
tumult by lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I remember a duty unfulfilled yesterday. It
is right that I should be chastened in some penalty. I ought not to
murmur. Rachael, pay the eightpence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While Mrs. Snagsby, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) breath, looks hard at Mr. Snagsby, as
who should say, <div class="bookquote">``You hear this apostle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>and while Mr. Chadband glows
with humility and train oil, Mrs. Chadband pays the money. It is Mr.
Chadband's habit--it is the head and front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) pretensions
indeed--to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the
smallest items and to post it publicly on the most trivial occasions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``eightpence is not much; it might justly
have been one and fourpence; it might justly have been half a crown.
O let us be joyful, joyful! O let us be joyful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>With which remark, which appears from its sound to be an extract in
verse, Mr. Chadband stalks to the table, and before taking a chair,
lifts up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) admonitory hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what is this which we now behold as being
spread before us? Refreshment. Do we need refreshment then, my
friends? We do. And why do we need refreshment, my friends? Because
we are but mortal, because we are but sinful, because we are but of
the earth, because we are not of the air. Can we fly, my friends? We
cannot. Why can we not fly, my friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby, presuming on the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) last point, ventures to
observe in a cheerful and rather knowing tone, <div class="bookquote">``No wings.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>But is
immediately frowned down by Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>pursues Mr. Chadband, utterly rejecting and
obliterating Mr. Snagsby's suggestion, <div class="bookquote">``why can we not fly? Is it
because we are calculated to walk? It is. Could we walk, my friends,
without strength? We could not. What should we do without strength,
my friends? Our legs would refuse to bear us, our knees would double
up, our ankles would turn over, and we should come to the ground.
Then from whence, my friends, in a human point of view, do we derive
the strength that is necessary to our limbs? Is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Chadband,
glancing over the table, <div class="bookquote">``from bread in various forms, from butter
which is churned from the milk which is yielded unto us by the cow,
from the eggs which are laid by the fowl, from ham, from tongue, from
sausage, and from such like? It is. Then let us partake of the good
things which are set before us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The persecutors</b></font>)</div><p/>The persecutors denied that there was any particular gift in Mr.
Chadband's piling verbose flights of stairs, one upon another, after
this fashion. But this can only be received as a proof of their
determination to persecute, since it must be within everybody's
experience that the Chadband style of oratory is widely received and
much admired.

<p/>Mr. Chadband, however, having concluded for the present, sits down at
Mr. Snagsby's table and lays about him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) prodigiously. The conversion
of nutriment of any sort into oil of the quality already mentioned
appears to be a process so inseparable from the constitution of this
exemplary vessel that in beginning to eat and drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) may be
described as always becoming a kind of considerable oil mills or
other large factory for the production of that article on a wholesale
scale. On the present evening of the long vacation, in Cook's Court,
Cursitor Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) does such a powerful stroke of business that the
warehouse appears to be quite full when the works cease.

<p/>At this period of the entertainment, Guster, who has never recovered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) first failure, but has neglected no possible or impossible means
of bringing the establishment and herself into contempt--among which
may be briefly enumerated her (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) unexpectedly performing clashing
military music on Mr. Chadband's head with plates, and afterwards
crowning that gentleman with muffins--at which period of the
entertainment, Guster whispers Mr. Snagsby that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And being wanted in the--not to put too fine a point upon it--in the
shop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, rising, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps this good company will
excuse me for half a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby descends and finds the two `prentices intently
contemplating a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, bless my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``what's the matter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>says the constable, <div class="bookquote">``although he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s repeatedly told to,
won't move on--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm always a-moving on, sar,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>cries the boy, wiping away his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) grimy
tears with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``I've always been a-moving and a-moving on, ever
since I was born. Where can I possibly move to, sir, more nor I do
move!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sar</b></font>) won't move on,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the constable calmly, with a slight
professional hitch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) neck involving its better settlement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
stiff stock, ``although he (<font color='blue'><b>sar</b></font>) has been repeatedly cautioned, and
therefore I am obliged to take him (<font color='blue'><b>sar</b></font>) into custody. He (<font color='blue'><b>sar</b></font>)'s as obstinate a
young gonoph as I know. He (<font color='blue'><b>sar</b></font>) WON<div class="bookquote">``T move on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my eye! Where can I move to!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cries the boy, clutching quite
desperately at his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hair and beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) bare feet upon the floor of
Mr. Snagsby's passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you come none of that or I shall make blessed short work of
you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>says the constable, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) a passionless shake. <div class="bookquote">``My
instructions are that you are to move on. I have told you so five
hundred times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cries the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Really, constable, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby wistfully, and
coughing behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of great perplexity and doubt,
<div class="bookquote">``really, that does seem a question. Where, you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My instructions don't go to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>replies the constable. <div class="bookquote">``My
instructions are that this boy is to move on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Do you hear, Jo? It is nothing to you or to any one else that the
great lights of the parliamentary sky have failed for some few years
in this business to set you the example of moving on. The one grand
recipe remains for you--the profound philosophical prescription--the
be-all and the end-all of your strange existence upon earth. Move on!
You are by no means to move off, Jo, for the great lights can't at
all agree about that. Move on!

<p/>Mr. Snagsby says nothing to this effect, says nothing at all indeed,
but coughs his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) forlornest cough, expressive of no thoroughfare in any
direction. By this time Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and Mrs. Snagsby,
hearing the altercation, have appeared upon the stairs. Guster having
never left the end of the passage, the whole household are assembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The simple question is, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>says the constable, <div class="bookquote">``whether you know
this boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) elevation, instantly cries out, <div class="bookquote">``No he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lit-tle woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, looking up the staircase. <div class="bookquote">``My
love, permit me! Pray have a moment's patience, my dear. I do know
something of this lad, and in what I know of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), I can't say that
there's any harm; perhaps on the contrary, constable.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>To whom the
law-stationer relates his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) Joful and woeful experience, suppressing
the half-crown fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>says the constable, <div class="bookquote">``so far, it seems, he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had grounds for
what he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) said. When I took him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) into custody up in Holborn, he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) said you
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>). Upon that, a young man who was in the crowd said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
acquainted with you, and you were a respectable housekeeper, and if
I'd call and make the inquiry, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d appear. The young man don't seem
inclined to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word, but--Oh! Here IS the young man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div><p/>Enter Mr. Guppy, who nods to Mr. Snagsby and touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hat with the
chivalry of clerkship to the ladies on the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was strolling away from the office just now when I found this row
going on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy to the law-stationer, <div class="bookquote">``and as your name was
mentioned, I thought it was right the thing should be looked into.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very good-natured of you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``and I am
obliged to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Snagsby again relates his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) experience, again
suppressing the half-crown fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I know where you live,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>says the constable, then, to Jo. <div class="bookquote">``You
live down in Tom-all-Alone's. That's a nice innocent place to live
in, ain't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't go and live in no nicer place, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replies Jo. <div class="bookquote">``They

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very poor, ain't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>says the constable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am indeed, sir, wery poor in gin`ral,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replies Jo. <div class="bookquote">``I leave

constable, producing them to the company, <div class="bookquote">``in only putting my hand
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're wot's left, Mr. Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, <div class="bookquote">``out of a sov-ring as wos

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the
sovereign, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>says the constable, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) aside with
ineffable disdain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as I do, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replies Jo. <div class="bookquote">``I don't expect nothink at
all, sir, much, but that's the true hist`ry on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>the constable observes to the audience. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
Mr. Snagsby, if I don't lock him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) up this time, will you engage for

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>pleads her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Constable, I have no doubt

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm everyways agreeable, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says the hapless Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do it, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>observes the constable. <div class="bookquote">``You know what you have got to
do. Do it! And recollect you won't get off so easy next time. Catch
hold of your money. Now, the sooner you're five mile off, the better
for all parties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>auditors</b></font>)</div><p/>With this farewell hint and pointing generally to the setting sun as
a likely place to move on to, the constable bids his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) auditors good
afternoon and makes the echoes of Cook's Court perform slow music for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) walks away on the shady side, carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) iron-bound hat
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand for a little ventilation.

<p/>Now, Jo's improbable story concerning the lady and the sovereign has
awakened more or less the curiosity of all the company. Mr. Guppy,
who has an inquiring mind in matters of evidence and who has
been suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation,
takes that interest in the case that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) enters on a regular
cross-examination of the witness, which is found so interesting by
the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) to step upstairs
and drink a cup of tea, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) will excuse the disarranged state of
the tea-table, consequent on their previous exertions. Mr. Guppy
yielding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) assent to this proposal, Jo is requested to follow into
the drawing-room doorway, where Mr. Guppy takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) in hand as a
witness, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) into this shape, that shape, and the other shape
like a butterman dealing with so much butter, and worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
according to the best models. Nor is the examination unlike many such
model displays, both in respect of its eliciting nothing and of its
being lengthy, for Mr. Guppy is sensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) talent, and Mrs.
Snagsby feels not only that it gratifies her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) inquisitive disposition,
but that it lifts her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) husband's establishment higher up in the law.
During the progress of this keen encounter, the vessel Chadband,
being merely engaged in the oil trade, gets aground and waits to be
floated off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Either this boy sticks to it like
cobbler's-wax or there is something out of the common here that beats
anything that ever came into my way at Kenge and Carboy's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby, who exclaims, <div class="bookquote">``You don't say
so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For years!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Chadband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has known Kenge and Carboy's office for years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Snagsby
triumphantly explains to Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Chadband--this gentleman's
wife--Reverend Mr. Chadband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before I married my present husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Chadband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was you a party in anything, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, transferring
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) cross-examination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``NOT a party in anything, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy.

<p/>Mrs. Chadband shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in
something, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, who likes nothing better than to
model his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) conversation on forensic principles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly that, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>replies Mrs. Chadband, humouring the joke
with a hard-favoured smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly that, either!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Very good. Pray,
ma'am, was it a lady of your acquaintance who had some transactions
-LRB-we will not at present say what transactions-RRB- with Kenge and
Carboy's office, or was it a gentleman of your acquaintance? Take

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Chadband as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! A child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby
the regular acute professional eye which is thrown on British
jurymen. <div class="bookquote">``Now, ma'am, perhaps you'll have the kindness to tell us
WHAT child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have got it at last, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Chadband with another
hard-favoured smile. <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, it was before your time, most
likely, judging from your appearance. I was left in charge of a child
named Esther Summerson, who was put out in life by Messrs. Kenge and
Carboy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson, ma'am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Guppy, excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I call her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) Esther Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Chadband with austerity.
``There was no Miss-ing of the girl in my time. It was Esther.
``Esther, do this! Esther, do that!<div class="bookquote">'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) was made to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Miss Summerson/Esther Summerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Guppy, moving across the small
apartment, <div class="bookquote">``the humble individual who now addresses you received that
young lady in London when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first came here from the establishment
to which you have alluded. Allow me to have the pleasure of taking
you by the hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Chadband, at last seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) opportunity, makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) accustomed
signal and rises with a smoking head, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) dabs with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief. Mrs. Snagsby whispers <div class="bookquote">``Hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``we have partaken in moderation''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which
was certainly not the case so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) was concerned-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``of the
comforts which have been provided for us. May this house live upon
the fatness of the land; may corn and wine be plentiful therein; may
it grow, may it thrive, may it prosper, may it advance, may it
proceed, may it press forward! But, my friends, have we partaken of
anything else? We have. My friends, of what else have we partaken? Of
spiritual profit? Yes. From whence have we derived that spiritual
profit? My young friend, stand forth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo, thus apostrophized, gives a slouch backward, and another slouch
forward, and another slouch to each side, and confronts the eloquent
Chadband with evident doubts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) intentions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``you are to us a pearl, you are to
us a diamond, you are to us a gem, you are to us a jewel. And why, my
young friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replies Jo. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``it is because you know nothing
that you are to us a gem and jewel. For what are you, my young
friend? Are you a beast of the field? No. A bird of the air? No. A
fish of the sea or river? No. You are a human boy, my young friend. A
human boy. O glorious to be a human boy! And why glorious, my young
friend? Because you are capable of receiving the lessons of wisdom,
because you are capable of profiting by this discourse which I now
deliver for your good, because you are not a stick, or a staff, or a
stock, or a stone, or a post, or a pillar.

<p/>O running stream of sparkling joy
To be a soaring human boy!

<p/>And do you cool yourself in that stream now, my young friend? No.
Why do you not cool yourself in that stream now? Because you are in a
state of darkness, because you are in a state of obscurity, because
you are in a state of sinfulness, because you are in a state of
bondage. My young friend, what is bondage? Let us, in a spirit of
love, inquire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>At this threatening stage of the discourse, Jo, who seems to have
been gradually going out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) mind, smears his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) right arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
face and gives a terrible yawn. Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses
her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) is a limb of the arch-fiend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Chadband with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) persecuted chin folding
itself into its fat smile again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) looks round, <div class="bookquote">``it is right that
I should be humbled, it is right that I should be tried, it is right
that I should be mortified, it is right that I should be corrected. I
stumbled, on Sabbath last, when I thought with pride of my three
hours' improving. The account is now favourably balanced: my creditor
has accepted a composition. O let us be joyful, joyful! O let us be
joyful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Great sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) in conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``I will
not proceed with my young friend now. Will you come to-morrow, my
young friend, and inquire of this good lady where I am to be found to
deliver a discourse unto you, and will you come like the thirsty
swallow upon the next day, and upon the day after that, and upon the
day after that, and upon many pleasant days, to hear discourses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-This with a cow-like lightness.-RRB-

<p/>Jo, whose immediate object seems to be to get away on any terms,
gives a shuffling nod. Mr. Guppy then throws him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) a penny, and Mrs.
Snagsby calls to Guster to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) safely out of the house. But
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) goes downstairs, Mr. Snagsby loads him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) with some broken
meats from the table, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) carries away, hugging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) arms.

<p/>So, Mr. Chadband--of whom the persecutors say that it is no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
should go on for any length of time uttering such abominable
nonsense, but that the wonder rather is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) should ever leave
off, having once the audacity to begin--retires into private life
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) invests a little capital of supper in the oil-trade. Jo
moves on, through the long vacation, down to Blackfriars Bridge,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) finds a baking stony corner wherein to settle to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) repast.

<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) sits, munching and gnawing, and looking up at the great
cross on the summit of St. Paul's Cathedral, glittering above a
red-and-violet-tinted cloud of smoke. From the boy's face one might
suppose that sacred emblem to be, in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, the crowning confusion
of the great, confused city--so golden, so high up, so far out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
reach. There he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sits, the sun going down, the river running fast, the
crowd flowing by him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in two streams--everything moving on to some
purpose and to one end--until he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is stirred up and told to <div class="bookquote">``move on''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>too.




<p/>CHAPTER XX

<p/>A New Lodger


<p/>The long vacation saunters on towards term-time like an idle river
very leisurely strolling down a flat country to the sea. Mr. Guppy
saunters along with it congenially. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has blunted the blade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
penknife and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) desk in every direction. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) bears the desk any ill will,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) must do something, and it must be something of an unexciting
nature, which will lay neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) physical nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) intellectual
energies under too heavy contribution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) finds that nothing agrees
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) so well as to make little gyrations on one leg of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) stool,
and stab his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) desk, and gape.

<p/>Kenge and Carboy are out of town, and the articled clerk has taken
out a shooting license and gone down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) father's, and Mr. Guppy's
two fellow-stipendiaries are away on leave. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard
Carstone divide the dignity of the office. But Mr. Carstone is for
the time being established in Kenge's room, whereat Mr. Guppy chafes.
So exceedingly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) with biting sarcasm informs his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mother, in the
confidential moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) sups with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off a lobster and lettuce
in the Old Street Road, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is afraid the office is hardly good
enough for swells, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) had known there was a swell coming,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) would have got it painted.

<p/>Mr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool
in Kenge and Carboy's office of entertaining, as a matter of course,
sinister designs upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is clear that every such person wants
to depose him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) be ever asked how, why, when, or wherefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
shuts up one eye and shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head. On the strength of these
profound views, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains
to counterplot when there is no plot, and plays the deepest games of
chess without any adversary.

<p/>It is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy, therefore, to find
the new-comer constantly poring over the papers in Jarndyce and
Jarndyce, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) well knows that nothing but confusion and failure
can come of that. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) satisfaction communicates itself to a third
saunterer through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy's office, to
wit, Young Smallweed.

<p/>Whether Young Smallweed -LRB-metaphorically called Small and eke Chick
Weed, as it were jocularly to express a fledgling-RRB- was ever a boy is
much doubted in Lincoln's Inn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) is now something under fifteen and
an old limb of the law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) is facetiously understood to entertain a
passion for a lady at a cigar-shop in the neighbourhood of Chancery
Lane and for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sake to have broken off a contract with another
lady, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) had been engaged some years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) is a town-made
article, of small stature and weazen features, but may be perceived
from a considerable distance by means of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) very tall hat. To become
a Guppy is the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) ambition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) dresses at that gentleman
-LRB-by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) is patronized-RRB-, talks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>), walks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>), founds
himself entirely on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) is honoured with Mr. Guppy's particular
confidence and occasionally advises him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), from the deep wells of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
experience, on difficult points in private life.

<p/>Mr. Guppy has been lolling out of window all the morning after trying
all the stools in succession and finding none of them easy, and after
several times putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head into the iron safe with a notion of
cooling it. Mr. Smallweed has been twice dispatched for effervescent
drinks, and has twice mixed them in the two official tumblers and
stirred them up with the ruler. Mr. Guppy propounds for Mr.
Smallweed's consideration the paradox that the more you drink the
thirstier you are and reclines his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head upon the window-sill in a
state of hopeless languor.

<p/>While thus looking out into the shade of Old Square, Lincoln's Inn,
surveying the intolerable bricks and mortar, Mr. Guppy becomes
conscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below
and turning itself up in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) face. At the same time,
a low whistle is wafted through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries,
<div class="bookquote">``Hip! Gup-py!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't mean it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, aroused. <div class="bookquote">``Small! Here's
Jobling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Small</b></font>)</div>Small's head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you sprung up from?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>inquires Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From the market-gardens down by Deptford. I can't stand it any
longer. I must enlist. I say! I wish you'd lend me half a crown. Upon
my soul, I'm hungry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Jobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to
seed in the market-gardens down by Deptford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say! Just throw out half a crown if you have got one to spare. I
want to get some dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come and dine with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, throwing out the
coin, which Mr. Jobling catches neatly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long should I have to hold out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Jobling.

<p/>``Not half an hour. I am only waiting here till the enemy goes,
returns Mr. Guppy, butting inward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What enemy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A new one. Going to be articled. Will you wait?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Jobling.

<p/>Smallweed suggests the law list. But Mr. Jobling declares with much
earnestness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``can't stand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have the paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) shall bring it down.
But you had better not be seen about here. Sit on our staircase and
read. It's a quiet place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Jobling nods intelligence and acquiescence. The sagacious Smallweed
supplies him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) with the newspaper and occasionally drops his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) eye upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) from the landing as a precaution against his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) becoming disgusted
with waiting and making an untimely departure. At last the enemy
retreats, and then Smallweed fetches Mr. Jobling up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, so. How are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy replying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is not much to boast of, Mr. Jobling
ventures on the question, <div class="bookquote">``How is SHE?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>This Mr. Guppy resents as a
liberty, retorting, <div class="bookquote">``Jobling, there ARE chords in the human mind--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Jobling begs pardon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any subject but that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy with a gloomy enjoyment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
injury. <div class="bookquote">``For there ARE chords, Jobling--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jobling begs pardon again.

<p/>During this short colloquy, the active Smallweed, who is of the
dinner party, has written in legal characters on a slip of paper,
<div class="bookquote">``Return immediately.''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>This notification to all whom it may concern,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) inserts in the letter-box, and then putting on the tall hat at the
angle of inclination at which Mr. Guppy wears his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), informs his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) patron
that they may now make themselves scarce.

<p/>Accordingly they betake themselves to a neighbouring dining-house, of
the class known among its frequenters by the denomination slap-bang,
where the waitress, a bouncing young female of forty, is supposed to
have made some impression on the susceptible Smallweed, of whom it
may be remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is a weird changeling to whom years are
nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) stands precociously possessed of centuries of owlish
wisdom. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) ever lay in a cradle, it seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) must have lain
there in a tail-coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has an old, old eye, has Smallweed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
drinks and smokes in a monkeyish way; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) neck is stiff in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
collar; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is never to be taken in; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) knows all about it,
whatever it is. In short, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) bringing up he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has been so nursed by
Law and Equity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has become a kind of fossil imp, to account
for whose terrestrial existence it is reported at the public offices
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) father was John Doe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mother the only female member of
the Roe family, also that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) first long-clothes were made from a
blue bag.

<p/>Into the dining-house, unaffected by the seductive show in the window
of artificially whitened cauliflowers and poultry, verdant baskets of
peas, coolly blooming cucumbers, and joints ready for the spit, Mr.
Smallweed leads the way. They know him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) there and defer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) has
his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) favourite box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) bespeaks all the papers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is down upon bald
patriarchs, who keep them more than ten minutes afterwards. It is of
no use trying him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) with anything less than a full-sized <div class="bookquote">``bread''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or
proposing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) any joint in cut unless it is in the very best cut.
In the matter of gravy he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is adamant.

<p/>Conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) elfin power and submitting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) dread experience,
Mr. Guppy consults him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) in the choice of that day's banquet, turning
an appealing look towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) as the waitress repeats the catalogue
of viands and saying <div class="bookquote">``What do YOU take, Chick?''  (<font color='red'><b>the waitress</b></font>)</div>Chick, out of the
profundity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) artfulness, preferring <div class="bookquote">``veal and ham and French
beans--and don't you forget the stuffing, Polly''  (<font color='red'><b>Chick</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with an unearthly
cock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) venerable eye-RRB-, Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling give the like
order. Three pint pots of half-and-half are superadded. Quickly the
waitress returns bearing what is apparently a model of the Tower of
Babel but what is really a pile of plates and flat tin dish-covers.
Mr. Smallweed, approving of what is set before him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>), conveys
intelligent benignity into his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) ancient eye and winks upon her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>). Then,
amid a constant coming in, and going out, and running about, and a
clatter of crockery, and a rumbling up and down of the machine which
brings the nice cuts from the kitchen, and a shrill crying for more
nice cuts down the speaking-pipe, and a shrill reckoning of the cost
of nice cuts that have been disposed of, and a general flush and
steam of hot joints, cut and uncut, and a considerably heated
atmosphere in which the soiled knives and tablecloths seem to break
out spontaneously into eruptions of grease and blotches of beer, the
legal triumvirate appease their appetites.

<p/>Mr. Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) hat presents at the rims a peculiar appearance of a glistening
nature, as if it had been a favourite snail-promenade. The same
phenomenon is visible on some parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) coat, and particularly at
the seams. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed
circumstances; even his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) light whiskers droop with something of a
shabby air.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) appetite is so vigorous that it suggests spare living for some
little time back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) makes such a speedy end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) plate of veal and
ham, bringing it to a close while his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) companions are yet midway in
theirs, that Mr. Guppy proposes another. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Jobling, <div class="bookquote">``I really don't know but what I WILL take another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Another being brought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) falls to with great goodwill.

<p/>Mr. Guppy takes silent notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) at intervals until he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is half
way through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) pint pot of half-and-half -LRB-also renewed-RRB- and stretches out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
legs and rubs his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hands. Beholding him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) in which glow of contentment,
Mr. Guppy says, <div class="bookquote">``You are a man again, Tony!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not quite yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling. <div class="bookquote">``Say, just born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take any other vegetables? Grass? Peas? Summer cabbage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling. <div class="bookquote">``I really don't know but what I
WILL take summer cabbage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Order given; with the sarcastic addition -LRB-from Mr. Smallweed-RRB- of
<div class="bookquote">``Without slugs, Polly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>And cabbage produced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am growing up, Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling, plying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) knife and fork
with a relishing steadiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In fact, I have just turned into my teens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) says no more until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) has performed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) task, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) achieves as
Messrs. Guppy and Smallweed finish theirs, thus getting over the
ground in excellent style and beating those two gentlemen easily by a
veal and ham and a cabbage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Small,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``what would you recommend about
pastry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marrow puddings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Smallweed instantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Jobling with an arch look. <div class="bookquote">``You're there, are
you? Thank you, Mr. Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take a marrow
pudding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Three marrow puddings being produced, Mr. Jobling adds in a pleasant
humour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) is coming of age fast. To these succeed, by command of
Mr. Smallweed, <div class="bookquote">``three Cheshires,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>and to those <div class="bookquote">``three small rums.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>This apex of the entertainment happily reached, Mr. Jobling puts up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) legs on the carpeted seat -LRB-having his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) own side of the box to
himself-RRB-, leans against the wall, and says, <div class="bookquote">``I am grown up now,
Guppy. I have arrived at maturity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``about--you don't mind
Smallweed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least in the world. I have the pleasure of drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) good
health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was saying, what do you think NOW,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>pursues Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``of
enlisting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what I may think after dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Jobling, <div class="bookquote">``is one
thing, my dear Guppy, and what I may think before dinner is another
thing. Still, even after dinner, I ask myself the question, What am I
to do? How am I to live? Ill fo manger, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling,
pronouncing that word as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) meant a necessary fixture in an
English stable. <div class="bookquote">``Ill fo manger. That's the French saying, and
mangering is as necessary to me as it is to a Frenchman. Or more so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed is decidedly of opinion <div class="bookquote">``much more so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If any man had told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>pursues Jobling, <div class="bookquote">``even so lately as when
you and I had the frisk down in Lincolnshire, Guppy, and drove over
to see that house at Castle Wold--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed corrects him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)--Chesney Wold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chesney Wold. -LRB-I thank my honourable friend for that cheer.-RRB- If any
man had told me then that I should be as hard up at the present time
as I literally find myself, I should have--well, I should have
pitched into him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling, taking a little rum-and-water
with an air of desperate resignation; <div class="bookquote">``I should have let fly at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, Tony, you were on the wrong side of the post then,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>remonstrates Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``You were talking about nothing else in the
gig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling, <div class="bookquote">``I will not deny it. I was on the wrong
side of the post. But I trusted to things coming round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>That very popular trust in flat things coming round! Not in their
being beaten round, or worked round, but in their <div class="bookquote">``coming''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>round! As
though a lunatic should trust in the world's <div class="bookquote">``coming''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>triangular!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had confident expectations that things would come round and be all
square,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling with some vagueness of expression and
perhaps of meaning too. <div class="bookquote">``But I was disappointed. They never did. And
when it came to creditors making rows at the office and to people
that the office dealt with making complaints about dirty trifles of
borrowed money, why there was an end of that connexion. And of any
new professional connexion too, for if I was to give a reference
to-morrow, it would be mentioned and would sew me up. Then what's a
fellow to do? I have been keeping out of the way and living cheap
down about the market-gardens, but what's the use of living cheap
when you have got no money? You might as well live dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Smallweed thinks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. It's the fashionable way; and fashion and whiskers have
been my weaknesses, and I don't care who knows it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling.
<div class="bookquote">``They are great weaknesses--Damme, sir, they are great. Well,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>proceeds Mr. Jobling after a defiant visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) rum-and-water,
<div class="bookquote">``what can a fellow do, I ask you, BUT enlist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy comes more fully into the conversation to state what, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) opinion, a fellow can do. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) manner is the gravely impressive
manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jobling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``myself and our mutual friend Smallweed--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed modestly observes, <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen both!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>and drinks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--Have had a little conversation on this matter more than once since
you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, got the sack!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Jobling bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Say it, Guppy. You
mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No-o-o! Left the Inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you left the Inn, Jobling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy; <div class="bookquote">``and I have
mentioned to our mutual friend Smallweed a plan I have lately thought
of proposing. You know Snagsby the stationer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know there is such a stationer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Jobling. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) was not
ours, and I am not acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) IS ours, Jobling, and I AM acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy
retorts. <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir! I have lately become better acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>)
through some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of
his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) in private life. Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer
in argument. They may--or they may not--have some reference to a
subject which may--or may not--have cast its shadow on my existence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>As it is Mr. Guppy's perplexing way with boastful misery to tempt his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
particular friends into this subject, and the moment they touch it,
to turn on them with that trenchant severity about the chords in the
human mind, both Mr. Jobling and Mr. Smallweed decline the pitfall by
remaining silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such things may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``or they may not be. They
are no part of the case. It is enough to mention that both Mr. and
Mrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has, in
busy times, a good deal of copying work to give out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has all
Tulkinghorn's, and an excellent business besides. I believe if our
mutual friend Smallweed were put into the box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) could prove this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed nods and appears greedy to be sworn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, gentlemen of the jury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">''--I mean, now,
Jobling--you may say this is a poor prospect of a living. Granted.
But it's better than nothing, and better than enlistment. You want
time. There must be time for these late affairs to blow over. You
might live through it on much worse terms than by writing for
Snagsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jobling is about to interrupt when the sagacious Smallweed checks
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) with a dry cough and the words, <div class="bookquote">``Hem! Shakspeare!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two branches to this subject, Jobling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy.
<div class="bookquote">``That is the first. I come to the second. You know Krook, the
Chancellor, across the lane. Come, Jobling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
encouraging cross-examination-tone, <div class="bookquote">``I think you know Krook, the
Chancellor, across the lane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) by sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know him (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) by sight. Very well. And you know little Flite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>). VERY well. Now it has been one of my duties of
late to pay Flite a certain weekly allowance, deducting from it the
amount of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) weekly rent, which I have paid -LRB-in consequence of
instructions I have received-RRB- to Krook himself, regularly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>)
presence. This has brought me into communication with Krook and into
a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) house and his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) habits. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) has a room to let.
You may live there at a very low charge under any name you like, as
quietly as if you were a hundred miles off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)'ll ask no questions
and would accept you as a tenant at a word from me--before the clock
strikes, if you chose. And I tell you another thing, Jobling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says
Mr. Guppy, who has suddenly lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) voice and become familiar
again, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>)'s an extraordinary old chap--always rummaging among a
litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and
write, without getting on a bit, as it seems to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) is a most
extraordinary old chap, sir. I don't know but what it might be worth
a fellow's while to look him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jobling begins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Guppy, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) shoulders with becoming
modesty, <div class="bookquote">``that I can't make him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out. I appeal to our mutual friend
Smallweed whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) has or has not heard me remark that I can't make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed bears the concise testimony, <div class="bookquote">``A few!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen something of the profession and something of life,
Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``and it's seldom I can't make a man out, more
or less. But such an old card as this, so deep, so sly, and secret
-LRB-though I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ever sober-RRB-, I never came across. Now,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be precious old, you know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not a soul about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is reported to be immensely rich; and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a
smuggler, or a receiver, or an unlicensed pawnbroker, or a
money-lender--all of which I have thought likely at different
times--it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I
don't see why you shouldn't go in for it, when everything else
suits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jobling, Mr. Guppy, and Mr. Smallweed all lean their elbows on
the table and their chins upon their hands, and look at the ceiling.
After a time, they all drink, slowly lean back, put their hands in
their pockets, and look at one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had the energy I once possessed, Tony!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy with a
sigh. <div class="bookquote">``But there are chords in the human mind--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Expressing the remainder of the desolate sentiment in rum-and-water,
Mr. Guppy concludes by resigning the adventure to Tony Jobling and
informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) that during the vacation and while things are slack,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) purse, <div class="bookquote">``as far as three or four or even five pound goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>will be
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) disposal. <div class="bookquote">``For never shall it be said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy adds with
emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``that William Guppy turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that
Mr. Jobling says with emotion, <div class="bookquote">``Guppy, my trump, your fist!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Guppy presents it, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Jobling, my boy, there it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Jobling returns, <div class="bookquote">``Guppy, we have been pals now for some years!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Guppy replies, <div class="bookquote">``Jobling, we have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>They then shake hands, and Mr. Jobling adds in a feeling manner,
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take another glass
for old acquaintance sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Krook's last lodger died there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>observes Mr. Guppy in an incidental
way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) though!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a verdict. Accidental death. You don't mind that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jobling, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) might as well have
died somewhere else. It's devilish odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) need go and die at MY
place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jobling quite resents this liberty, several times
returning to it with such remarks as, <div class="bookquote">``There are places enough to die
in, I should think!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>or, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) wouldn't have liked my dying at HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
place, I dare say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>However, the compact being virtually made, Mr. Guppy proposes to
dispatch the trusty Smallweed to ascertain if Mr. Krook is at home,
as in that case they may complete the negotiation without delay. Mr.
Jobling approving, Smallweed puts himself under the tall hat and
conveys it out of the dining-rooms in the Guppy manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) soon
returns with the intelligence that Mr. Krook is at home and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) through the shop-door, sitting in the back premises,
sleeping <div class="bookquote">``like one o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll pay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``and we'll go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>). Small,
what will it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed, compelling the attendance of the waitress with one
hitch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) eyelash, instantly replies as follows: <div class="bookquote">``Four veals and
hams is three, and four potatoes is three and four, and one summer
cabbage is three and six, and three marrows is four and six, and six
breads is five, and three Cheshires is five and three, and four
half-pints of half-and-half is six and three, and four small rums is
eight and three, and three Pollys is eight and six. Eight and six in
half a sovereign, Polly, and eighteenpence out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waitress</b></font>)</div><p/>Not at all excited by these stupendous calculations, Smallweed
dismisses his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a
little admiring notice of Polly, as opportunity may serve, and to
read the daily papers, which are so very large in proportion to
himself, shorn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) hat, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) holds up the Times to run his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
eye over the columns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) seems to have retired for the night and to
have disappeared under the bedclothes.

<p/>Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop, where
they find Krook still sleeping like one o'clock, that is to say,
breathing stertorously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) chin upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) breast and quite
insensible to any external sounds or even to gentle shaking. On the
table beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>), among the usual lumber, stand an empty gin-bottle
and a glass. The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that
even the green eyes of the cat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) shelf, as they open and shut
and glimmer on the visitors, look drunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold up here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, giving the relaxed figure of the old
man another shake. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Krook! Halloa, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes with a
spirituous heat smouldering in it. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see such a stupor as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) falls into, between drink and sleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If this is his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) regular sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>returns Jobling, rather alarmed,
<div class="bookquote">``it'll last a long time one of these days, I am thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always more like a fit than a nap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
again. <div class="bookquote">``Halloa, your lordship! Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) might be robbed fifty times
over! Open your eyes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After much ado, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) opens them, but without appearing to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
visitors or any other objects. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) crosses one leg on another,
and folds his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hands, and several times closes and opens his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) parched
lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) seems to all intents and purposes as insensible as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) is alive, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``How are you, my Lord
Chancellor. I have brought a friend of mine, sir, on a little matter
of business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man still sits, often smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) dry lips without the least
consciousness. After some minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) makes an attempt to rise. They
help him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) staggers against the wall and stares at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Krook?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy in some discomfiture. <div class="bookquote">``How
do you do, sir? You are looking charming, Mr. Krook. I hope you are
pretty well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man, in aiming a purposeless blow at Mr. Guppy, or at
nothing, feebly swings himself round and comes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) face against
the wall. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) remains for a minute or two, heaped up against it,
and then staggers down the shop to the front door. The air, the
movement in the court, the lapse of time, or the combination of these
things recovers him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) comes back pretty steadily, adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) fur
cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head and looking keenly at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant, gentlemen; I've been dozing. Hi! I am hard to wake,
odd times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather so, indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>responds Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? You've been a-trying to do it, have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>says the suspicious
Krook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy explains.

<p/>The old man's eye resting on the empty bottle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) takes it up,
examines it, and slowly tilts it upside down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) cries like the hobgoblin in the story. <div class="bookquote">``Somebody's been
making free here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you we found it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Would you allow me to
get it filled for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, certainly I would!''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>cries Krook in high glee. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly I
would! Don't mention it! Get it filled next door--Sol's Arms--the
Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. Bless you, they know ME!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) so presses the empty bottle upon Mr. Guppy that that gentleman,
with a nod to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend, accepts the trust and hurries out and
hurries in again with the bottle filled. The old man receives it in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms like a beloved grandchild and pats it tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispers, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes screwed up, after tasting
it, <div class="bookquote">``this ain't the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. This is
eighteenpenny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you might like that better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a nobleman, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>returns Krook with another taste, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
hot breath seems to come towards them like a flame. <div class="bookquote">``You're a baron
of the land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Taking advantage of this auspicious moment, Mr. Guppy presents his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
friend under the impromptu name of Mr. Weevle and states the object
of their visit. Krook, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) bottle under his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) arm -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) never gets
beyond a certain point of either drunkenness or sobriety-RRB-, takes time
to survey his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) proposed lodger and seems to approve of him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You'd
like to see the room, young man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! It's a good room!
Been whitewashed. Been cleaned down with soft soap and soda. Hi! It's
worth twice the rent, letting alone my company when you want it and
such a cat to keep the mice away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Commending the room after this manner, the old man takes them
upstairs, where indeed they do find it cleaner than it used to be and
also containing some old articles of furniture which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has dug up
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inexhaustible stores. The terms are easily concluded--for
the Lord Chancellor cannot be hard on Mr. Guppy, associated as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is
with Kenge and Carboy, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, and other famous claims
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) professional consideration--and it is agreed that Mr. Weevle
shall take possession on the morrow. Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy then
repair to Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, where the personal
introduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is effected and -LRB-more
important-RRB- the vote and interest of Mrs. Snagsby are secured. They
then report progress to the eminent Smallweed, waiting at the office
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) tall hat for that purpose, and separate, Mr. Guppy explaining
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) would terminate his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) little entertainment by standing treat at
the play but that there are chords in the human mind which would
render it a hollow mockery.

<p/>On the morrow, in the dusk of evening, Mr. Weevle modestly appears at
Krook's, by no means incommoded with luggage, and establishes himself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) new lodging, where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) sleep, as if they were full of wonder. On the following day
Mr. Weevle, who is a handy good-for-nothing kind of young fellow,
borrows a needle and thread of Miss Flite and a hammer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>)
landlord and goes to work devising apologies for window-curtains, and
knocking up apologies for shelves, and hanging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) two teacups,
milkpot, and crockery sundries on a pennyworth of little hooks, like
a shipwrecked sailor making the best of it.

<p/>But what Mr. Weevle prizes most of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) few possessions -LRB-next
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) light whiskers, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) has an attachment that only
whiskers can awaken in the breast of man-RRB- is a choice collection of
copper-plate impressions from that truly national work The Divinities
of Albion, or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, representing ladies
of title and fashion in every variety of smirk that art, combined
with capital, is capable of producing. With these magnificent
portraits, unworthily confined in a band-box during his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seclusion
among the market-gardens, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) decorates his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apartment; and as the
Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy dress,
plays every variety of musical instrument, fondles every variety of
dog, ogles every variety of prospect, and is backed up by every
variety of flower-pot and balustrade, the result is very imposing.

<p/>But fashion is Mr. Weevle's, as it was Tony Jobling's, weakness. To
borrow yesterday's paper from the Sol's Arms of an evening and read
about the brilliant and distinguished meteors that are shooting
across the fashionable sky in every direction is unspeakable
consolation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>). To know what member of what brilliant and
distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished
feat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant
and distinguished feat of leaving it to-morrow gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) a thrill of
joy. To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty is
about, and means to be about, and what Galaxy marriages are on the
tapis, and what Galaxy rumours are in circulation, is to become
acquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind. Mr. Weevle
reverts from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits implicated,
and seems to know the originals, and to be known of them.

<p/>For the rest he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) is a quiet lodger, full of handy shifts and devices
as before mentioned, able to cook and clean for himself as well as to
carpenter, and developing social inclinations after the shades of
evening have fallen on the court. At those times, when he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) is not
visited by Mr. Guppy or by a small light in his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) likeness quenched in
a dark hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) comes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) dull room--where he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) has inherited the
deal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink--and talks to
Krook or is <div class="bookquote">``very free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>as they call it in the court, commendingly,
with any one disposed for conversation. Wherefore, Mrs. Piper, who
leads the court, is impelled to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins:
firstly, that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) Johnny was to have whiskers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) could wish 'em
to be identically like that young man's; and secondly, <div class="bookquote">``Mark my
words, Mrs. Perkins, ma'am, and don't you be surprised, Lord bless
you, if that young man comes in at last for old Krook's money!''




 (<font color='red'><b>that man</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXI

<p/>The Smallweed Family


<p/>In a rather ill-favoured and ill-savoured neighbourhood, though one
of its rising grounds bears the name of Mount Pleasant, the Elfin
Smallweed, christened Bartholomew and known on the domestic hearth as
Bart, passes that limited portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) time on which the office and
its contingencies have no claim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) dwells in a little narrow street,
always solitary, shady, and sad, closely bricked in on all sides like
a tomb, but where there yet lingers the stump of an old forest tree
whose flavour is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed smack of
youth.

<p/>There has been only one child in the Smallweed family for several
generations. Little old men and women there have been, but no child,
until Mr. Smallweed's grandmother, now living, became weak in her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)
intellect and fell -LRB-for the first time-RRB- into a childish state. With
such infantine graces as a total want of observation, memory,
understanding, and interest, and an eternal disposition to fall
asleep over the fire and into it, Mr. Smallweed's grandmother has
undoubtedly brightened the family.

<p/>Mr. Smallweed's grandfather is likewise of the party. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is in a
helpless condition as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) lower, and nearly so as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) upper,
limbs, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) mind is unimpaired. It holds, as well as it ever held,
the first four rules of arithmetic and a certain small collection of
the hardest facts. In respect of ideality, reverence, wonder, and
other such phrenological attributes, it is no worse off than it used
to be. Everything that Mr. Smallweed's grandfather ever put away in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) mind was a grub at first, and is a grub at last. In all his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) life
he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) has never bred a single butterfly.

<p/>The father of this pleasant grandfather, of the neighbourhood of
Mount Pleasant, was a horny-skinned, two-legged, money-getting
species of spider who spun webs to catch unwary flies and retired
into holes until they were entrapped. The name of this old pagan's
god was Compound Interest. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) lived for it, married it, died of it.
Meeting with a heavy loss in an honest little enterprise in which all
the loss was intended to have been on the other side, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) broke
something--something necessary to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) existence, therefore it
couldn't have been his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) heart--and made an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) career. As his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)
character was not good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had been bred at a charity school in a
complete course, according to question and answer, of those ancient
people the Amorites and Hittites, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was frequently quoted as an
example of the failure of education.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) spirit shone through his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) son, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had always preached of
<div class="bookquote">``going out''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>early in life and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) made a clerk in a sharp
scrivener's office at twelve years old. There the young gentleman
improved his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind, which was of a lean and anxious character, and
developing the family gifts, gradually elevated himself into the
discounting profession. Going out early in life and marrying late, as
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father had done before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) too begat a lean and
anxious-minded son, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turn, going out early in life and
marrying late, became the father of Bartholomew and Judith Smallweed,
twins. During the whole time consumed in the slow growth of this
family tree, the house of Smallweed, always early to go out and late
to marry, has strengthened itself in its practical character, has
discarded all amusements, discountenanced all story-books,
fairy-tales, fictions, and fables, and banished all levities
whatsoever. Hence the gratifying fact that it has had no child born
to it and that the complete little men and women whom it has produced
have been observed to bear a likeness to old monkeys with something
depressing on their minds.

<p/>At the present time, in the dark little parlour certain feet below
the level of the street--a grim, hard, uncouth parlour, only
ornamented with the coarsest of baize table-covers, and the hardest
of sheet-iron tea-trays, and offering in its decorative character no
bad allegorical representation of Grandfather Smallweed's
mind--seated in two black horsehair porter's chairs, one on each side
of the fire-place, the superannuated Mr. and Mrs. Smallweed while
away the rosy hours. On the stove are a couple of trivets for the
pots and kettles which it is Grandfather Smallweed's usual occupation
to watch, and projecting from the chimney-piece between them is a
sort of brass gallows for roasting, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) also superintends when
it is in action. Under the venerable Mr. Smallweed's seat and guarded
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) spindle legs is a drawer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) chair, reported to contain
property to a fabulous amount. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is a spare cushion with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is always provided in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) may have something to
throw at the venerable partner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) respected age whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
makes an allusion to money--a subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is particularly
sensitive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where's Bart?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>Grandfather Smallweed inquires of Judy, Bart's
twin sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) an't come in yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says Judy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) tea-time, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do you mean to say it wants then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Loud on the part of Judy.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandmother Smallweed, who has been mumbling and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) head at
the trivets, hearing figures mentioned, connects them with money and
screeches like a horrible old parrot without any plumage, <div class="bookquote">``Ten
ten-pound notes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a parrot</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drat you, be quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the good old man.

<p/>The effect of this act of jaculation is twofold. It not only doubles
up Mrs. Smallweed's head against the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) porter's chair and
causes her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) to present, when extricated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) granddaughter, a highly
unbecoming state of cap, but the necessary exertion recoils on Mr.
Smallweed himself, whom it throws back into HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) porter's chair like a
broken puppet. The excellent old gentleman being at these times a
mere clothes-bag with a black skull-cap on the top of it, does not
present a very animated appearance until he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has undergone the two
operations at the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) granddaughter of being shaken up like
a great bottle and poked and punched like a great bolster. Some
indication of a neck being developed in him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by these means, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and
the sharer of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life's evening again fronting one another in their
two porter's chairs, like a couple of sentinels long forgotten on
their post by the Black Serjeant, Death.

<p/>Judy the twin is worthy company for these associates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) is so
indubitably sister to Mr. Smallweed the younger that the two kneaded
into one would hardly make a young person of average proportions,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) so happily exemplifies the before-mentioned family likeness
to the monkey tribe that attired in a spangled robe and cap she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) might
walk about the table-land on the top of a barrel-organ without
exciting much remark as an unusual specimen. Under existing
circumstances, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) is dressed in a plain, spare gown of
brown stuff.

<p/>Judy never owned a doll, never heard of Cinderella, never played at
any game. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) once or twice fell into children's company when she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) was
about ten years old, but the children couldn't get on with Judy, and
Judy couldn't get on with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) seemed like an animal of another
species, and there was instinctive repugnance on both sides. It is
very doubtful whether Judy knows how to laugh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) has so rarely seen
the thing done that the probabilities are strong the other way. Of
anything like a youthful laugh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) certainly can have no conception.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) were to try one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) teeth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) way,
modelling that action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) has unconsciously modelled
all its other expressions, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) pattern of sordid age. Such is
Judy.

<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) twin brother couldn't wind up a top for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows no
more of Jack the Giant Killer or of Sinbad the Sailor than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>) knows
of the people in the stars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>) could as soon play at leap-frog or at
cricket as change into a cricket or a frog himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>) is so much
the better off than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>) sister that on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>) narrow world of fact an
opening has dawned into such broader regions as lie within the ken of
Mr. Guppy. Hence his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) admiration and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) emulation of that shining
enchanter.

<p/>Judy, with a gong-like clash and clatter, sets one of the sheet-iron
tea-trays on the table and arranges cups and saucers. The bread she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
puts on in an iron basket, and the butter -LRB-and not much of it-RRB- in a
small pewter plate. Grandfather Smallweed looks hard after the tea as
it is served out and asks Judy where the girl is.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley, do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says Judy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>from Grandfather Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley, do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/>This touches a spring in Grandmother Smallweed, who, chuckling as
usual at the trivets, cries, <div class="bookquote">``Over the water! Charley over the water,
Charley over the water, over the water to Charley, Charley over the
water, over the water to Charley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandmother</b></font>)</div>and becomes quite energetic about
it. Grandfather looks at the cushion but has not sufficiently
recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) late exertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) says when there is silence. <div class="bookquote">``If that's her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) eats a
deal. It would be better to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) keep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div><p/>Judy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) brother's wink, shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) head and purses up her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
mouth into no without saying it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the man</b></font>)</div>returns the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'d want sixpence a day, and we can do it for less,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says Judy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div><p/>Judy answers with a nod of deepest meaning and calls, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) scrapes
the butter on the loaf with every precaution against waste and cuts
it into slices, <div class="bookquote">``You, Charley, where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Timidly obedient to
the summons, a little girl in a rough apron and a large bonnet, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands covered with soap and water and a scrubbing brush in one of
them, appears, and curtsys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What work are you about now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says Judy, making an ancient snap at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) like a very sharp old beldame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a-cleaning the upstairs back room, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>replies Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind you do it thoroughly, and don't loiter. Shirking won't do for
me. Make haste! Go along!''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground.
<div class="bookquote">``You girls are more trouble than you're worth, by half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this matron</b></font>)</div><p/>On this severe matron, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) task of scraping the
butter and cutting the bread, falls the shadow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) brother,
looking in at the window. For whom, knife and loaf in hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) opens
the street-door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, Bart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``Here you are, hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bart</b></font>)</div>says Bart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Been along with your friend again, Bart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Small nods.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dining at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) expense, Bart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Small nods again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right. Live at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) expense as much as you can, and take
warning by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) foolish example. That's the use of such a friend. The
only use you can put him (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) to,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sage</b></font>)</div>says the venerable sage.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) grandson, without receiving this good counsel as dutifully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>)
might, honours it with all such acceptance as may lie in a slight
wink and a nod and takes a chair at the tea-table. The four old faces
then hover over teacups like a company of ghastly cherubim, Mrs.
Smallweed perpetually twitching her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) head and chattering at the
trivets and Mr. Smallweed requiring to be repeatedly shaken up like a
large black draught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the good old gentleman, reverting to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lesson of
wisdom. <div class="bookquote">``That's such advice as your father would have given you,
Bart. You never saw your father. More's the pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) was my true
son.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Whether it is intended to be conveyed that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was particularly
pleasant to look at, on that account, does not appear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) was my true son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>repeats the old gentleman, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bread
and butter on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knee, <div class="bookquote">``a good accountant, and died fifteen years
ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Smallweed, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) usual instinct, breaks out with
<div class="bookquote">``Fifteen hundred pound. Fifteen hundred pound in a black box, fifteen
hundred pound locked up, fifteen hundred pound put away and hid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
worthy husband, setting aside his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bread and butter, immediately
discharges the cushion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>), crushes her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) against the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
chair, and falls back in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own, overpowered. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appearance, after
visiting Mrs. Smallweed with one of these admonitions, is
particularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing, firstly because
the exertion generally twists his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) black skull-cap over one eye and
gives him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) an air of goblin rakishness, secondly because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mutters
violent imprecations against Mrs. Smallweed, and thirdly because the
contrast between those powerful expressions and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) powerless figure
is suggestive of a baleful old malignant who would be very wicked if
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could. All this, however, is so common in the Smallweed family
circle that it produces no impression. The old gentleman is merely
shaken and has his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) internal feathers beaten up, the cushion is
restored to its usual place beside him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and the old lady, perhaps
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cap adjusted and perhaps not, is planted in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair again,
ready to be bowled down like a ninepin.

<p/>Some time elapses in the present instance before the old gentleman is
sufficiently cool to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) discourse, and even then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mixes it
up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious
partner of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bosom, who holds communication with nothing on earth
but the trivets. As thus: <div class="bookquote">``If your father, Bart, had lived longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>)
might have been worth a deal of money--you brimstone chatterer!--but
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) was beginning to build up the house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) had been
making the foundations for, through many a year--you jade of a
magpie, jackdaw, and poll-parrot, what do you mean!--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) took ill and
died of a low fever, always being a sparing and a spare man, full of
business care--I should like to throw a cat at you instead of a
cushion, and I will too if you make such a confounded fool of
yourself!--and your mother, who was a prudent woman as dry as a chip,
just dwindled away like touchwood after you and Judy were born--you
are an old pig. You are a brimstone pig. You're a head of swine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div><p/>Judy, not interested in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) has often heard, begins to collect
in a basin various tributary streams of tea, from the bottoms of cups
and saucers and from the bottom of the tea-pot for the little
charwoman's evening meal. In like manner she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) gets together, in the
iron bread-basket, as many outside fragments and worn-down heels of
loaves as the rigid economy of the house has left in existence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But your father and me were partners, Bart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the old gentleman,
<div class="bookquote">``and when I am gone, you and Judy will have all there is. It's rare
for you both that you went out early in life--Judy to the flower
business, and you to the law. You won't want to spend it. You'll get
your living without it, and put more to it. When I am gone, Judy will
go back to the flower business and you'll still stick to the law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>One might infer from Judy's appearance that her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) business rather lay
with the thorns than the flowers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) has in her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) time been
apprenticed to the art and mystery of artificial flower-making. A
close observer might perhaps detect both in her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) eye and her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
brother's, when their venerable grandsire anticipates his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being gone,
some little impatience to know when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may be going, and some
resentful opinion that it is time he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, if everybody has done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says Judy, completing her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) preparations,
<div class="bookquote">``I'll have that girl in to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would never leave off if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
took it by herself in the kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley is accordingly introduced, and under a heavy fire of eyes,
sits down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) basin and a Druidical ruin of bread and butter. In
the active superintendence of this young person, Judy Smallweed
appears to attain a perfectly geological age and to date from the
remotest periods. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) systematic manner of flying at her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) and pouncing
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>), with or without pretence, whether or no, is wonderful,
evincing an accomplishment in the art of girl-driving seldom reached
by the oldest practitioners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't stare about you all the afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>cries Judy, shaking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) head and stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) foot as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) happens to catch the glance
which has been previously sounding the basin of tea, <div class="bookquote">``but take your
victuals and get back to your work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>says Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Miss Smallweed, <div class="bookquote">``for I know what you girls
are. Do it without saying it, and then I may begin to believe you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley swallows a great gulp of tea in token of submission and so
disperses the Druidical ruins that Miss Smallweed charges her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) not to
gormandize, which <div class="bookquote">``in you girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) observes, is disgusting.
Charley might find some more difficulty in meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) views on the
general subject of girls but for a knock at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See who it is, and don't chew when you open it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>cries Judy.

<p/>The object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) attentions withdrawing for the purpose, Miss
Smallweed takes that opportunity of jumbling the remainder of the
bread and butter together and launching two or three dirty tea-cups
into the ebb-tide of the basin of tea as a hint that she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) considers
the eating and drinking terminated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now! Who is it, and what's wanted?''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says the snappish Judy.

<p/>It is one Mr. George, it appears. Without other announcement or
ceremony, Mr. George walks in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``You are hot here. Always a fire, eh? Well!
Perhaps you do right to get used to one.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George makes the latter
remark to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nods to Grandfather Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! It's you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cries the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``How de do? How de do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Middling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>replies Mr. George, taking a chair. <div class="bookquote">``Your granddaughter I
have had the honour of seeing before; my service to you, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my grandson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``You ha'n't seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) before. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) is in the law and not much at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My service to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>), too! He (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) is like his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) is very like his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>)
sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) is devilish like his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, laying a
great and not altogether complimentary stress on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) last adjective.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how does the world use you, Mr. George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>Grandfather Smallweed
inquires, slowly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty much as usual. Like a football.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is a swarthy brown man of fifty, well made, and good looking, with
crisp dark hair, bright eyes, and a broad chest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) sinewy and
powerful hands, as sunburnt as his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) face, have evidently been used to
a pretty rough life. What is curious about him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) sits
forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) chair as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) were, from long habit, allowing space
for some dress or accoutrements that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) has altogether laid aside.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) step too is measured and heavy and would go well with a weighty
clash and jingle of spurs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is close-shaved now, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) mouth is
set as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) upper lip had been for years familiar with a great
moustache; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) manner of occasionally laying the open palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
broad brown hand upon it is to the same effect. Altogether one might
guess Mr. George to have been a trooper once upon a time.

<p/>A special contrast Mr. George makes to the Smallweed family. Trooper
was never yet billeted upon a household more unlike him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). It is a
broadsword to an oyster-knife. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) developed figure and their stunted
forms, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) large manner filling any amount of room and their little
narrow pinched ways, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sounding voice and their sharp spare tones,
are in the strongest and the strangest opposition. As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sits in the
middle of the grim parlour, leaning a little forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thighs and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) elbows squared, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looks as though, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
remained there long, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would absorb into himself the whole family
and the whole four-roomed house, extra little back-kitchen and all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you rub your legs to rub life into 'em?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asks of Grandfather
Smallweed after looking round the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's partly a habit, Mr. George, and--yes--it partly helps the
circulation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) replies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cir-cu-la-tion!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. George, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
chest and seeming to become two sizes larger. <div class="bookquote">``Not much of that, I
should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly I'm old, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``But I can
carry my years. I'm older than HER,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>nodding at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``and see
what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is? You're a brimstone chatterer!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>with a sudden revival of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) late hostility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unlucky old soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head in that
direction. <div class="bookquote">``Don't scold the old lady. Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) here, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poor
cap half off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poor hair all in a muddle. Hold up,
ma'am. That's better. There we are! Think of your mother, Mr.
Smallweed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, coming back to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) seat from assisting
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if your wife an't enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you were an excellent son, Mr. George?''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>the old man hints
with a leer.

<p/>The colour of Mr. George's face rather deepens as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) replies, <div class="bookquote">``Why
no. I wasn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am astonished at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I. I ought to have been a good son, and I think I meant to
have been one. But I wasn't. I was a thundering bad son, that's the
long and the short of it, and never was a credit to anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surprising!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cries the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George resumes, <div class="bookquote">``the less said about it, the better
now. Come! You know the agreement. Always a pipe out of the two
months' interest! -LRB-Bosh! It's all correct. You needn't be afraid to
order the pipe. Here's the new bill, and here's the two months'
interest-money, and a devil-and-all of a scrape it is to get it
together in my business.-RRB-''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George sits, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms folded, consuming the family and the
parlour while Grandfather Smallweed is assisted by Judy to two black
leathern cases out of a locked bureau, in one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) secures the
document he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has just received, and from the other takes another
similar document which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands to Mr. George, who twists it up for a
pipelight. As the old man inspects, through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glasses, every
up-stroke and down-stroke of both documents before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) releases them
from their leathern prison, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) counts the money three times
over and requires Judy to say every word she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) utters at least twice,
and is as tremulously slow of speech and action as it is possible to
be, this business is a long time in progress. When it is quite
concluded, and not before, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disengages his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ravenous eyes and
fingers from it and answers Mr. George's last remark by saying,
<div class="bookquote">``Afraid to order the pipe? We are not so mercenary as that, sir.
Judy, see directly to the pipe and the glass of cold brandy-and-water
for Mr. George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>The sportive twins, who have been looking straight before them all
this time except when they have been engrossed by the black leathern
cases, retire together, generally disdainful of the visitor, but
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to the old man as two young cubs might leave a traveller
to the parental bear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George
with folded arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man nods.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Devil doubt him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. Charley appearing with a

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I goes out to work, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>returns Charley.

<p/>The trooper -LRB-if trooper he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) be or have been-RRB- takes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet off,
with a light touch for so strong a hand, and pats her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the head.
<div class="bookquote">``You give the house almost a wholesome look. It wants a bit of youth

pipe, and drinks to Mr. Smallweed's friend in the city--the one
solitary flight of that esteemed old gentleman's imagination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) might be hard upon me, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Incautiously, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) stricken better-half, who has been dozing
over the fire for some time, is instantly aroused and jabbers <div class="bookquote">``Twenty
thousand pounds, twenty twenty-pound notes in a money-box, twenty
guineas, twenty million twenty per cent, twenty--''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>and is then cut
short by the flying cushion, which the visitor, to whom this singular
experiment appears to be a novelty, snatches from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face as it
crushes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the usual manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a brimstone idiot. You're a scorpion--a brimstone scorpion!

chair. <div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, will you shake me up a little?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George, who has been looking first at one of them and then at the
other, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were demented, takes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) venerable acquaintance by
the throat on receiving this request, and dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) upright in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
chair as easily as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were a doll, appears in two minds whether or
no to shake all future power of cushioning out of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and shake him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grave. Resisting the temptation, but agitating him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) violently
enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head roll like a harlequin's, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) puts him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) smartly
down in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair again and adjusts his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) skull-cap with such a rub
that the old man winks with both eyes for a minute afterwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>gasps Mr. Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``That'll do. Thank you, my dear
friend, that'll do. Oh, dear me, I'm out of breath. O Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>And Mr.
Smallweed says it not without evident apprehensions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) dear
friend, who still stands over him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) looming larger than ever.

<p/>The alarming presence, however, gradually subsides into its chair and
falls to smoking in long puffs, consoling itself with the
philosophical reflection, <div class="bookquote">``The name of your friend in the city begins
with a D, comrade, and you're about right respecting the bond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you speak, Mr. George?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquires the old man.

<p/>The trooper shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head, and leaning forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) right elbow
on his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) right knee and his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) pipe supported in that hand, while his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
other hand, resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) left leg, squares his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) left elbow in a
martial manner, continues to smoke. Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) looks at Mr.
Smallweed with grave attention and now and then fans the cloud of
smoke away in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) may see him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) the more clearly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) says, making just as much and as little change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's not for the value of it; that's no great thing. It was a

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George laughs and drinks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha'n't you no relations, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>asks Grandfather Smallweed with a
twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``who would pay off this little principal or who

Mr. George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George, still composedly smoking, replies, <div class="bookquote">``If I had, I shouldn't
trouble them. I have been trouble enough to my belongings in my day.
It MAY be a very good sort of penitence in a vagabond, who has wasted
the best time of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life, to go back then to decent people that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
never was a credit to and live upon them, but it's not my sort. The

opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But natural affection, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>hints Grandfather Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For two good names, hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head and
still composedly smoking. <div class="bookquote">``No. That's not my sort either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandfather Smallweed has been gradually sliding down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) chair
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) last adjustment and is now a bundle of clothes with a voice
in it calling for Judy. That houri, appearing, shakes him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) up in the
usual manner and is charged by the old gentleman to remain near him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
For he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seems chary of putting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) visitor to the trouble of repeating
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) late attentions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) observes when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is in trim again. ``If you could have traced
out the captain, Mr. George, it would have been the making of you. If
when you first came here, in consequence of our advertisement in the
newspapers--when I say ``our,<div class="bookquote">'' I'm alluding to the advertisements of
my friend in the city, and one or two others who embark their capital
in the same way, and are so friendly towards me as sometimes to give
me a lift with my little pittance--if at that time you could have

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I was willing enough to be ``made,<div class="bookquote">'' as you call it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George,
smoking not quite so placidly as before, for since the entrance of
Judy he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has been in some measure disturbed by a fascination, not of
the admiring kind, which obliges him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) stands by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) grandfather's chair, <div class="bookquote">``but on the whole, I am glad I wasn't now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, if you like. What two reasons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. George, but still looking at Judy
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) being so old and so like her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) grandfather it is indifferent
which of the two he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) addresses, ``you gentlemen took me in. You
advertised that Mr. Hawdon -LRB-Captain Hawdon, if you hold to the saying
<div class="bookquote">``Once a captain, always a captain'-RRB- was to hear of something to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the man</b></font>)</div>returns the old man shrilly and sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, smoking on. <div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't have been much to
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) advantage to have been clapped into prison by the whole bill and
judgment trade of London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that? Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) rich relations might have paid his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
debts or compounded for 'em. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had taken US in. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) owed us
immense sums all round. I would sooner have strangled him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) than had no

up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) impotent ten fingers, <div class="bookquote">``I want to strangle him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) now.''  (<font color='red'><b>snarls the man</b></font>)</div>And in a
sudden access of fury, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) throws the cushion at the unoffending Mrs.
Smallweed, but it passes harmlessly on one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't need to be told,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) pipe from
his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) lips for a moment and carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) eyes back from following the
progress of the cushion to the pipe-bowl which is burning low, <div class="bookquote">``that
he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) carried on heavily and went to ruin. I have been at his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) right hand

when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was sick and well, rich and poor. I laid this hand upon him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
after he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had run through everything and broken down everything
beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)--when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) held a pistol to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had let it off,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the benevolent old man, <div class="bookquote">``and blown

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would have been a smash indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper coolly;

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope number two's as good?''  (<font color='red'><b>snarls the man</b></font>)</div>snarls the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no. It's more of a selfish reason. If I had found him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), I must

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't lose your temper as well as your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George,
calmly knocking the ashes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was drowned long
before. I am convinced of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) went over a ship's side. Whether

the city does. Do you know what that tune is, Mr. Smallweed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) adds
after breaking off to whistle one, accompanied on the table with the
empty pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tune!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the old man. <div class="bookquote">``No. We never have tunes here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the Dead March in Saul. They bury soldiers to it,

evening, Mr. Smallweed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man gives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you think your friend in the city will be hard upon me if I fall
in a payment?''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, looking down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like a giant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returns the old man, looking
up at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like a pygmy.

<p/>Mr. George laughs, and with a glance at Mr. Smallweed and a parting
salutation to the scornful Judy, strides out of the parlour, clashing
imaginary sabres and other metallic appurtenances as he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) goes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a damned rogue,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the old gentleman, making a hideous
grimace at the door as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shuts it. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll lime you, you dog, I'll
lime you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After this amiable remark, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spirit soars into those enchanting
regions of reflection which its education and pursuits have opened to
it, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours, two
unrelieved sentinels forgotten as aforesaid by the Black Serjeant.

<p/>While the twain are faithful to their post, Mr. George strides
through the streets with a massive kind of swagger and a grave-enough
face. It is eight o'clock now, and the day is fast drawing in. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
stops hard by Waterloo Bridge and reads a playbill, decides to go to
Astley's Theatre. Being there, is much delighted with the horses and
the feats of strength; looks at the weapons with a critical eye;
disapproves of the combats as giving evidences of unskilful
swordsmanship; but is touched home by the sentiments. In the last
scene, when the Emperor of Tartary gets up into a cart and
condescends to bless the united lovers by hovering over them with the
Union Jack, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyelashes are moistened with emotion.

<p/>The theatre over, Mr. George comes across the water again and makes
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way to that curious region lying about the Haymarket and
Leicester Square which is a centre of attraction to indifferent
foreign hotels and indifferent foreigners, racket-courts,
fighting-men, swordsmen, footguards, old china, gaming-houses,
exhibitions, and a large medley of shabbiness and shrinking out of
sight. Penetrating to the heart of this region, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arrives by a court
and a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of
bare walls, floors, roof-rafters, and skylights, on the front of
which, if it can be said to have any front, is painted GEORGE``S
SHOOTING GALLERY, &c.

<p/>Into George's Shooting Gallery, &c., he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) goes; and in it there are
gaslights -LRB-partly turned off now-RRB-, and two whitened targets for
rifle-shooting, and archery accommodation, and fencing appliances,
and all necessaries for the British art of boxing. None of these
sports or exercises being pursued in George's Shooting Gallery
to-night, which is so devoid of company that a little grotesque man
with a large head has it all to himself and lies asleep upon the
floor.

<p/>The little man is dressed something like a gunsmith, in a green-baize
apron and cap; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face and hands are dirty with gunpowder and
begrimed with the loading of guns. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lies in the light before a
glaring white target, the black upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shines again. Not far off is
the strong, rough, primitive table with a vice upon it at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has been working. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a little man with a face all crushed
together, who appears, from a certain blue and speckled appearance
that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks presents, to have been blown up, in the way of
business, at some odd time or times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phil!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper in a quiet voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>cries Phil, scrambling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything been doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Flat as ever so much swipes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil. <div class="bookquote">``Five dozen rifle and a
dozen pistol. As to aim!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>Phil gives a howl at the recollection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up shop, Phil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>As Phil moves about to execute this order, it appears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) is
lame, though able to move very quickly. On the speckled side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
face he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) has no eyebrow, and on the other side he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) has a bushy black
one, which want of uniformity gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) a very singular and rather
sinister appearance. Everything seems to have happened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) hands
that could possibly take place consistently with the retention of all
the fingers, for they are notched, and seamed, and crumpled all over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) appears to be very strong and lifts heavy benches about as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
had no idea what weight was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) has a curious way of limping round
the gallery with his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) shoulder against the wall and tacking off at
objects he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) wants to lay hold of instead of going straight to them,
which has left a smear all round the four walls, conventionally
called <div class="bookquote">``Phil's mark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This custodian of George's Gallery in George's absence concludes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
proceedings, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has locked the great doors and turned out all
the lights but one, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leaves to glimmer, by dragging out from
a wooden cabin in a corner two mattresses and bedding. These being
drawn to opposite ends of the gallery, the trooper makes his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) own bed
and Phil makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phil!''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>says the master, walking towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) without his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) coat and
waistcoat, and looking more soldierly than ever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) braces. <div class="bookquote">``You
were found in a doorway, weren't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gutter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil. <div class="bookquote">``Watchman tumbled over me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then vagabondizing came natural to YOU from the beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As nat`ral as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, guv`ner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil cannot even go straight to bed, but finds it necessary to
shoulder round two sides of the gallery and then tack off at his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
mattress. The trooper, after taking a turn or two in the
rifle-distance and looking up at the moon now shining through the
skylights, strides to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) own mattress by a shorter route and goes to
bed too.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII

<p/>Mr. Bucket


<p/>Allegory looks pretty cool in Lincoln's Inn Fields, though the
evening is hot, for both Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows are wide open, and
the room is lofty, gusty, and gloomy. These may not be desirable
characteristics when November comes with fog and sleet or January
with ice and snow, but they have their merits in the sultry long
vacation weather. They enable Allegory, though it has cheeks like
peaches, and knees like bunches of blossoms, and rosy swellings for
calves to its legs and muscles to its arms, to look tolerably cool
to-night.

<p/>Plenty of dust comes in at Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows, and plenty more
has generated among his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) furniture and papers. It lies thick
everywhere. When a breeze from the country that has lost its way
takes fright and makes a blind hurry to rush out again, it flings as
much dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law--or Mr. Tulkinghorn, one
of its trustiest representatives--may scatter, on occasion, in the
eyes of the laity.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) lowering magazine of dust, the universal article into which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) papers and himself, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) clients, and all things of earth,
animate and inanimate, are resolving, Mr. Tulkinghorn sits at one of
the open windows enjoying a bottle of old port. Though a hard-grained
man, close, dry, and silent, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can enjoy old wine with the best. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has a priceless bin of port in some artful cellar under the Fields,
which is one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) many secrets. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dines alone in chambers, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has dined to-day, and has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bit of fish and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steak or chicken
brought in from the coffee-house, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) descends with a candle to the
echoing regions below the deserted mansion, and heralded by a remote
reverberation of thundering doors, comes gravely back encircled by an
earthy atmosphere and carrying a bottle from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pours a radiant
nectar, two score and ten years old, that blushes in the glass to
find itself so famous and fills the whole room with the fragrance of
southern grapes.

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn, sitting in the twilight by the open window, enjoys
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) wine. As if it whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) of its fifty years of silence and
seclusion, it shuts him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) up the closer. More impenetrable than ever,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) sits, and drinks, and mellows as it were in secrecy, pondering at
that twilight hour on all the mysteries he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) knows, associated with
darkening woods in the country, and vast blank shut-up houses in
town, and perhaps sparing a thought or two for himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
family history, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) money, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) will--all a mystery to every
one--and that one bachelor friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), a man of the same mould and
a lawyer too, who lived the same kind of life until he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) was
seventy-five years old, and then suddenly conceiving -LRB-as it is
supposed-RRB- an impression that it was too monotonous, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) gold
watch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hair-dresser one summer evening and walked leisurely
home to the Temple and hanged himself.

<p/>But Mr. Tulkinghorn is not alone to-night to ponder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) usual
length. Seated at the same table, though with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chair modestly and
uncomfortably drawn a little way from it, sits a bald, mild, shining
man who coughs respectfully behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand when the lawyer bids him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fill his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, <div class="bookquote">``to go over this odd story
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me when you were so good as to step round here last
night--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For which I must ask you to excuse me if it was a liberty, sir; but
I remember that you had taken a sort of an interest in that person,
and I thought it possible that you might--just--wish--to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn is not the man to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) to any conclusion or to
admit anything as to any possibility concerning himself. So Mr.
Snagsby trails off into saying, with an awkward cough, <div class="bookquote">``I must ask
you to excuse the liberty, sir, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``You told me, Snagsby, that you
put on your hat and came round without mentioning your intention to
your wife. That was prudent I think, because it's not a matter of
such importance that it requires to be mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``you see, my little woman is--not
to put too fine a point upon it--inquisitive. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s inquisitive. Poor
little thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s liable to spasms, and it's good for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to have
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind employed. In consequence of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) employs it--I should
say upon every individual thing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can lay hold of, whether it
concerns her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) or not--especially not. My little woman has a very
active mind, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby drinks and murmurs with an admiring cough behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
hand, <div class="bookquote">``Dear me, very fine wine indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``And to-night too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, and to-night, too. My little woman is at present in--not
to put too fine a point on it--in a pious state, or in what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
considers such, and attends the Evening Exertions -LRB-which is the name
they go by-RRB- of a reverend party of the name of Chadband. He (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) has a
great deal of eloquence at his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) command, undoubtedly, but I am not
quite favourable to his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) style myself. That's neither here nor there.
My little woman being engaged in that way made it easier for me to
step round in a quiet manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn assents. <div class="bookquote">``Fill your glass, Snagsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>returns the stationer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) cough of
deference. <div class="bookquote">``This is wonderfully fine wine, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a rare wine now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``It is fifty years
old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it indeed, sir? But I am not surprised to hear it, I am sure. It
might be--any age almost.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>After rendering this general tribute to
the port, Mr. Snagsby in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) modesty coughs an apology behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
hand for drinking anything so precious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you run over, once again, what the boy said?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>asks Mr.
Tulkinghorn, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) rusty
smallclothes and leaning quietly back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, with fidelity, though with some prolixity, the law-stationer
repeats Jo's statement made to the assembled guests at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) house. On
coming to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) narrative, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) gives a great start and breaks
off with, <div class="bookquote">``Dear me, sir, I wasn't aware there was any other gentleman
present!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby is dismayed to see, standing with an attentive face
between himself and the lawyer at a little distance from the table, a
person with a hat and stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand who was not there when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
himself came in and has not since entered by the door or by either of
the windows. There is a press in the room, but its hinges have not
creaked, nor has a step been audible upon the floor. Yet this third
person stands there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) attentive face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hat and stick in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hands, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), a composed and quiet listener.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is a stoutly built, steady-looking, sharp-eyed man in black, of
about the middle-age. Except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) looks at Mr. Snagsby as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
were going to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) portrait, there is nothing remarkable about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) at first sight but his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) ghostly manner of appearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind this gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) quiet way.
<div class="bookquote">``This is only Mr. Bucket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the stationer</b></font>)</div>returns the stationer, expressing by a cough that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is quite in the dark as to who Mr. Bucket may be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to hear this story,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``because I have
half a mind -LRB-for a reason-RRB- to know more of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is very
intelligent in such things. What do you say to this, Bucket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very plain, sir. Since our people have moved this boy on, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s not to be found on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) old lay, if Mr. Snagsby don't object to
go down with me to Tom-all-Alone's and point him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) out, we can have him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
here in less than a couple of hours' time. I can do it without Mr.
Snagsby, of course, but this is the shortest way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bucket is a detective officer, Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer in
explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) indeed, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby with a strong tendency in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
clump of hair to stand on end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you have no real objection to accompany Mr. Bucket to the
place in question,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>pursues the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``I shall feel obliged to you
if you will do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>In a moment's hesitation on the part of Mr. Snagsby, Bucket dips down
to the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be afraid of hurting the boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``You won't do
that. It's all right as far as the boy's concerned. We shall only
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) here to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a question or so I want to put to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trouble and sent away again. It'll be a good
job for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). I promise you, as a man, that you shall see the boy sent
away all right. Don't you be afraid of hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); you an't going to
do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mr. Tulkinghorn!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Snagsby cheerfully. And
reassured, <div class="bookquote">``Since that's the case--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! And lookee here, Mr. Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>resumes Bucket, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) aside
by the arm, tapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) familiarly on the breast, and speaking in a
confidential tone. <div class="bookquote">``You're a man of the world, you know, and a man of
business, and a man of sense. That's what YOU are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>returns
the stationer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of modesty, <div class="bookquote">``but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what YOU are, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>says Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Now, it an't necessary
to say to a man like you, engaged in your business, which is a
business of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
senses about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head screwed on tight -LRB-I had an uncle in
your business once-RRB---it an't necessary to say to a man like you that
it's the best and wisest way to keep little matters like this quiet.
Don't you see? Quiet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind telling YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket with an engaging appearance
of frankness, <div class="bookquote">``that as far as I can understand it, there seems to be
a doubt whether this dead person wasn't entitled to a little
property, and whether this female hasn't been up to some games
respecting that property, don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, but not appearing to see quite distinctly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what YOU want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>pursues Bucket, again tapping Mr. Snagsby on
the breast in a comfortable and soothing manner, <div class="bookquote">``is that every
person should have their rights according to justice. That's what YOU
want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Snagsby with a nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On account of which, and at the same time to oblige a--do you call
it, in your business, customer or client? I forget how my uncle used
to call it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I generally say customer myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>replies Mr. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) quite
affectionately. <div class="bookquote">''--On account of which, and at the same time to
oblige a real good customer, you mean to go down with me, in
confidence, to Tom-all-Alone's and to keep the whole thing quiet ever
afterwards and never mention it to any one. That's about your
intentions, if I understand you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, sir. You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then here's your hat,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>returns his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) new friend, quite as intimate
with it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) had made it; <div class="bookquote">``and if you're ready, I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn, without a ruffle on the surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
unfathomable depths, drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) old wine, and go down into the
streets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't happen to know a very good sort of person of the name of
Gridley, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket in friendly converse as they descend
the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, considering, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know anybody of that
name. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket; <div class="bookquote">``only having allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) temper to
get a little the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) and having been threatening some
respectable people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) is keeping out of the way of a warrant I have
got against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>)--which it's a pity that a man of sense should do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>As they walk along, Mr. Snagsby observes, as a novelty, that however
quick their pace may be, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) companion still seems in some
undefinable manner to lurk and lounge; also, that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is
going to turn to the right or left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) pretends to have a fixed
purpose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mind of going straight ahead, and wheels off, sharply,
at the very last moment. Now and then, when they pass a
police-constable on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) beat, Mr. Snagsby notices that both the
constable and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come
towards each other, and appear entirely to overlook each other, and
to gaze into space. In a few instances, Mr. Bucket, coming behind
some under-sized young man with a shining hat on, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sleek hair
twisted into one flat curl on each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head, almost without
glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) touches him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stick, upon which the young man,
looking round, instantly evaporates. For the most part Mr. Bucket
notices things in general, with a face as unchanging as the great
mourning ring on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) little finger or the brooch, composed of not
much diamond and a good deal of setting, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shirt.

<p/>When they come at last to Tom-all-Alone's, Mr. Bucket stops for a
moment at the corner and takes a lighted bull's-eye from the
constable on duty there, who then accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) own
particular bull's-eye at his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) waist. Between his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) two conductors, Mr.
Snagsby passes along the middle of a villainous street, undrained,
unventilated, deep in black mud and corrupt water--though the roads
are dry elsewhere--and reeking with such smells and sights that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>),
who has lived in London all his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) life, can scarce believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) senses.
Branching from this street and its heaps of ruins are other streets
and courts so infamous that Mr. Snagsby sickens in body and mind and
feels as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) were going every moment deeper down into the infernal
gulf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Draw off a bit here, Mr. Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket as a kind of shabby
palanquin is borne towards them, surrounded by a noisy crowd. <div class="bookquote">``Here's
the fever coming up the street!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div><p/>As the unseen wretch goes by, the crowd, leaving that object of
attraction, hovers round the three visitors like a dream of horrible
faces and fades away up alleys and into ruins and behind walls, and
with occasional cries and shrill whistles of warning, thenceforth
flits about them until they leave the place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are those the fever-houses, Darby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket coolly asks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bull's-eye on a line of stinking ruins.

<p/>Darby replies that <div class="bookquote">``all them are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darby</b></font>)</div>and further that in all, for
months and months, the people <div class="bookquote">``have been down by dozens''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>and have
been carried out dead and dying <div class="bookquote">``like sheep with the rot.''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>Bucket
observing to Mr. Snagsby as they go on again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) looks a little
poorly, Mr. Snagsby answers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) feels as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) couldn't breathe
the dreadful air.

<p/>There is inquiry made at various houses for a boy named Jo. As few
people are known in Tom-all-Alone's by any Christian sign, there is
much reference to Mr. Snagsby whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) means Carrots, or the
Colonel, or Gallows, or Young Chisel, or Terrier Tip, or Lanky, or
the Brick. Mr. Snagsby describes over and over again. There are
conflicting opinions respecting the original of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) picture. Some
think it must be Carrots, some say the Brick. The Colonel is
produced, but is not at all near the thing. Whenever Mr. Snagsby and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) conductors are stationary, the crowd flows round, and from its
squalid depths obsequious advice heaves up to Mr. Bucket. Whenever
they move, and the angry bull's-eyes glare, it fades away and flits
about them up the alleys, and in the ruins, and behind the walls, as
before.

<p/>At last there is a lair found out where Toughy, or the Tough Subject,
lays him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) down at night; and it is thought that the Tough Subject may
be Jo. Comparison of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the proprietress
of the house--a drunken face tied up in a black bundle, and flaring
out of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog-hutch which is her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
private apartment--leads to the establishment of this conclusion.
Toughy has gone to the doctor's to get a bottle of stuff for a sick
woman but will be here anon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who have we got here to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, opening another
door and glaring in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bull's-eye. <div class="bookquote">``Two drunken men, eh? And
two women? The men are sound enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>each sleeper</b></font>)</div>turning back each sleeper's arm
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Are these your good men, my dears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>returns one of the women. <div class="bookquote">``They are our husbands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brickmakers, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here? You don't belong to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. We belong to Hertfordshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whereabouts in Hertfordshire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saint Albans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come up on the tramp?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We walked up yesterday. There's no work down with us at present, but
we have done no good by coming here, and shall do none, I expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not the way to do much good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
head in the direction of the unconscious figures on the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It an't indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replies the woman with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Jenny and me knows
it full well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the visitors</b></font>)</div><p/>The room, though two or three feet higher than the door, is so low
that the head of the tallest of the visitors would touch the
blackened ceiling if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stood upright. It is offensive to every
sense; even the gross candle burns pale and sickly in the polluted
air. There are a couple of benches and a higher bench by way of
table. The men lie asleep where they stumbled down, but the women sit
by the candle. Lying in the arms of the woman who has spoken is a
very young child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what age do you call that little creature?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``It
looks as if it was born yesterday.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is not at all rough about it;
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) light gently on the infant, Mr. Snagsby is
strangely reminded of another infant, encircled with light, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
has seen in pictures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) is not three weeks old yet, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>says the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) your child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The other woman, who was bending over it when they came in, stoops
down again and kisses it as it lies asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem as fond of it as if you were the mother yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was the mother of one like it, master, and it died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Jenny, Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>says the other woman to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Better so. Much
better to think of dead than alive, Jenny! Much better!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you an't such an unnatural woman, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Bucket
sternly, <div class="bookquote">``as to wish your own child dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows you are right, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returns. <div class="bookquote">``I am not. I'd stand
between it and death with my own life if I could, as true as any
pretty lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't talk in that wrong manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, mollified
again. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's brought into my head, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman eyes</b></font>)</div>returns the woman, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes
filling with tears, <div class="bookquote">``when I look down at the child lying so. If it
was never to wake no more, you'd think me mad, I should take on so. I
know that very well. I was with Jenny when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lost hers--warn't I,
Jenny?--and I know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) grieved. But look around you at this
place. Look at them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman eyes</b></font>)</div>glancing at the sleepers on the ground. <div class="bookquote">``Look
at the boy you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn.
Think of the children that your business lays with often and often,
and that YOU see grow up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``you train him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) respectable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll
be a comfort to you, and look after you in your old age, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to try hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answers, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``But I have been
a-thinking, being over-tired to-night and not well with the ague, of
all the many things that'll come in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way. My master will be
against it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'ll be beat, and see me beat, and made to fear his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
home, and perhaps to stray wild. If I work for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ever so much, and
ever so hard, there's no one to help me; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) should be turned
bad `spite of all I could do, and the time should come when I should
sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sleep, made hard and changed, an't it likely I
should think of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lies in my lap now and wish he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had died as
Jenny's child died!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny/Will Jenny</b></font>)</div>says Jenny. <div class="bookquote">``Liz, you're tired and ill. Let me take
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In doing so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) displaces the mother's dress, but quickly readjusts
it over the wounded and bruised bosom where the baby has been lying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my dead child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny/Will Jenny</b></font>)</div>says Jenny, walking up and down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) nurses,
<div class="bookquote">``that makes me love this child so dear, and it's my dead child that
makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) love it so dear too, as even to think of its being taken
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) now. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) thinks that, I think what fortune would
I give to have my darling back. But we mean the same thing, if we
knew how to say it, us two mothers does in our poor hearts!''

 (<font color='red'><b>nurses</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Snagsby blows his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) nose and coughs his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of sympathy, a
step is heard without. Mr. Bucket throws his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) light into the doorway
and says to Mr. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``Now, what do you say to Toughy? Will HE (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby.

<p/>Jo stands amazed in the disk of light, like a ragged figure in a
magic-lantern, trembling to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has offended against the
law in not having moved on far enough. Mr. Snagsby, however, giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) the consolatory assurance, <div class="bookquote">``It's only a job you will be paid for,
Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) recovers; and on being taken outside by Mr. Bucket for a
little private confabulation, tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tale satisfactorily, though
out of breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have squared it with the lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, returning, <div class="bookquote">``and
it's all right. Now, Mr. Snagsby, we're ready for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>First, Jo has to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) errand of good nature by handing over
the physic he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has been to get, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) delivers with the laconic
verbal direction that <div class="bookquote">``it's to be all took d'rectly.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Secondly, Mr.
Snagsby has to lay upon the table half a crown, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) usual panacea for
an immense variety of afflictions. Thirdly, Mr. Bucket has to take Jo
by the arm a little above the elbow and walk him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) on before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>),
without which observance neither the Tough Subject nor any other
Subject could be professionally conducted to Lincoln's Inn Fields.
These arrangements completed, they give the women good night and come
out once more into black and foul Tom-all-Alone's.

<p/>By the noisome ways through which they descended into that pit, they
gradually emerge from it, the crowd flitting, and whistling, and
skulking about them until they come to the verge, where restoration
of the bull's-eyes is made to Darby. Here the crowd, like a concourse
of imprisoned demons, turns back, yelling, and is seen no more.
Through the clearer and fresher streets, never so clear and fresh to
Mr. Snagsby's mind as now, they walk and ride until they come to Mr.
Tulkinghorn's gate.

<p/>As they ascend the dim stairs -LRB-Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers being on
the first floor-RRB-, Mr. Bucket mentions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) has the key of the
outer door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) pocket and that there is no need to ring. For a man
so expert in most things of that kind, Bucket takes time to open the
door and makes some noise too. It may be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) sounds a note of
preparation.

<p/>Howbeit, they come at last into the hall, where a lamp is burning,
and so into Mr. Tulkinghorn's usual room--the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
old wine to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is not there, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) two old-fashioned
candlesticks are, and the room is tolerably light.

<p/>Mr. Bucket, still having his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) professional hold of Jo and appearing to
Mr. Snagsby to possess an unlimited number of eyes, makes a little
way into this room, when Jo starts and stops.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>cries Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A female figure, closely veiled, stands in the middle of the room,
where the light falls upon it. It is quite still and silent. The
front of the figure is towards them, but it takes no notice of their
entrance and remains like a statue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket aloud, <div class="bookquote">``how you know that to be the
lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the wale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replies Jo, staring, <div class="bookquote">``and the bonnet, and the
gownd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quite sure of what you say, Tough,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>returns Bucket, narrowly
observant of him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Look again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a-looking as hard as ever I can look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo with starting
eyes, <div class="bookquote">``and that there's the wale, the bonnet, and the gownd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about those rings you told me of?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A-sparkling all over here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, rubbing the fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) left
hand on the knuckles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) right without taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eyes from the
figure.

<p/>The figure removes the right-hand glove and shows the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what do you say to that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks Bucket.

<p/>Jo shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Not rings a bit like them. Not a hand like
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Bucket, evidently pleased though, and
well pleased too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hand was a deal whiter, a deal delicater, and a deal smaller,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>returns Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you'll tell me I'm my own mother next,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you recollect the lady's voice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/>The figure speaks. <div class="bookquote">``Was it at all like this? I will speak as long as
you like if you are not sure. Was it this voice, or at all like this
voice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo looks aghast at Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, what,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorts that worthy, pointing to the figure, <div class="bookquote">``did you
say it was the lady for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cos,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) certainty, <div class="bookquote">``cos that there's the wale, the bonnet, and the
gownd. It is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and it an't her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). It an't her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, nor yet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
rings, nor yet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) woice. But that there's the wale, the bonnet, and
the gownd, and they're wore the same way wot she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore 'em, and it's
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) height wot she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wos, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) giv me a sov`ring and hooked it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket slightly, <div class="bookquote">``we haven't got much good out of
YOU. But, however, here's five shillings for you. Take care how you
spend it, and don't get yourself into trouble.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Bucket stealthily
tells the coins from one hand into the other like counters--which is
a way he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) principal use of them being in these games of
skill--and then puts them, in a little pile, into the boy's hand and
takes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out to the door, leaving Mr. Snagsby, not by any means
comfortable under these mysterious circumstances, alone with the
veiled figure. But on Mr. Tulkinghorn's coming into the room, the
veil is raised and a sufficiently good-looking Frenchwoman is
revealed, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) expression is something of the intensest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mademoiselle Hortense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
usual equanimity. <div class="bookquote">``I will give you no further trouble about this
little wager.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will do me the kindness to remember, sir, that I am not at
present placed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says mademoiselle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, certainly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished
recommendation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means, Mademoiselle Hortense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A word from Mr. Tulkinghorn is so powerful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall not be wanting, mademoiselle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Receive the assurance of my devoted gratitude, dear sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle goes out with an air of native gentility; and Mr.
Bucket, to whom it is, on an emergency, as natural to be groom of the
ceremonies as it is to be anything else, shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) downstairs, not
without gallantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bucket?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>quoth Mr. Tulkinghorn on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all squared, you see, as I squared it myself, sir. There an't a
doubt that it was the other one with this one's dress on. The boy was
exact respecting colours and everything. Mr. Snagsby, I promised you
as a man that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) should be sent away all right. Don't say it wasn't
done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have kept your word, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>returns the stationer; <div class="bookquote">``and if I can
be of no further use, Mr. Tulkinghorn, I think, as my little woman
will be getting anxious--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Snagsby, no further use,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``I am
quite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, sir. I wish you good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Mr. Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to the door
and shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) over and over again, <div class="bookquote">``what I like in you
is that you're a man it's of no use pumping; that's what YOU are.
When you know you have done a right thing, you put it away, and it's
done with and gone, and there's an end of it. That's what YOU do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is certainly what I endeavour to do, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you don't do yourself justice. It an't what you endeavour to
do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and blessing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in the
tenderest manner, <div class="bookquote">``it's what you DO. That's what I estimate in a man
in your way of business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby makes a suitable response and goes homeward so confused
by the events of the evening that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is doubtful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) being awake
and out--doubtful of the reality of the streets through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
goes--doubtful of the reality of the moon that shines above him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
is presently reassured on these subjects by the unchallengeable
reality of Mrs. Snagsby, sitting up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head in a perfect
beehive of curl-papers and night-cap, who has dispatched Guster to
the police-station with official intelligence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) husband's being
made away with, and who within the last two hours has passed through
every stage of swooning with the greatest decorum. But as the little
woman feelingly says, many thanks she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gets for it!




<p/>CHAPTER XXIII

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>We came home from Mr. Boythorn's after six pleasant weeks. We were
often in the park and in the woods and seldom passed the lodge where
we had taken shelter without looking in to speak to the keeper's
wife; but we saw no more of Lady Dedlock, except at church on
Sundays. There was company at Chesney Wold; and although several
beautiful faces surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) face retained the same influence
on me as at first. I do not quite know even now whether it was
painful or pleasurable, whether it drew me towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) or made me
shrink from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). I think I admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) with a kind of fear, and I
know that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) presence my thoughts always wandered back, as they
had done at first, to that old time of my life.

<p/>I had a fancy, on more than one of these Sundays, that what this lady
so curiously was to me, I was to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--I mean that I disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
thoughts as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) influenced mine, though in some different way. But
when I stole a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so composed and distant and
unapproachable, I felt this to be a foolish weakness. Indeed, I felt
the whole state of my mind in reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be weak and
unreasonable, and I remonstrated with myself about it as much as I
could.

<p/>One incident that occurred before we quitted Mr. Boythorn's house, I
had better mention in this place.

<p/>I was walking in the garden with Ada when I was told that some one
wished to see me. Going into the breakfast-room where this person was
waiting, I found it to be the French maid who had cast off her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) shoes
and walked through the wet grass on the day when it thundered and
lightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) began, looking fixedly at me with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) too-eager
eyes, though otherwise presenting an agreeable appearance and
speaking neither with boldness nor servility, <div class="bookquote">``I have taken a great
liberty in coming here, but you know how to excuse it, being so
amiable, mademoiselle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No excuse is necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``if you wish to speak to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my desire, mademoiselle. A thousand thanks for the
permission. I have your leave to speak. Is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said in a
quick, natural way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, you are so amiable! Listen then, if you please. I have
left my Lady. We could not agree. My Lady is so high, so very high.
Pardon! Mademoiselle, you are right!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) quickness anticipated what
I might have said presently but as yet had only thought. <div class="bookquote">``It is not
for me to come here to complain of my Lady. But I say she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is so high,
so very high. I will not say a word more. All the world knows that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly; mademoiselle, I am thankful for your politeness.
Mademoiselle, I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a
young lady who is good, accomplished, beautiful. You are good,
accomplished, and beautiful as an angel. Ah, could I have the honour
of being your domestic!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not dismiss me so soon, mademoiselle!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said with an
involuntary contraction of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) fine black eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``Let me hope a
moment! Mademoiselle, I know this service would be more retired than
that which I have quitted. Well! I wish that. I know this service
would be less distinguished than that which I have quitted. Well! I
wish that, I know that I should win less, as to wages here. Good. I
am content.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, quite embarrassed by the mere idea of having
such an attendant, <div class="bookquote">``that I keep no maid--''

 (<font color='red'><b>an attendant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, mademoiselle, but why not? Why not, when you can have one so
devoted to you! Who would be enchanted to serve you; who would be so
true, so zealous, and so faithful every day! Mademoiselle, I wish
with all my heart to serve you. Do not speak of money at present.
Take me as I am. For nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>an attendant</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was so singularly earnest that I drew back, almost afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
Without appearing to notice it, in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) ardour she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) still pressed
herself upon me, speaking in a rapid subdued voice, though always
with a certain grace and propriety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, I come from the South country where we are quick and
where we like and dislike very strong. My Lady was too high for me; I
was too high for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). It is done--past--finished! Receive me as your
domestic, and I will serve you well. I will do more for you than you
figure to yourself now. Chut! Mademoiselle, I will--no matter, I will
do my utmost possible in all things. If you accept my service, you
will not repent it. Mademoiselle, you will not repent it, and I will
serve you well. You don't know how well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a lowering energy in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stood looking at me
while I explained the impossibility of my engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) -LRB-without
thinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so-RRB-,
which seemed to bring visibly before me some woman from the streets
of Paris in the reign of terror.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard me out without interruption and then said with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretty
accent and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mildest voice, <div class="bookquote">``Hey, mademoiselle, I have received
my answer! I am sorry of it. But I must go elsewhere and seek what I
have not found here. Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at me more intently as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took it, and seemed to take
note, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) momentary touch, of every vein in it. <div class="bookquote">``I fear I
surprised you, mademoiselle, on the day of the storm?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said with
a parting curtsy.

<p/>I confessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had surprised us all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I took an oath, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``and I wanted to
stamp it on my mind so that I might keep it faithfully. And I will!
Adieu, mademoiselle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So ended our conference, which I was very glad to bring to a close. I
supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went away from the village, for I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no more; and
nothing else occurred to disturb our tranquil summer pleasures until
six weeks were out and we returned home as I began just now by
saying.

<p/>At that time, and for a good many weeks after that time, Richard was
constant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) visits. Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and
remaining with us until Monday morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sometimes rode out on
horseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back
again early next day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was as vivacious as ever and told us he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was
very industrious, but I was not easy in my mind about him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). It
appeared to me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) industry was all misdirected. I could not
find that it led to anything but the formation of delusive hopes in
connexion with the suit already the pernicious cause of so much
sorrow and ruin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had got at the core of that mystery now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) told
us, and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
and Ada were to take I don't know how many thousands of pounds must
be finally established if there were any sense or justice in the
Court of Chancery--but oh, what a great IF that sounded in my
ears--and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer
delayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) proved this to himself by all the weary arguments on that
side he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had read, and every one of them sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) deeper in the
infatuation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had even begun to haunt the court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) told us how he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
saw Miss Flite there daily, how they talked together, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) did
her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) little kindnesses, and how, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) pitied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) heart. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) never thought--never, my poor, dear,
sanguine Richard, capable of so much happiness then, and with such
better things before him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)--what a fatal link was riveting between his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
fresh youth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) faded age, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) free hopes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) caged
birds, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hungry garret, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wandering mind.

<p/>Ada loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) too well to mistrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) much in anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said or
did, and my guardian, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) frequently complained of the east
wind and read more than usual in the growlery, preserved a strict
silence on the subject. So I thought one day when I went to London to
meet Caddy Jellyby, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) solicitation, I would ask Richard to be in
waiting for me at the coach-office, that we might have a little talk
together. I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) there when I arrived, and we walked away arm in
arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I as soon as I could begin to be grave with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you beginning to feel more settled now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard. <div class="bookquote">``I'm all right enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But settled?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, settled?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Richard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gay laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Settled in the law,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>replied Richard, <div class="bookquote">``I'm all right enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said that before, my dear Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't think it's an answer, eh? Well! Perhaps it's not.
Settled? You mean, do I feel as if I were settling down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no, I can't say I am settling down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, strongly
emphasizing <div class="bookquote">``down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>as if that expressed the difficulty, <div class="bookquote">``because one
can't settle down while this business remains in such an unsettled
state. When I say this business, of course I mean the--forbidden
subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it will ever be in a settled state?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>answered Richard.

<p/>We walked a little way without speaking, and presently Richard
addressed me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) frankest and most feeling manner, thus: <div class="bookquote">``My dear
Esther, I understand you, and I wish to heaven I were a more constant
sort of fellow. I don't mean constant to Ada, for I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
dearly--better and better every day--but constant to myself.
-LRB-Somehow, I mean something that I can't very well express, but you'll
make it out.-RRB- If I were a more constant sort of fellow, I should have
held on either to Badger or to Kenge and Carboy like grim death, and
should have begun to be steady and systematic by this time, and
shouldn't be in debt, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``ARE you in debt, Richard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``I am a little so, my dear. Also, I have taken
rather too much to billiards and that sort of thing. Now the murder's
out; you despise me, Esther, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are kinder to me than I often am to myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``My
dear Esther, I am a very unfortunate dog not to be more settled, but
how CAN I be more settled? If you lived in an unfinished house, you
couldn't settle down in it; if you were condemned to leave everything
you undertook unfinished, you would find it hard to apply yourself to
anything; and yet that's my unhappy case. I was born into this
unfinished contention with all its chances and changes, and it began
to unsettle me before I quite knew the difference between a suit at
law and a suit of clothes; and it has gone on unsettling me ever
since; and here I am now, conscious sometimes that I am but a
worthless fellow to love my confiding cousin Ada.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We were in a solitary place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hands before his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) eyes and
sobbed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said the words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Do not be so moved. You have a noble nature,
and Ada's love may make you worthier every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) replied, pressing my arm, <div class="bookquote">``I know all that. You
mustn't mind my being a little soft now, for I have had all this upon
my mind for a long time, and have often meant to speak to you, and
have sometimes wanted opportunity and sometimes courage. I know what
the thought of Ada ought to do for me, but it doesn't do it. I am too
unsettled even for that. I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) most devotedly, and yet I do her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
wrong, in doing myself wrong, every day and hour. But it can't last
for ever. We shall come on for a final hearing and get judgment in
our favour, and then you and Ada shall see what I can really be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It had given me a pang to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sob and see the tears start out
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fingers, but that was infinitely less affecting to me
than the hopeful animation with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said these words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have looked well into the papers, Esther. I have been deep in them
for months,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) continued, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) cheerfulness in a moment,
<div class="bookquote">``and you may rely upon it that we shall come out triumphant. As to
years of delay, there has been no want of them, heaven knows! And
there is the greater probability of our bringing the matter to a
speedy close; in fact, it's on the paper now. It will be all right at
last, and then you shall see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Recalling how he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had just now placed Messrs. Kenge and Carboy in the
same category with Mr. Badger, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) intended to be
articled in Lincoln's Inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There again! I think not at all, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) returned with an
effort. <div class="bookquote">``I fancy I have had enough of it. Having worked at Jarndyce
and Jarndyce like a galley slave, I have slaked my thirst for the law
and satisfied myself that I shouldn't like it. Besides, I find it
unsettles me more and more to be so constantly upon the scene of
action. So what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>continued Richard, confident again by this time,
<div class="bookquote">``do I naturally turn my thoughts to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look so serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, <div class="bookquote">``because it's the best
thing I can do, my dear Esther, I am certain. It's not as if I wanted
a profession for life. These proceedings will come to a termination,
and then I am provided for. No. I look upon it as a pursuit which is
in its nature more or less unsettled, and therefore suited to my
temporary condition--I may say, precisely suited. What is it that I
naturally turn my thoughts to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and shook my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, in a tone of perfect conviction, <div class="bookquote">``but the
army!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The army?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The army, of course. What I have to do is to get a commission;
and--there I am, you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) showed me, proved by elaborate calculations in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
pocket-book, that supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had contracted, say, two hundred
pounds of debt in six months out of the army; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) contracted
no debt at all within a corresponding period in the army--as to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had quite made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind; this step must involve a saving of
four hundred pounds in a year, or two thousand pounds in five years,
which was a considerable sum. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) spoke so ingenuously and
sincerely of the sacrifice he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) made in withdrawing himself for a time
from Ada, and of the earnestness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) aspired--as in thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) always did, I know full well--to repay her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) love, and to ensure her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
happiness, and to conquer what was amiss in himself, and to acquire
the very soul of decision, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) made my heart ache keenly, sorely.
For, I thought, how would this end, how could this end, when so soon
and so surely all his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) manly qualities were touched by the fatal
blight that ruined everything it rested on!

<p/>I spoke to Richard with all the earnestness I felt, and all the hope
I could not quite feel then, and implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) for Ada's sake not to
put any trust in Chancery. To all I said, Richard readily assented,
riding over the court and everything else in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) easy way and drawing
the brightest pictures of the character he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was to settle into--alas,
when the grievous suit should loose its hold upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)! We had a long
talk, but it always came back to that, in substance.

<p/>At last we came to Soho Square, where Caddy Jellyby had appointed to
wait for me, as a quiet place in the neighbourhood of Newman Street.
Caddy was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I
appeared. After a few cheerful words, Richard left us together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prince has a pupil over the way, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``and got the
key for us. So if you will walk round and round here with me, we can
lock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see
your dear good face about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing could be better.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>So Caddy,
after affectionately squeezing the dear good face as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) called it,
locked the gate, and took my arm, and we began to walk round the
garden very cosily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, who thoroughly enjoyed a little
confidence, <div class="bookquote">``after you spoke to me about its being wrong to marry
without Ma's knowledge, or even to keep Ma long in the dark
respecting our engagement--though I don't believe Ma cares much for
me, I must say--I thought it right to mention your opinions to
Prince. In the first place because I want to profit by everything you
tell me, and in the second place because I have no secrets from
Prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) approved, Caddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear! I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would approve of anything you could
say. You have no idea what an opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, it's enough to make anybody but me jealous,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy,
laughing and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``but it only makes me joyful, for you
are the first friend I ever had, and the best friend I ever can have,
and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you are in the general conspiracy to
keep me in a good humour. Well, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I am going to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Caddy, crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands
confidentially upon my arm. ``So we talked a good deal about it, and
so I said to Prince, <div class="bookquote">``Prince, as Miss Summerson--'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Miss Summerson/Esther Summerson</b></font>)</div><p/>``I hope you didn't say <div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Miss Summerson/Esther Summerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I didn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Caddy, greatly pleased and with the brightest
of faces. ``I said, ``Esther.'' I said to Prince, ``As Esther is
decidedly of that opinion, Prince, and has expressed it to me, and
always hints it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) writes those kind notes, which you are so
fond of hearing me read to you, I am prepared to disclose the truth
to Ma whenever you think proper. And I think, Prince,<div class="bookquote">'' said I, `that
Esther thinks that I should be in a better, and truer, and more
honourable position altogether if you did the same to your papa.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Esther certainly does think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I was right, you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``Well! This troubled
Prince a good deal, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had the least doubt about it, but
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is so considerate of the feelings of old Mr. Turveydrop;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) apprehensions that old Mr. Turveydrop might break his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
heart, or faint away, or be very much overcome in some affecting
manner or other if he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) made such an announcement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) feared old Mr.
Turveydrop might consider it undutiful and might receive too great a
shock. For old Mr. Turveydrop's deportment is very beautiful, you
know, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) feelings are extremely
sensitive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, extremely sensitive. Prince says so. Now, this has caused my
darling child--I didn't mean to use the expression to you, Esther,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Caddy apologized, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face suffused with blushes, <div class="bookquote">``but I generally
call Prince my darling child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I laughed; and Caddy laughed and blushed, and went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This has caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), Esther--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caused whom, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you tiresome thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, laughing, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) pretty face
on fire. ``My darling child, if you insist upon it! This has caused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) weeks of uneasiness and has made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) delay, from day to day, in a
very anxious manner. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said to me, ``Caddy, if Miss
Summerson, who is a great favourite with my father, could be
prevailed upon to be present when I broke the subject, I think I
could do it.<div class="bookquote">'' So I promised I would ask you. And I made up my mind,
besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, looking at me hopefully but timidly, <div class="bookquote">``that if
you consented, I would ask you afterwards to come with me to Ma. This
is what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and
a great assistance to beg of you. And if you thought you could grant
it, Esther, we should both be very grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see, Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, pretending to consider. <div class="bookquote">``Really, I think
I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing. I am
at your service and the darling child's, my dear, whenever you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Caddy was quite transported by this reply of mine, being, I believe,
as susceptible to the least kindness or encouragement as any tender
heart that ever beat in this world; and after another turn or two
round the garden, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) put on an entirely new pair of
gloves and made herself as resplendent as possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) might do
no avoidable discredit to the Master of Deportment, we went to Newman
Street direct.

<p/>Prince was teaching, of course. We found him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) engaged with a not very
hopeful pupil--a stubborn little girl with a sulky forehead, a deep
voice, and an inanimate, dissatisfied mama--whose case was certainly
not rendered more hopeful by the confusion into which we threw her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>)
preceptor. The lesson at last came to an end, after proceeding as
discordantly as possible; and when the little girl had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
shoes and had had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) white muslin extinguished in shawls, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
taken away. After a few words of preparation, we then went in search
of Mr. Turveydrop, whom we found, grouped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) hat and gloves, as
a model of deportment, on the sofa in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) private apartment--the only
comfortable room in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) appeared to have dressed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
leisure in the intervals of a light collation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) dressing-case,
brushes, and so forth, all of quite an elegant kind, lay about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, Miss Summerson; Miss Jellyby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charmed! Enchanted!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, rising with his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
high-shouldered bow. <div class="bookquote">``Permit me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Handing chairs. <div class="bookquote">``Be seated!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Kissing the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) left fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Overjoyed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) eyes
and rolling. <div class="bookquote">``My little retreat is made a paradise.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Recomposing
himself on the sofa like the second gentleman in Europe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again you find us, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``using our little arts
to polish, polish! Again the sex stimulates us and rewards us by the
condescension of its lovely presence. It is much in these times -LRB-and
we have made an awfully degenerating business of it since the days of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) Royal Highness the Prince Regent--my patron, if I may presume to
say so-RRB- to experience that deportment is not wholly trodden under
foot by mechanics. That it can yet bask in the smile of beauty, my
dear madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I said nothing, which I thought a suitable reply; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) took a pinch
of snuff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``you have four schools this
afternoon. I would recommend a hasty sandwich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>returned Prince, <div class="bookquote">``I will be sure to be punctual.

going to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the model, pale and aghast as Prince and
Caddy, hand in hand, bent down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What is this? Is this
lunacy! Or what is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>returned Prince with great submission, <div class="bookquote">``I love this young
lady, and we are engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Engaged!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Turveydrop, reclining on the sofa and shutting
out the sight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``An arrow launched at my brain by my own
child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been engaged for some time, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>faltered Prince, <div class="bookquote">``and
Miss Summerson, hearing of it, advised that we should declare the
fact to you and was so very kind as to attend on the present
occasion. Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you,
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Turveydrop uttered a groan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, pray don't! Pray don't, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>urged his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Jellyby is
a young lady who deeply respects you, and our first desire is to
consider your comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Turveydrop sobbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, pray don't, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``it is well that your sainted mother is
spared this pang. Strike deep, and spare not. Strike home, sir,
strike home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't say so, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>implored Prince, in tears. <div class="bookquote">``It goes to
my heart. I do assure you, father, that our first wish and intention
is to consider your comfort. Caroline and I do not forget our
duty--what is my duty is Caroline's, as we have often said
together--and with your approval and consent, father, we will devote
ourselves to making your life agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strike home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR.

to listen, I thought, too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>returned Prince, <div class="bookquote">``we well know what little comforts
you are accustomed to and have a right to, and it will always be our
study and our pride to provide those before anything. If you will
bless us with your approval and consent, father, we shall not think
of being married until it is quite agreeable to you; and when we ARE
married, we shall always make you--of course--our first
consideration. You must ever be the head and master here, father; and
we feel how truly unnatural it would be in us if we failed to know it
or if we failed to exert ourselves in every possible way to please
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Turveydrop underwent a severe internal struggle and came upright
on the sofa again with his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) cheeks puffing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) stiff cravat, a
perfect model of parental deportment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop. <div class="bookquote">``My children! I cannot resist your
prayer. Be happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) benignity as he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) future daughter-in-law and stretched
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son -LRB-who kissed it with affectionate respect and
gratitude-RRB- was the most confusing sight I ever saw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, paternally encircling Caddy with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) left arm as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>), and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) right hand
gracefully on his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) hip. <div class="bookquote">``My son and daughter, your happiness shall be
my care. I will watch over you. You shall always live with
me'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--meaning, of course, I will always live with you--<div class="bookquote">``this house is
henceforth as much yours as mine; consider it your home. May you long
live to share it with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) deportment was such that they really were as much
overcome with thankfulness as if, instead of quartering himself upon
them for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) were making some munificent
sacrifice in their favour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For myself, my children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``I am falling into
the sear and yellow leaf, and it is impossible to say how long the
last feeble traces of gentlemanly deportment may linger in this
weaving and spinning age. But, so long, I will do my duty to society
and will show myself, as usual, about town. My wants are few and
simple. My little apartment here, my few essentials for the toilet,
my frugal morning meal, and my little dinner will suffice. I charge
your dutiful affection with the supply of these requirements, and I
charge myself with all the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>They were overpowered afresh by his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) uncommon generosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``for those little points in which you
are deficient--points of deportment, which are born with a man, which
may be improved by cultivation, but can never be originated--you may
still rely on me. I have been faithful to my post since the days of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and I will not desert it now.
No, my son. If you have ever contemplated your father's poor position
with a feeling of pride, you may rest assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will do nothing
to tarnish it. For yourself, Prince, whose character is different -LRB-we
cannot be all alike, nor is it advisable that we should-RRB-, work, be
industrious, earn money, and extend the connexion as much as
possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you may depend I will do, dear father, with all my heart,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>replied Prince.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop. <div class="bookquote">``Your qualities are not
shining, my dear child, but they are steady and useful. And to both
of you, my children, I would merely observe, in the spirit of a
sainted wooman on whose path I had the happiness of casting, I
believe, SOME ray of light, take care of the establishment, take care
of my simple wants, and bless you both!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>Old Mr. Turveydrop then became so very gallant, in honour of the
occasion, that I told Caddy we must really go to Thavies Inn at once
if we were to go at all that day. So we took our departure after a
very loving farewell between Caddy and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) betrothed, and during our
walk she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was so happy and so full of old Mr. Turveydrop's praises
that I would not have said a word in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) disparagement for any
consideration.

<p/>The house in Thavies Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it
was to let, and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than
ever. The name of poor Mr. Jellyby had appeared in the list of
bankrupts but a day or two before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was shut up in the
dining-room with two gentlemen and a heap of blue bags,
account-books, and papers, making the most desperate endeavours to
understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) affairs. They appeared to me to be quite beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
comprehension, for when Caddy took me into the dining-room by mistake
and we came upon Mr. Jellyby in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) spectacles, forlornly fenced into
a corner by the great dining-table and the two gentlemen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) seemed
to have given up the whole thing and to be speechless and insensible.

<p/>Going upstairs to Mrs. Jellyby's room -LRB-the children were all
screaming in the kitchen, and there was no servant to be seen-RRB-, we
found that lady in the midst of a voluminous correspondence, opening,
reading, and sorting letters, with a great accumulation of torn
covers on the floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so preoccupied that at first she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not
know me, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat looking at me with that curious, bright-eyed,
far-off look of hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Miss Summerson!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of something
so different! I hope you are well. I am happy to see you. Mr.
Jarndyce and Miss Clare quite well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hoped in return that Mr. Jellyby was quite well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, not quite, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby in the calmest manner.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) has been unfortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) affairs and is a little out of
spirits. Happily for me, I am so much engaged that I have no time to
think about it. We have, at the present moment, one hundred and
seventy families, Miss Summerson, averaging five persons in each,
either gone or going to the left bank of the Niger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought of the one family so near us who were neither gone nor
going to the left bank of the Niger, and wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) could be so
placid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have brought Caddy back, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Jellyby with a
glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) daughter. <div class="bookquote">``It has become quite a novelty to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)
here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) has almost deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) old employment and in fact obliges
me to employ a boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure, Ma--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began Caddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you know, Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mother mildly interposed, <div class="bookquote">``that I DO
employ a boy, who is now at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dinner. What is the use of your
contradicting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not going to contradict, Ma,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``I was only
going to say that surely you wouldn't have me be a mere drudge all my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, still opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) letters,
casting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) bright eyes smilingly over them, and sorting them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
spoke, <div class="bookquote">``that you have a business example before you in your mother.
Besides. A mere drudge? If you had any sympathy with the destinies of
the human race, it would raise you high above any such idea. But you
have none. I have often told you, Caddy, you have no such sympathy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if it's Africa, Ma, I have not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have not. Now, if I were not happily so much engaged,
Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, sweetly casting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) eyes for a
moment on me and considering where to put the particular letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
had just opened, <div class="bookquote">``this would distress and disappoint me. But I have
so much to think of, in connexion with Borrioboola-Gha and it is so
necessary I should concentrate myself that there is my remedy, you
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As Caddy gave me a glance of entreaty, and as Mrs. Jellyby was
looking far away into Africa straight through my bonnet and head, I
thought it a good opportunity to come to the subject of my visit and
to attract Mrs. Jellyby's attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, <div class="bookquote">``you will wonder what has brought me here to
interrupt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am always delighted to see Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby,
pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) employment with a placid smile. <div class="bookquote">``Though I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) was more interested in the Borrioboolan
project.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come with Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``because Caddy justly thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)
ought not to have a secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) mother and fancies I shall
encourage and aid her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) -LRB-though I am sure I don't know how-RRB- in
imparting one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, pausing for a moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) occupation
and then serenely pursuing it after shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``you are going
to tell me some nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Caddy untied the strings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) bonnet, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) bonnet off, and
letting it dangle on the floor by the strings, and crying heartily,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Ma, I am engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you ridiculous child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Jellyby with an abstracted
air as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) looked over the dispatch last opened; <div class="bookquote">``what a goose you
are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am engaged, Ma,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``to young Mr. Turveydrop, at the
academy; and old Mr. Turveydrop -LRB-who is a very gentlemanly man
indeed-RRB- has given his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) consent, and I beg and pray you'll give us
yours, Ma, because I never could be happy without it. I never, never
could!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Caddy, quite forgetful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) general complainings and
of everything but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) natural affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see again, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely,
<div class="bookquote">``what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am and to have
this necessity for self-concentration that I have. Here is Caddy
engaged to a dancing-master's son--mixed up with people who have no
more sympathy with the destinies of the human race than she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) has
herself! This, too, when Mr. Quale, one of the first philanthropists
of our time, has mentioned to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) was really disposed to be
interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ma, I always hated and detested Mr. Quale!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Caddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Caddy, Caddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Jellyby, opening another letter with
the greatest complacency. <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt you did. How could you do
otherwise, being totally destitute of the sympathies with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>)
overflows! Now, if my public duties were not a favourite child to me,
if I were not occupied with large measures on a vast scale, these
petty details might grieve me very much, Miss Summerson. But can I
permit the film of a silly proceeding on the part of Caddy -LRB-from whom
I expect nothing else-RRB- to interpose between me and the great African
continent? No. No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Jellyby in a calm clear voice, and
with an agreeable smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) opened more letters and sorted them.
<div class="bookquote">``No, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was so unprepared for the perfect coolness of this reception,
though I might have expected it, that I did not know what to say.
Caddy seemed equally at a loss. Mrs. Jellyby continued to open and
sort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of
voice and with a smile of perfect composure, <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, Ma,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed poor Caddy at last, <div class="bookquote">``you are not angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Caddy, you really are an absurd girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Jellyby,
<div class="bookquote">``to ask such questions after what I have said of the preoccupation of
my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope, Ma, you give us your consent and wish us well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Caddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a nonsensical child to have done anything of this kind,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby; <div class="bookquote">``and a degenerate child, when you might have
devoted yourself to the great public measure. But the step is taken,

Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, for Caddy was kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``don't delay me
in my work, but let me clear off this heavy batch of papers before
the afternoon post comes in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought I could not do better than take my leave; I was detained
for a moment by Caddy's saying, <div class="bookquote">``You won't object to my bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
to see you, Ma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me, Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jellyby, who had relapsed into that
distant contemplation, <div class="bookquote">``have you begun again? Bring whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Ma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caddy, Caddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, quite weary of such little
matters. <div class="bookquote">``Then you must bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) some evening which is not a Parent
Society night, or a Branch night, or a Ramification night. You must
accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time. My dear Miss
Summerson, it was very kind of you to come here to help out this
silly chit. Good-bye! When I tell you that I have fifty-eight new
letters from manufacturing families anxious to understand the details
of the native and coffee-cultivation question this morning, I need
not apologize for having very little leisure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was not surprised by Caddy's being in low spirits when we went
downstairs, or by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) sobbing afresh on my neck, or by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
would far rather have been scolded than treated with such
indifference, or by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) confiding to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was so poor in
clothes that how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was ever to be married creditably she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) didn't
know. I gradually cheered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) up by dwelling on the many things she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
would do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) unfortunate father and for Peepy when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had a home
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) own; and finally we went downstairs into the damp dark
kitchen, where Peepy and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little brothers and sisters were
grovelling on the stone floor and where we had such a game of play
with them that to prevent myself from being quite torn to pieces I
was obliged to fall back on my fairy-tales. From time to time I heard
loud voices in the parlour overhead, and occasionally a violent
tumbling about of the furniture. The last effect I am afraid was
caused by poor Mr. Jellyby's breaking away from the dining-table and
making rushes at the window with the intention of throwing himself
into the area whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) made any new attempt to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
affairs.

<p/>As I rode quietly home at night after the day's bustle, I thought a
good deal of Caddy's engagement and felt confirmed in my hopes -LRB-in
spite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop-RRB- that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would be the happier and
better for it. And if there seemed to be but a slender chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) husband ever finding out what the model of deportment really
was, why that was all for the best too, and who would wish them to be
wiser? I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half
ashamed of not entirely believing in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) myself. And I looked up at
the stars, and thought about travellers in distant countries and the
stars THEY saw, and hoped I might always be so blest and happy as to
be useful to some one in my small way.

<p/>They were so glad to see me when I got home, as they always were,
that I could have sat down and cried for joy if that had not been a
method of making myself disagreeable. Everybody in the house, from
the lowest to the highest, showed me such a bright face of welcome,
and spoke so cheerily, and was so happy to do anything for me, that I
suppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in the
world.

<p/>We got into such a chatty state that night, through Ada and my
guardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy, that I went on
prose, prose, prosing for a length of time. At last I got up to my
own room, quite red to think how I had been holding forth, and then I
heard a soft tap at my door. So I said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and there came in
a pretty little girl, neatly dressed in mourning, who dropped a
curtsy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl Charley</b></font>)</div>said the little girl in a soft voice, <div class="bookquote">``I am
Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, so you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, stooping down in astonishment and giving
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a kiss. <div class="bookquote">``How glad am I to see you, Charley!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>pursued Charley in the same soft voice, <div class="bookquote">``I'm
your maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, miss, I'm a present to you, with Mr. Jarndyce's
love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I sat down with my hand on Charley's neck and looked at Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And oh, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>says Charley, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, with the tears
starting down her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dimpled cheeks, <div class="bookquote">``Tom's at school, if you please,
and learning so good! And little Emma, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)'s with Mrs. Blinder, miss,
a-being took such care of! And Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have been at school--and
Emma, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have been left with Mrs. Blinder--and me, I should
have been here--all a deal sooner, miss; only Mr. Jarndyce thought
that Tom and Emma and me had better get a little used to parting
first, we was so small. Don't cry, if you please, miss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it, Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss, nor I can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>says Charley. <div class="bookquote">``And if you please,
miss, Mr. Jarndyce's love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) thinks you'll like to teach me now
and then. And if you please, Tom and Emma and me is to see each other
once a month. And I'm so happy and so thankful, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>cried Charley
with a heaving heart, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll try to be such a good maid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Charley dear, never forget who did all this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss, I never will. Nor Tom won't. Nor yet Emma. It was all you,
miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known nothing of it. It was Mr. Jarndyce, Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, but it was all done for the love of you and that you
might be my mistress. If you please, miss, I am a little present with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) love, and it was all done for the love of you. Me and Tom was to
be sure to remember it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley dried her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes and entered on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) functions, going in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
matronly little way about and about the room and folding up
everything she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could lay her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands upon. Presently Charley came
creeping back to my side and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't cry, if you please,
miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>And I said again, <div class="bookquote">``I can't help it, Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And Charley said again, <div class="bookquote">``No, miss, nor I can't help it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>And so,
after all, I did cry for joy indeed, and so did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV

<p/>An Appeal Case


<p/>As soon as Richard and I had held the conversation of which I have
given an account, Richard communicated the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind to Mr.
Jarndyce. I doubt if my guardian were altogether taken by surprise
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) received the representation, though it caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) much
uneasiness and disappointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) and Richard were often closeted
together, late at night and early in the morning, and passed whole
days in London, and had innumerable appointments with Mr. Kenge, and
laboured through a quantity of disagreeable business. While they were
thus employed, my guardian, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) underwent considerable
inconvenience from the state of the wind and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) head so
constantly that not a single hair upon it ever rested in its right
place, was as genial with Ada and me as at any other time, but
maintained a steady reserve on these matters. And as our utmost
endeavours could only elicit from Richard himself sweeping assurances
that everything was going on capitally and that it really was all
right at last, our anxiety was not much relieved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/>We learnt, however, as the time went on, that a new application was
made to the Lord Chancellor on Richard's behalf as an infant and a
ward, and I don't know what, and that there was a quantity of
talking, and that the Lord Chancellor described him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) in open court as
a vexatious and capricious infant, and that the matter was adjourned
and readjourned, and referred, and reported on, and petitioned about
until Richard began to doubt -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) told us-RRB- whether, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) entered
the army at all, it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty
years of age. At last an appointment was made for him (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) to see the Lord
Chancellor again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) private room, and there the Lord Chancellor
very seriously reproved him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) for trifling with time and not knowing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) mind--<div class="bookquote">``a pretty good joke, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``from that
quarter!'' (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>--and at last it was settled that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) application should be
granted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) name was entered at the Horse Guards as an applicant for
an ensign's commission; the purchase-money was deposited at an
agent's; and Richard, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) usual characteristic way, plunged into a
violent course of military study and got up at five o'clock every
morning to practise the broadsword exercise.

<p/>Thus, vacation succeeded term, and term succeeded vacation. We
sometimes heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce as being in the paper or out
of the paper, or as being to be mentioned, or as being to be spoken
to; and it came on, and it went off. Richard, who was now in a
professor's house in London, was able to be with us less frequently
than before; my guardian still maintained the same reserve; and so
time passed until the commission was obtained and Richard received
directions with it to join a regiment in Ireland.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening, and had a
long conference with my guardian. Upwards of an hour elapsed before
my guardian put his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head into the room where Ada and I were sitting
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in, my dears!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We went in and found Richard, whom we
had last seen in high spirits, leaning on the chimney-piece looking
mortified and angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rick and I, Ada,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``are not quite of one mind.
Come, come, Rick, put a brighter face upon it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very hard with me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``The harder because
you have been so considerate to me in all other respects and have
done me kindnesses that I can never acknowledge. I never could have
been set right without you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce. <div class="bookquote">``I want to set you more right yet. I
want to set you more right with yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will excuse my saying, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard in a fiery
way, but yet respectfully, <div class="bookquote">``that I think I am the best judge about
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will excuse my saying, my dear Rick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>observed Mr.
Jarndyce with the sweetest cheerfulness and good humour, <div class="bookquote">``that it's
quite natural in you to think so, but I don't think so. I must do my
duty, Rick, or you could never care for me in cool blood; and I hope
you will always care for me, cool and hot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada had turned so pale that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) sit down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) reading-chair
and sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's nothing. Rick and I have only
had a friendly difference, which we must state to you, for you are
the theme. Now you are afraid of what's coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not indeed, cousin John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>replied Ada with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``if it is
to come from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my dear. Do you give me a minute's calm attention,
without looking at Rick. And, little woman, do you likewise. My dear
girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hand on hers as it lay on the side of the
easy-chair, <div class="bookquote">``you recollect the talk we had, we four when the little
woman told me of a little love affair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not likely that either Richard or I can ever forget your
kindness that day, cousin John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I can never forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the easier what I have to say, and so much the easier for us
to agree,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian face</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face irradiated by the
gentleness and honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``Ada, my bird, you should know
that Rick has now chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) profession for the last time. All that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) has of certainty will be expended when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) is fully equipped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)
has exhausted his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)
has planted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true that I have exhausted my present resources, and I am
quite content to know it. But what I have of certainty, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said
Richard, <div class="bookquote">``is not all I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rick, Rick!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) manner,
and in an altered voice, and putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hands as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would have
stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``For the love of God, don't found a hope or
expectation on the family curse! Whatever you do on this side the
grave, never give one lingering glance towards the horrible phantom
that has haunted us so many years. Better to borrow, better to beg,
better to die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We were all startled by the fervour of this warning. Richard bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
lip and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) breath, and glanced at me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) felt, and knew
that I felt too, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) needed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ada, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) cheerfulness,
<div class="bookquote">``these are strong words of advice, but I live in Bleak House and have
seen a sight here. Enough of that. All Richard had to start him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in
the race of life is ventured. I recommend to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and you, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
sake and your own, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) should depart from us with the
understanding that there is no sort of contract between you. I must
go further. I will be plain with you both. You were to confide freely
in me, and I will confide freely in you. I ask you wholly to
relinquish, for the present, any tie but your relationship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better to say at once, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, <div class="bookquote">``that you renounce
all confidence in me and that you advise Ada to do the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better to say nothing of the sort, Rick, because I don't mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I have begun ill, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>retorted Richard. <div class="bookquote">``I HAVE, I
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I hoped you would begin, and how go on, I told you when we spoke
of these things last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and encouraging
manner. <div class="bookquote">``You have not made that beginning yet, but there is a time
for all things, and yours is not gone by; rather, it is just now
fully come. Make a clear beginning altogether. You two -LRB-very young,
my dears-RRB- are cousins. As yet, you are nothing more. What more may
come must come of being worked out, Rick, and no sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very hard with me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``Harder than I could
have supposed you would be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``I am harder with myself when I do
anything that gives you pain. You have your remedy in your own hands.
Ada, it is better for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should be free and that there
should be no youthful engagement between you. Rick, it is better for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), much better; you owe it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). Come! Each of you will do what
is best for the other, if not what is best for yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it best, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard hastily. <div class="bookquote">``It was not when we
opened our hearts to you. You did not say so then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had experience since. I don't blame you, Rick, but I have had
experience since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean of me, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Yes, of both of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce kindly. <div class="bookquote">``The time is
not come for your standing pledged to one another. It is not right,
and I must not recognize it. Come, come, my young cousins, begin
afresh! Bygones shall be bygones, and a new page turned for you to
write your lives in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard gave an anxious glance at Ada but said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have avoided saying one word to either of you or to Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``until now, in order that we might be open as the day,
and all on equal terms. I now affectionately advise, I now most
earnestly entreat, you two to part as you came here. Leave all else
to time, truth, and steadfastness. If you do otherwise, you will do
wrong, and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>A long silence succeeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada then, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) blue eyes tenderly to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``after what our cousin John has said, I think no choice is
left us. Your mind may be quite at ease about me, for you will leave
me here under his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) care and will be sure that I can have nothing to
wish for--quite sure if I guide myself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) advice. I--I don't
doubt, cousin Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, a little confused, <div class="bookquote">``that you are
very fond of me, and I--I don't think you will fall in love with
anybody else. But I should like you to consider well about it too, as
I should like you to be in all things very happy. You may trust in
me, cousin Richard. I am not at all changeable; but I am not
unreasonable, and should never blame you. Even cousins may be sorry
to part; and in truth I am very, very sorry, Richard, though I know
it's for your welfare. I shall always think of you affectionately,
and often talk of you with Esther, and--and perhaps you will
sometimes think a little of me, cousin Richard. So now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada,
going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) trembling hand, <div class="bookquote">``we are only
cousins again, Richard--for the time perhaps--and I pray for a
blessing on my dear cousin, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) goes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was strange to me that Richard should not be able to forgive my
guardian for entertaining the very same opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
himself had expressed of himself in much stronger terms to me. But it
was certainly the case. I observed with great regret that from this
hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) never was as free and open with Mr. Jarndyce as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had been
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had every reason given him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to be so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was not; and
solely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) side, an estrangement began to arise between them.

<p/>In the business of preparation and equipment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) soon lost himself,
and even his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) grief at parting from Ada, who remained in Hertfordshire
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), Mr. Jarndyce, and I went up to London for a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) by fits and starts, even with bursts of tears, and at
such times would confide to me the heaviest self-reproaches. But in a
few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would recklessly conjure up some undefinable means by
which they were both to be made rich and happy for ever, and would
become as gay as possible.

<p/>It was a busy time, and I trotted about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) all day long, buying
a variety of things of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) stood in need. Of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would
have bought if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had been left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) own ways I say nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was
perfectly confidential with me, and often talked so sensibly and
feelingly about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) faults and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) vigorous resolutions, and dwelt so
much upon the encouragement he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) derived from these conversations that
I could never have been tired if I had tried.

<p/>There used, in that week, to come backward and forward to our lodging
to fence with Richard a person who had formerly been a cavalry
soldier; he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was a fine bluff-looking man, of a frank free bearing,
with whom Richard had practised for some months. I heard so much
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), not only from Richard, but from my guardian too, that I
was purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, who happened to be
alone with me. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carstone will be here directly. Meanwhile, Miss
Summerson is very happy to see you, I know. Sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sat down, a little disconcerted by my presence, I thought, and
without looking at me, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) heavy sunburnt hand across and across
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) upper lip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are as punctual as the sun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Military time, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Force of habit. A mere habit in
me, sir. I am not at all business-like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Jarndyce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much of a one, sir. I keep a shooting gallery, but not much of a
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what kind of a shot and what kind of a swordsman do you make of
Mr. Carstone?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty good, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) replied, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) arms upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) broad chest
and looking very large. <div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Carstone was to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) full mind to
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) would come out very good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) don't, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) did at first, sir, but not afterwards. Not his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) full mind. Perhaps
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) has something else upon it--some young lady, perhaps.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) bright
dark eyes glanced at me for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) has not me upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) mind, I assure you, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I,
laughing, <div class="bookquote">``though you seem to suspect me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) reddened a little through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) brown and made me a trooper's bow.
<div class="bookquote">``No offence, I hope, miss. I am one of the roughs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I take it as a compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had not looked at me before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) looked at me now in three or
four quick successive glances. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said to
my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence, <div class="bookquote">``but you did me the
honour to mention the young lady's name--''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) repeated, and looked at me again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know the name?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss. To my knowledge I never heard it. I thought I had seen you
somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, raising my head from my work to look at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>); and there was something so genuine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) speech and manner that
I was glad of the opportunity. <div class="bookquote">``I remember faces very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) returned, meeting my look with the fullness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) dark eyes and broad forehead. <div class="bookquote">``Humph! What set me off, now, upon
that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) once more reddening through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) brown and being disconcerted by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you many pupils, Mr. George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They vary in their number, sir. Mostly they're but a small lot to
live by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All sorts, sir. Natives and foreigners. From gentlemen to
`prentices. I have had Frenchwomen come, before now, and show
themselves dabs at pistol-shooting. Mad people out of number, of
course, but THEY go everywhere where the doors stand open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People don't come with grudges and schemes of finishing their
practice with live targets, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much of that, sir, though that HAS happened. Mostly they come
for skill--or idleness. Six of one, and half-a-dozen of the other. I
beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, sitting stiffly upright and
squaring an elbow on each knee, <div class="bookquote">``but I believe you're a Chancery
suitor, if I have heard correct?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to say I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had one of YOUR compatriots in my time, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Chancery suitor?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``How was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the man was so badgered and worried and tortured by being
knocked about from post to pillar, and from pillar to post,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
George, ``that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got out of sorts. I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had any idea of
taking aim at anybody, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in that condition of resentment and
violence that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come and pay for fifty shots and fire away
till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was red hot. One day I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when there was nobody by
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been talking to me angrily about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrongs, ``If this
practice is a safety-valve, comrade, well and good; but I don't
altogether like your being so bent upon it in your present state of
mind; I'd rather you took to something else.<div class="bookquote">'' I was on my guard for a
blow, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was that passionate; but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) received it in very good part
and left off directly. We shook hands and struck up a sort of
friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that man?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>asked my guardian in a new tone of interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began by being a small Shropshire farmer before they made a
baited bull of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name Gridley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George directed another succession of quick bright glances at me
as my guardian and I exchanged a word or two of surprise at the
coincidence, and I therefore explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) how we knew the name.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made me another of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) soldierly bows in acknowledgment of what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
called my condescension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked at me, <div class="bookquote">``what it is that sets me
off again--but--bosh! What's my head running against!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) passed one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heavy hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) crisp dark hair as if to sweep the broken
thoughts out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind and sat a little forward, with one arm
akimbo and the other resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leg, looking in a brown study at
the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley
into new troubles and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) is in hiding,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I am told, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. George, still musing and looking on
the ground. <div class="bookquote">``So I am told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returned the trooper, lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes and coming out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reverie. <div class="bookquote">``I can't say anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) will be worn out
soon, I expect. You may file a strong man's heart away for a good
many years, but it will tell all of a sudden at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard's entrance stopped the conversation. Mr. George rose, made me
another of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) soldierly bows, wished my guardian a good day, and
strode heavily out of the room.

<p/>This was the morning of the day appointed for Richard's departure. We
had no more purchases to make now; I had completed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) packing
early in the afternoon; and our time was disengaged until night, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was to go to Liverpool for Holyhead. Jarndyce and Jarndyce being
again expected to come on that day, Richard proposed to me that we
should go down to the court and hear what passed. As it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) last
day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was eager to go, and I had never been there, I gave my
consent and we walked down to Westminster, where the court was then
sitting. We beguiled the way with arrangements concerning the letters
that Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and with a great many hopeful projects. My guardian knew where
we were going and therefore was not with us.

<p/>When we came to the court, there was the Lord Chancellor--the same
whom I had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) private room in Lincoln's Inn--sitting in
great state and gravity on the bench, with the mace and seals on a
red table below him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) and an immense flat nosegay, like a little
garden, which scented the whole court. Below the table, again, was a
long row of solicitors, with bundles of papers on the matting at
their feet; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and
gowns--some awake and some asleep, and one talking, and nobody paying
much attention to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) said. The Lord Chancellor leaned back in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) very easy chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) elbow on the cushioned arm and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
forehead resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) hand; some of those who were present dozed;
some read the newspapers; some walked about or whispered in groups:
all seemed perfectly at their ease, by no means in a hurry, very
unconcerned, and extremely comfortable.

<p/>To see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the roughness
of the suitors' lives and deaths; to see all that full dress and
ceremony and to think of the waste, and want, and beggared misery it
represented; to consider that while the sickness of hope deferred was
raging in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to
day, and year to year, in such good order and composure; to behold
the Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
looking at one another and at the spectators as if nobody had ever
heard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was
a bitter jest, was held in universal horror, contempt, and
indignation, was known for something so flagrant and bad that little
short of a miracle could bring any good out of it to any one--this
was so curious and self-contradictory to me, who had no experience of
it, that it was at first incredible, and I could not comprehend it. I
sat where Richard put me, and tried to listen, and looked about me;
but there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor
little Miss Flite, the madwoman, standing on a bench and nodding at
it.

<p/>Miss Flite soon espied us and came to where we sat. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gave me a
gracious welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) domain and indicated, with much gratification
and pride, its principal attractions. Mr. Kenge also came to speak to
us and did the honours of the place in much the same way, with the
bland modesty of a proprietor. It was not a very good day for a
visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) said; he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) would have preferred the first day of term; but it
was imposing, it was imposing.

<p/>When we had been there half an hour or so, the case in progress--if I
may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion--seemed to die out
of its own vapidity, without coming, or being by anybody expected to
come, to any result. The Lord Chancellor then threw down a bundle of
papers from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) desk to the gentlemen below him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>), and somebody said,
<div class="bookquote">``Jarndyce and Jarndyce.''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>Upon this there was a buzz, and a laugh, and
a general withdrawal of the bystanders, and a bringing in of great
heaps, and piles, and bags and bags full of papers.

<p/>I think it came on <div class="bookquote">``for further directions'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--about some bill of
costs, to the best of my understanding, which was confused enough.
But I counted twenty-three gentlemen in wigs who said they were <div class="bookquote">``in
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div>and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I.
They chatted about it with the Lord Chancellor, and contradicted and
explained among themselves, and some of them said it was this way,
and some of them said it was that way, and some of them jocosely
proposed to read huge volumes of affidavits, and there was more
buzzing and laughing, and everybody concerned was in a state of idle
entertainment, and nothing could be made of it by anybody. After an
hour or so of this, and a good many speeches being begun and cut
short, it was <div class="bookquote">``referred back for the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>as Mr. Kenge said, and
the papers were bundled up again before the clerks had finished
bringing them in.

<p/>I glanced at Richard on the termination of these hopeless proceedings
and was shocked to see the worn look of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) handsome young face. <div class="bookquote">``It
can't last for ever, Dame Durden. Better luck next time!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
said.

<p/>I had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and arranging them for Mr.
Kenge; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had seen me and made me a forlorn bow, which rendered
me desirous to get out of the court. Richard had given me his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arm and
was taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Mr. Carstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``and Miss
Summerson's also, but there's a lady here, a friend of mine, who
knows her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and wishes to have the pleasure of shaking hands.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
spoke, I saw before me, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) had started into bodily shape from
my remembrance, Mrs. Rachael of my godmother's house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Esther?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you recollect me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) my hand and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) yes and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was very little
altered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you remember those times, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) returned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)
old asperity. <div class="bookquote">``They are changed now. Well! I am glad to see you, and
glad you are not too proud to know me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) seemed
disappointed that I was not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Proud, Mrs. Rachael!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am married, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) returned, coldly correcting me, <div class="bookquote">``and am
Mrs. Chadband. Well! I wish you good day, and I hope you'll do well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy, who had been attentive to this short dialogue, heaved a
sigh in my ear and elbowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) own and Mrs. Rachael's way through the
confused little crowd of people coming in and going out, which we
were in the midst of and which the change in the business had brought
together. Richard and I were making our way through it, and I was yet
in the first chill of the late unexpected recognition when I saw,
coming towards us, but not seeing us, no less a person than Mr.
George. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made nothing of the people about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tramped on,
staring over their heads into the body of the court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard as I called his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are well met, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``And you, miss. Could you point
a person out for me, I want? I don't understand these places.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Turning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) spoke and making an easy way for us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) stopped when we
were out of the press in a corner behind a great red curtain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a little cracked old woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I put up my finger, for Miss Flite was close by me, having kept
beside me all the time and having called the attention of several of
her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) legal acquaintance to me -LRB-as I had overheard to my confusion-RRB- by
whispering in their ears, <div class="bookquote">``Hush! Fitz Jarndyce on my left!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``You remember, miss, that we passed some
conversation on a certain man this morning? Gridley,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a low
whisper behind his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) is hiding at my place. I couldn't mention it. Hadn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>)
authority. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) last march, miss, and has a whim to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) says they can feel for one another, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been almost as
good as a friend to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) here. I came down to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for when I
sat by Gridley this afternoon, I seemed to hear the roll of the
muffled drums.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you be so good?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) returned with a glance of something like
apprehension at Miss Flite. <div class="bookquote">``It's a providence I met you, miss; I
doubt if I should have known how to get on with that lady.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
put one hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breast and stood upright in a martial attitude as
I informed little Miss Flite, in her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ear, of the purport of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) kind
errand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My angry friend from Shropshire! Almost as celebrated as myself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Now really! My dear, I will wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with the
greatest pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is living concealed at Mr. George's,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Hush! This is Mr.
George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In--deed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Flite. <div class="bookquote">``Very proud to have the honour! A
military man, my dear. You know, a perfect general!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whispered to
me.

<p/>Poor Miss Flite deemed it necessary to be so courtly and polite, as a
mark of her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) respect for the army, and to curtsy so very often that it
was no easy matter to get her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) out of the court. When this was at last
done, and addressing Mr. George as <div class="bookquote">``General,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm,
to the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
so discomposed and begged me so respectfully <div class="bookquote">``not to desert him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>that
I could not make up my mind to do it, especially as Miss Flite was
always tractable with me and as she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) too said, <div class="bookquote">``Fitz Jarndyce, my
dear, you will accompany us, of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As Richard seemed quite
willing, and even anxious, that we should see them safely to their
destination, we agreed to do so. And as Mr. George informed us that
Gridley's mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after
hearing of their interview in the morning, I wrote a hasty note in
pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why. Mr. George
sealed it at a coffee-house, that it might lead to no discovery, and
we sent it off by a ticket-porter.

<p/>We then took a hackney-coach and drove away to the neighbourhood of
Leicester Square. We walked through some narrow courts, for which Mr.
George apologized, and soon came to the shooting gallery, the door of
which was closed. As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pulled a bell-handle which hung by a chain to
the door-post, a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair,
wearing spectacles, and dressed in a black spencer and gaiters and a
broad-brimmed hat, and carrying a large gold-beaded cane, addressed
him (<font color='blue'><b>spencer</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon, my good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>spencer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but is this George's
Shooting Gallery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. George, glancing up at the great letters
in which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! To be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, following his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Thank
you. Have you rung the bell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is George, sir, and I have rung the bell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Your name is George? Then I am
here as soon as you, you see. You came for me, no doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. You have the advantage of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Then it was your young man who
came for me. I am a physician and was requested--five minutes ago--to
come and visit a sick man at George's Shooting Gallery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The muffled drums,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, turning to Richard and me and
gravely shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It's quite correct, sir. Will you please
to walk in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>The door being at that moment opened by a very singular-looking
little man in a green-baize cap and apron, whose face and hands and
dress were blackened all over, we passed along a dreary passage into
a large building with bare brick walls where there were targets, and
guns, and swords, and other things of that kind. When we had all
arrived here, the physician stopped, and taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) hat, appeared
to vanish by magic and to leave another and quite a different man in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now lookee here, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, turning quickly round upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and tapping him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the breast with a large forefinger. <div class="bookquote">``You know
me, and I know you. You're a man of the world, and I'm a man of the
world. My name's Bucket, as you are aware, and I have got a
peace-warrant against Gridley. You have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) out of the way a
long time, and you have been artful in it, and it does you credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George, looking hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), bit his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lip and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the other, keeping close to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), ``you're a
sensible man and a well-conducted man; that's what YOU are, beyond a
doubt. And mind you, I don't talk to you as a common character,
because you have served your country and you know that when duty
calls we must obey. Consequently you're very far from wanting to give
trouble. If I required assistance, you'd assist me; that's what YOU``D
do. Phil Squod, don't you go a-sidling round the gallery like
that''--the dirty little man was shuffling about with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder
against the wall, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes on the intruder, in a manner that
looked threatening--<div class="bookquote">``because I know you and won't have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, guv`ner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The little man, with a low growl, stood still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ladies and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``you'll excuse anything that
may appear to be disagreeable in this, for my name's Inspector Bucket
of the Detective, and I have a duty to perform. George, I know where
my man is because I was on the roof last night and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through
the skylight, and you along with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in there, you know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>pointing; <div class="bookquote">``that's where HE (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is--on a sofy. Now I must see my man, and
I must tell my man to consider himself in custody; but you know me,
and you know I don't want to take any uncomfortable measures. You
give me your word, as from one man to another -LRB-and an old soldier,
mind you, likewise-RRB-, that it's honourable between us two, and I'll
accommodate you to the utmost of my power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply. <div class="bookquote">``But it wasn't handsome in you, Mr.
Bucket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gammon, George! Not handsome?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, tapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
broad breast again and shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't say it wasn't
handsome in you to keep my man so close, do I? Be equally
good-tempered to me, old boy! Old William Tell, Old Shaw, the Life
Guardsman! Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guardsman</b></font>)'s a model of the whole British army in himself,
ladies and gentlemen. I'd give a fifty-pun' note to be such a figure
of a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>The affair being brought to this head, Mr. George, after a little
consideration, proposed to go in first to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comrade -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) called
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)-RRB-, taking Miss Flite with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Mr. Bucket agreeing, they went away
to the further end of the gallery, leaving us sitting and standing by
a table covered with guns. Mr. Bucket took this opportunity of
entering into a little light conversation, asking me if I were afraid
of fire-arms, as most young ladies were; asking Richard if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) were a
good shot; asking Phil Squod which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) considered the best of those
rifles and what it might be worth first-hand, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) in return
that it was a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) ever gave way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) temper, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) was
naturally so amiable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) might have been a young woman, and
making himself generally agreeable.

<p/>After a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) followed us to the further end of the gallery, and
Richard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said that if we had no objection to see his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comrade, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would take
a visit from us very kindly. The words had hardly passed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips
when the bell was rung and my guardian appeared, <div class="bookquote">``on the chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
slightly observed, <div class="bookquote">``of being able to do any little thing for a poor
fellow involved in the same misfortune as himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We all four went
back together and went into the place where Gridley was.

<p/>It was a bare room, partitioned off from the gallery with unpainted
wood. As the screening was not more than eight or ten feet high and
only enclosed the sides, not the top, the rafters of the high gallery
roof were overhead, and the skylight through which Mr. Bucket had
looked down. The sun was low--near setting--and its light came redly
in above, without descending to the ground. Upon a plain
canvas-covered sofa lay the man from Shropshire, dressed much as we
had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last, but so changed that at first I recognized no
likeness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) colourless face to what I recollected.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been still writing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hiding-place, and still dwelling on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grievances, hour after hour. A table and some shelves were
covered with manuscript papers and with worn pens and a medley of
such tokens. Touchingly and awfully drawn together, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the little
mad woman were side by side and, as it were, alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat on a
chair holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and none of us went close to them.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice had faded, with the old expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
strength, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resistance to the wrongs that had
at last subdued him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The faintest shadow of an object full of form
and colour is such a picture of it as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was of the man from
Shropshire whom we had spoken with before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head to Richard and me and spoke to my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce, it is very kind of you to come to see me. I am not
long to be seen, I think. I am very glad to take your hand, sir. You
are a good man, superior to injustice, and God knows I honour you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook hands earnestly, and my guardian said some words of
comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may seem strange to you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gridley/Mr. Gridley</b></font>)</div>returned Gridley; <div class="bookquote">``I should not
have liked to see you if this had been the first time of our meeting.
But you know I made a fight for it, you know I stood up with my
single hand against them all, you know I told them the truth to the
last, and told them what they were, and what they had done to me; so
I don't mind your seeing me, this wreck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gridley/Mr. Gridley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been courageous with them many and many a time,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned
my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a faint smile. <div class="bookquote">``I told you what would come
of it when I ceased to be so, and see here! Look at us--look at us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) drew the hand Miss Flite held through her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) arm and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
something nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This ends it. Of all my old associations, of all my old pursuits and
hopes, of all the living and the dead world, this one poor soul alone
comes natural to me, and I am fit for. There is a tie of many
suffering years between us two, and it is the only tie I ever had on
earth that Chancery has not broken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Accept my blessing, Gridley,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite in tears. <div class="bookquote">``Accept my
blessing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, boastfully, that they never could break my heart, Mr.
Jarndyce. I was resolved that they should not. I did believe that I
could, and would, charge them with being the mockery they were until
I died of some bodily disorder. But I am worn out. How long I have
been wearing out, I don't know; I seemed to break down in an hour. I
hope they may never come to hear of it. I hope everybody here will
lead them to believe that I died defying them, consistently and
perseveringly, as I did through so many years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Bucket, who was sitting in a corner by the door,
good-naturedly offered such consolation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) could administer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) said from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) corner. <div class="bookquote">``Don't go on in that way, Mr.
Gridley. You are only a little low. We are all of us a little low
sometimes. I am. Hold up, hold up! You'll lose your temper with the
whole round of 'em, again and again; and I shall take you on a score
of warrants yet, if I have luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't shake your head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Nod it; that's what I want
to see you do. Why, Lord bless your soul, what times we have had
together! Haven't I seen you in the Fleet over and over again for
contempt? Haven't I come into court, twenty afternoons for no other
purpose than to see you pin the Chancellor like a bull-dog? Don't you
remember when you first began to threaten the lawyers, and the peace
was sworn against you two or three times a week? Ask the little old
lady there; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has been always present. Hold up, Mr. Gridley, hold
up, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>asked George in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bucket in the same tone. Then resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
encouragement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pursued aloud: <div class="bookquote">``Worn out, Mr. Gridley? After
dodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here
like a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor? That ain't like
being worn out. I should think not! Now I tell you what you want. You
want excitement, you know, to keep YOU up; that's what YOU want.
You're used to it, and you can't do without it. I couldn't myself.
Very well, then; here's this warrant got by Mr. Tulkinghorn of
Lincoln's Inn Fields, and backed into half-a-dozen counties since.
What do you say to coming along with me, upon this warrant, and
having a good angry argument before the magistrates? It'll do you
good; it'll freshen you up and get you into training for another turn
at the Chancellor. Give in? Why, I am surprised to hear a man of your
energy talk of giving in. You mustn't do that. You're half the fun of
the fair in the Court of Chancery. George, you lend Mr. Gridley a
hand, and let's see now whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) won't be better up than down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) is very weak,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>said the trooper in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Bucket anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``I only want to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>). I
don't like to see an old acquaintance giving in like this. It would
cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) up more than anything if I could make him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) a little waxy
with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)'s welcome to drop into me, right and left, if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) likes. I
shall never take advantage of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a scream</b></font>)</div><p/>The roof rang with a scream from Miss Flite, which still rings in my
ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, Gridley!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) cried as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fell heavily and calmly back from
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Not without my blessing. After so many years!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sun was down, the light had gradually stolen from the roof, and
the shadow had crept upward. But to me the shadow of that pair, one
living and one dead, fell heavier on Richard's departure than the
darkness of the darkest night. And through Richard's farewell words I
heard it echoed: <div class="bookquote">``Of all my old associations, of all my old pursuits
and hopes, of all the living and the dead world, this one poor soul
alone comes natural to me, and I am fit for. There is a tie of many
suffering years between us two, and it is the only tie I ever had on
earth that Chancery has not broken!''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXV

<p/>Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All


<p/>There is disquietude in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street. Black
suspicion hides in that peaceful region. The mass of Cook's Courtiers
are in their usual state of mind, no better and no worse; but Mr.
Snagsby is changed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) little woman knows it.

<p/>For Tom-all-Alone's and Lincoln's Inn Fields persist in harnessing
themselves, a pair of ungovernable coursers, to the chariot of Mr.
Snagsby's imagination; and Mr. Bucket drives; and the passengers are
Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn; and the complete equipage whirls though the
law-stationery business at wild speed all round the clock. Even in
the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken, it rattles
away at a smoking pace from the dinner-table, when Mr. Snagsby pauses
in carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes
and stares at the kitchen wall.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby cannot make out what it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has had to do with.
Something is wrong somewhere, but what something, what may come of
it, to whom, when, and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter
is the puzzle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) remote impressions of the robes and
coronets, the stars and garters, that sparkle through the
surface-dust of Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) veneration for the
mysteries presided over by that best and closest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) customers,
whom all the Inns of Court, all Chancery Lane, and all the legal
neighbourhood agree to hold in awe; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) remembrance of Detective Mr.
Bucket with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) forefinger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) confidential manner, impossible to
be evaded or declined, persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) is a party to some
dangerous secret without knowing what it is. And it is the fearful
peculiarity of this condition that, at any hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) daily life, at
any opening of the shop-door, at any pull of the bell, at any
entrance of a messenger, or any delivery of a letter, the secret may
take air and fire, explode, and blow up--Mr. Bucket only knows whom.

<p/>For which reason, whenever a man unknown comes into the shop -LRB-as many
men unknown do-RRB- and says, <div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Snagsby in?''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>or words to that
innocent effect, Mr. Snagsby's heart knocks hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) guilty
breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) undergoes so much from such inquiries that when they are
made by boys he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) revenges himself by flipping at their ears over the
counter and asking the young dogs what they mean by it and why they
can't speak out at once? More impracticable men and boys persist in
walking into Mr. Snagsby's sleep and terrifying him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) with
unaccountable questions, so that often when the cock at the little
dairy in Cursitor Street breaks out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) usual absurd way about the
morning, Mr. Snagsby finds himself in a crisis of nightmare, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
little woman shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) and saying <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with the man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The little woman herself is not the least item in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) difficulty. To
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is always keeping a secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has under
all circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double tooth,
which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sharpness is ever ready to twist out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head, gives Mr.
Snagsby, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dentistical presence, much of the air of a dog who
has a reservation from his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) master and will look anywhere rather than
meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eye.

<p/>These various signs and tokens, marked by the little woman, are not
lost upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). They impel her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to say, <div class="bookquote">``Snagsby has something on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And thus suspicion gets into Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.
From suspicion to jealousy, Mrs. Snagsby finds the road as natural
and short as from Cook's Court to Chancery Lane. And thus jealousy
gets into Cook's Court, Cursitor Street. Once there -LRB-and it was
always lurking thereabout-RRB-, it is very active and nimble in Mrs.
Snagsby's breast, prompting her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) to nocturnal examinations of Mr.
Snagsby's pockets; to secret perusals of Mr. Snagsby's letters; to
private researches in the day book and ledger, till, cash-box, and
iron safe; to watchings at windows, listenings behind doors, and a
general putting of this and that together by the wrong end.

<p/>Mrs. Snagsby is so perpetually on the alert that the house becomes
ghostly with creaking boards and rustling garments. The `prentices
think somebody may have been murdered there in bygone times. Guster
holds certain loose atoms of an idea -LRB-picked up at Tooting, where
they were found floating among the orphans-RRB- that there is buried
money underneath the cellar, guarded by an old man with a white
beard, who cannot get out for seven thousand years because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said
the Lord's Prayer backwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was Nimrod?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of herself. <div class="bookquote">``Who
was that lady--that creature? And who is that boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Nimrod</b></font>)</div>Now, Nimrod being
as dead as the mighty hunter whose name Mrs. Snagsby has
appropriated, and the lady being unproducible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) directs her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mental
eye, for the present, with redoubled vigilance to the boy. <div class="bookquote">``And who,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>quoth Mrs. Snagsby for the thousand and first time, <div class="bookquote">``is that boy? Who
is that--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>And there Mrs. Snagsby is seized with an inspiration.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has no respect for Mr. Chadband. No, to be sure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) wouldn't
have, of course. Naturally he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) wouldn't, under those contagious
circumstances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) was invited and appointed by Mr. Chadband--why,
Mrs. Snagsby heard it herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) own ears!--to come back, and
be told where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) was to go, to be addressed by Mr. Chadband; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
never came! Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) never come? Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) was told not to come.
Who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) not to come? Who? Ha, ha! Mrs. Snagsby sees it all.

<p/>But happily -LRB-and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head and tightly
smiles-RRB- that boy was met by Mr. Chadband yesterday in the streets;
and that boy, as affording a subject which Mr. Chadband desires to
improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation, was
seized by Mr. Chadband and threatened with being delivered over to
the police unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) showed the reverend gentleman where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) lived and
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) entered into, and fulfilled, an undertaking to appear in
Cook's Court to-morrow night, <div class="bookquote">``to--mor--row--night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cook</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Snagsby
repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight
shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head; and to-morrow night that boy will be here, and
to-morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and upon some
one else; and oh, you may walk a long while in your secret ways -LRB-says
Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn-RRB-, but you can't blind ME!

<p/>Mrs. Snagsby sounds no timbrel in anybody's ears, but holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
purpose quietly, and keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) counsel. To-morrow comes, the savoury
preparations for the Oil Trade come, the evening comes. Comes Mr.
Snagsby in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) black coat; come the Chadbands; come -LRB-when the gorging
vessel is replete-RRB- the `prentices and Guster, to be edified; comes at
last, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) slouching head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) shuffle backward, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
shuffle forward, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) shuffle to the right, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) shuffle to the
left, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) bit of fur cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) muddy hand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) picks as if
it were some mangy bird he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) had caught and was plucking before eating
raw, Jo, the very, very tough subject Mr. Chadband is to improve.

<p/>Mrs. Snagsby screws a watchful glance on Jo as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) is brought into the
little drawing-room by Guster. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
comes in. Aha! Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) look at Mr. Snagsby? Mr. Snagsby looks at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>). Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) do that, but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all? Why
else should that look pass between them, why else should Mr. Snagsby
be confused and cough a signal cough behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand? It is as clear
as crystal that Mr. Snagsby is that boy's father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peace, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>reverend</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, rising and wiping the oily
exudations from his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) reverend visage. <div class="bookquote">``Peace be with us! My friends,
why with us? Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) fat smile, <div class="bookquote">``it cannot be against us,
because it must be for us; because it is not hardening, because it is
softening; because it does not make war like the hawk, but comes home
unto us like the dove. Therefore, my friends, peace be with us! My
human boy, come forward!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>Stretching forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) flabby paw, Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo's
arm and considers where to station him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>). Jo, very doubtful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
reverend friend's intentions and not at all clear but that something
practical and painful is going to be done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>), mutters, <div class="bookquote">``You let
me alone. I never said nothink to you. You let me alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Chadband smoothly, <div class="bookquote">``I will not let you
alone. And why? Because I am a harvest-labourer, because I am a
toiler and a moiler, because you are delivered over unto me and are
become as a precious instrument in my hands. My friends, may I so
employ this instrument as to use it to your advantage, to your
profit, to your gain, to your welfare, to your enrichment! My young
friend, sit upon this stool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo, apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman
wants to cut his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hair, shields his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head with both arms and is got
into the required position with great difficulty and every possible
manifestation of reluctance.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is at last adjusted like a lay-figure, Mr. Chadband, retiring
behind the table, holds up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) bear's-paw and says, <div class="bookquote">``My friends!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>This is the signal for a general settlement of the audience. The
`prentices giggle internally and nudge each other. Guster falls into
a staring and vacant state, compounded of a stunned admiration of Mr.
Chadband and pity for the friendless outcast whose condition touches
her (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) nearly. Mrs. Snagsby silently lays trains of gunpowder. Mrs.
Chadband composes herself grimly by the fire and warms her (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) knees,
finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence.

<p/>It happens that Mr. Chadband has a pulpit habit of fixing some member
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) congregation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) eye and fatly arguing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) points with
that particular person, who is understood to be expected to be moved
to an occasional grunt, groan, gasp, or other audible expression of
inward working, which expression of inward working, being echoed by
some elderly lady in the next pew and so communicated like a game of
forfeits through a circle of the more fermentable sinners present,
serves the purpose of parliamentary cheering and gets Mr. Chadband's
steam up. From mere force of habit, Mr. Chadband in saying <div class="bookquote">``My
friends!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>has rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) eye on Mr. Snagsby and proceeds to make that
ill-starred stationer, already sufficiently confused, the immediate
recipient of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) discourse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have here among us, my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``a Gentile and a
heathen, a dweller in the tents of Tom-all-Alone's and a mover-on
upon the surface of the earth. We have here among us, my friends,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Chadband, untwisting the point with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) dirty thumb-nail,
bestows an oily smile on Mr. Snagsby, signifying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) will throw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) an argumentative back-fall presently if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) be not already down,
<div class="bookquote">``a brother and a boy. Devoid of parents, devoid of relations, devoid
of flocks and herds, devoid of gold and silver and of precious
stones. Now, my friends, why do I say he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is devoid of these
possessions? Why? Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Chadband states the question as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) were propounding an entirely new riddle of much ingenuity and
merit to Mr. Snagsby and entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) not to give it up.

<p/>Mr. Snagsby, greatly perplexed by the mysterious look he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) received
just now from his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) little woman--at about the period when Mr. Chadband
mentioned the word parents--is tempted into modestly remarking, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know, I'm sure, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>the word parents</b></font>)</div>On which interruption Mrs. Chadband
glares and Mrs. Snagsby says, <div class="bookquote">``For shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear a voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Chadband; <div class="bookquote">``is it a still small voice, my
friends? I fear not, though I fain would hope so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--h!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>from Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/>``Which says, ``I don't know.<div class="bookquote">'' Then I will tell you why. I say this
brother present here among us is devoid of parents, devoid of
relations, devoid of flocks and herds, devoid of gold, of silver, and
of precious stones because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is devoid of the light that shines in
upon some of us. What is that light? What is it? I ask you, what is
that light?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Chadband draws back his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) head and pauses, but Mr. Snagsby is not
to be lured on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) destruction again. Mr. Chadband, leaning
forward over the table, pierces what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) has got to follow directly
into Mr. Snagsby with the thumb-nail already mentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, <div class="bookquote">``the ray of rays, the sun of suns, the moon
of moons, the star of stars. It is the light of Terewth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Chadband draws himself up again and looks triumphantly at Mr.
Snagsby as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) would be glad to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) feels after that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Terewth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Chadband, hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``Say not to me
that it is NOT the lamp of lamps. I say to you it is. I say to you, a
million of times over, it is. It is! I say to you that I will
proclaim it to you, whether you like it or not; nay, that the less
you like it, the more I will proclaim it to you. With a
speaking-trumpet! I say to you that if you rear yourself against it,
you shall fall, you shall be bruised, you shall be battered, you
shall be flawed, you shall be smashed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>The present effect of this flight of oratory--much admired for its
general power by Mr. Chadband's followers--being not only to make Mr.
Chadband unpleasantly warm, but to represent the innocent Mr. Snagsby
in the light of a determined enemy to virtue, with a forehead of
brass and a heart of adamant, that unfortunate tradesman becomes yet
more disconcerted and is in a very advanced state of low spirits and
false position when Mr. Chadband accidentally finishes him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) resumes after dabbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) fat head for some
time--and it smokes to such an extent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) seems to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief at it, which smokes, too, after every dab--<div class="bookquote">``to
pursue the subject we are endeavouring with our lowly gifts to

`prentices and Guster, to their consternation, <div class="bookquote">``if I am told by the

friends, what is this Terewth then? Firstly -LRB-in a spirit of love-RRB-,
what is the common sort of Terewth--the working clothes--the

 (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--h!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>from Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it suppression?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>A shiver in the negative from Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it reservation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>A shake of the head from Mrs. Snagsby--very long and very tight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my friends, it is neither of these. Neither of these names

have to wrestle, and to combat and to struggle, and to conquer, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sake--when this young hardened heathen told us a story of a cock,
and of a bull, and of a lady, and of a sovereign, was THAT the
Terewth? No. Or if it was partly, was it wholly and entirely? No, my
friends, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>If Mr. Snagsby could withstand his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) little woman's look as it enters
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eyes, the windows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) soul, and searches the whole
tenement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) were other than the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cowers and droops.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or, my juvenile friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>meek</b></font>)</div>says Chadband, descending to the level of
their comprehension with a very obtrusive demonstration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
greasily meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose,
``if the master of this house was to go forth into the city and there
see an eel, and was to come back, and was to call unto him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) the
mistress of this house, and was to say, ``Sarah, rejoice with me, for
I have seen an elephant!<div class="bookquote">'' would THAT be Terewth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby in tears.

<p/>``Or put it, my juvenile friends, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) saw an elephant, and
returning said ``Lo, the city is barren, I have seen but an eel,<div class="bookquote">''
would THAT be Terewth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby sobbing loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or put it, my juvenile friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>said Chadband, stimulated by the
sound, <div class="bookquote">``that the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for
parents he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the
young gazelles, and the serpents, went back to their dwellings and
had their pipes, and their pots, and their flutings and their
dancings, and their malt liquors, and their butcher's meat and
poultry, would THAT be Terewth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby replies by delivering herself a prey to spasms, not an
unresisting prey, but a crying and a tearing one, so that Cook's
Court re-echoes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) shrieks. Finally, becoming cataleptic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano. After
unspeakable suffering, productive of the utmost consternation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is
pronounced, by expresses from the bedroom, free from pain, though
much exhausted, in which state of affairs Mr. Snagsby, trampled and
crushed in the piano-forte removal, and extremely timid and feeble,
ventures to come out from behind the door in the drawing-room.

<p/>All this time Jo has been standing on the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) woke up, ever
picking his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cap and putting bits of fur in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) spits them
out with a remorseful air, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) feels that it is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) nature to
be an unimprovable reprobate and that it's no good HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) trying to keep
awake, for HE (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) won't never know nothink. Though it may be, Jo, that
there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near
the brutes as thine, recording deeds done on this earth for common
men, that if the Chadbands, removing their own persons from the
light, would but show it thee in simple reverence, would but leave it
unimproved, would but regard it as being eloquent enough without
their modest aid--it might hold thee awake, and thou might learn from
it yet!

<p/>Jo never heard of any such book. Its compilers and the Reverend
Chadband are all one to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>), except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) knows the Reverend
Chadband and would rather run away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) for an hour than hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>)
talk for five minutes. <div class="bookquote">``It an't no good my waiting here no longer,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>thinks Jo. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Snagsby an't a-going to say nothink to me to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And downstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) shuffles.

<p/>But downstairs is the charitable Guster, holding by the handrail of
the kitchen stairs and warding off a fit, as yet doubtfully, the same
having been induced by Mrs. Snagsby's screaming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) own
supper of bread and cheese to hand to Jo, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ventures to
interchange a word or so for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's something to eat, poor boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div>says Guster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank`ee, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you hungry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jist!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo stops in the middle of a bite and looks petrified. For this orphan
charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting has patted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) on the shoulder, and it is the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) life that any
decent hand has been so laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never know'd nothink about 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more didn't I of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guster</b></font>)</div>cries Guster. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is repressing symptoms
favourable to the fit when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seems to take alarm at something and
vanishes down the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the
step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am, Mr. Snagsby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you were gone--there's another half-crown, Jo. It was
quite right of you to say nothing about the lady the other night when
we were out together. It would breed trouble. You can't be too quiet,
Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am fly, master!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so, good night.

<p/>A ghostly shade, frilled and night-capped, follows the law-stationer
to the room he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came from and glides higher up. And henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
begins, go where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will, to be attended by another shadow than his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
own, hardly less constant than his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own, hardly less quiet than his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
own. And into whatsoever atmosphere of secrecy his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own shadow may
pass, let all concerned in the secrecy beware! For the watchful Mrs.
Snagsby is there too--bone of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bone, flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flesh, shadow of
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shadow.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI

<p/>Sharpshooters


<p/>Wintry morning, looking with dull eyes and sallow face upon the
neighbourhood of Leicester Square, finds its inhabitants unwilling to
get out of bed. Many of them are not early risers at the brightest of
times, being birds of night who roost when the sun is high and are
wide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out. Behind dingy
blind and curtain, in upper story and garret, skulking more or less
under false names, false hair, false titles, false jewellery, and
false histories, a colony of brigands lie in their first sleep.
Gentlemen of the green-baize road who could discourse from personal
experience of foreign galleys and home treadmills; spies of strong
governments that eternally quake with weakness and miserable fear,
broken traitors, cowards, bullies, gamesters, shufflers, swindlers,
and false witnesses; some not unmarked by the branding-iron beneath
their dirty braid; all with more cruelty in them than was in Nero,
and more crime than is in Newgate. For howsoever bad the devil can be
in fustian or smock-frock -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) can be very bad in both-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is a
more designing, callous, and intolerable devil when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sticks a pin
in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shirt-front, calls himself a gentleman, backs a card or
colour, plays a game or so of billiards, and knows a little about
bills and promissory notes than in any other form he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wears. And in
such form Mr. Bucket shall find him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will, still pervading
the tributary channels of Leicester Square.

<p/>But the wintry morning wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) not and wakes him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) not. It wakes Mr.
George of the shooting gallery and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) familiar. They arise, roll up
and stow away their mattresses. Mr. George, having shaved himself
before a looking-glass of minute proportions, then marches out,
bare-headed and bare-chested, to the pump in the little yard and anon
comes back shining with yellow soap, friction, drifting rain, and
exceedingly cold water. As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rubs himself upon a large jack-towel,
blowing like a military sort of diver just come up, his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) hair curling
tighter and tighter on his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) sunburnt temples the more he (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) rubs it so
that it looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive
instrument than an iron rake or a curry-comb--as he (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) rubs, and puffs,
and polishes, and blows, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) head from side to side the more
conveniently to excoriate his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) throat, and standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) body well
bent forward to keep the wet from his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) martial legs, Phil, on his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>)
knees lighting a fire, looks round as if it were enough washing for
him (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) to see all that done, and sufficient renovation for one day to
take in the superfluous health his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) master throws off.

<p/>When Mr. George is dry, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) goes to work to brush his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head with two
hard brushes at once, to that unmerciful degree that Phil,
shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) way round the gallery in the act of sweeping it,
winks with sympathy. This chafing over, the ornamental part of Mr.
George's toilet is soon performed. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fills his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe, lights it, and
marches up and down smoking, as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) custom is, while Phil, raising a
powerful odour of hot rolls and coffee, prepares breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) smokes
gravely and marches in slow time. Perhaps this morning's pipe is
devoted to the memory of Gridley in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so, Phil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says George of the shooting gallery after several
turns in silence, <div class="bookquote">``you were dreaming of the country last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil, by the by, said as much in a tone of surprise as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) scrambled
out of bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, guv`ner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know what it was like, guv`ner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>said Phil, considering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you know it was the country?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On account of the grass, I think. And the swans upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil
after further consideration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What were the swans doing on the grass?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They was a-eating of it, I expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil.

<p/>The master resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) march, and the man resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) preparation of
breakfast. It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation, being
limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for
two and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty
grate; but as Phil has to sidle round a considerable part of the
gallery for every object he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) wants, and never brings two objects at
once, it takes time under the circumstances. At length the breakfast
is ready. Phil announcing it, Mr. George knocks the ashes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
pipe on the hob, stands his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) pipe itself in the chimney corner, and
sits down to the meal. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) has helped himself, Phil follows suit,
sitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
plate on his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) knees. Either in humility, or to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) blackened
hands, or because it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) natural manner of eating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, plying his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knife and fork; <div class="bookquote">``why, I
suppose you never clapped your eyes on the country, Phil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see the marshes once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil, contentedly eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What marshes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``THE marshes, commander,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>returns Phil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know where they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil; <div class="bookquote">``but I see 'em, guv`ner.
They was flat. And miste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Governor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil,
expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody
but Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was born in the country, Phil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was you indeed, commander?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And bred there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil elevates his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) one eyebrow, and after respectfully staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
master to express interest, swallows a great gulp of coffee, still
staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not a bird's note that I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``Not
many an English leaf or berry that I couldn't name. Not many a tree
that I couldn't climb yet if I was put to it. I was a real country
boy, once. My good mother lived in the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must have been a fine old lady, guv`ner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>Phil observes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! And not so old either, five and thirty years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
George. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll wager that at ninety she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be near as upright
as me, and near as broad across the shoulders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) die at ninety, guv`ner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>inquires Phil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Bosh! Let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rest in peace, God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the
trooper. <div class="bookquote">``What set me on about country boys, and runaways, and
good-for-nothings? You, to be sure! So you never clapped your eyes
upon the country--marshes and dreams excepted. Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N-no, I don't know as I do, particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The town's enough for you, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, commander,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil, <div class="bookquote">``I ain't acquainted with
anythink else, and I doubt if I ain't a-getting too old to take to
novelties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old ARE you, Phil?''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>asks the trooper, pausing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) conveys his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
smoking saucer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm something with a eight in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil. <div class="bookquote">``It can't be eighty.
Nor yet eighteen. It's betwixt 'em, somewheres.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George, slowly putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) saucer without tasting its
contents, is laughingly beginning, <div class="bookquote">``Why, what the deuce, Phil--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) stops, seeing that Phil is counting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) dirty fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just eight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil, ``agreeable to the parish calculation,
when I went with the tinker. I was sent on a errand, and I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
a-sittin under a old buildin with a fire all to himself wery
comfortable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) says, ``Would you like to come along a me, my
man?'' I says ``Yes,'' and him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) and me and the fire goes home to
Clerkenwell together. That was April Fool Day. I was able to count up
to ten; and when April Fool Day come round again, I says to myself,
``Now, old chap, you're one and a eight in it.'' April Fool Day after
that, I says, ``Now, old chap, you're two and a eight in it.<div class="bookquote">'' In
course of time, I come to ten and a eight in it; two tens and a eight
in it. When it got so high, it got the upper hand of me, but this is
how I always know there's a eight in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>chap</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``And where's the
tinker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink put him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) in the hospital, guv`ner, and the hospital put him (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>)--in
a glass-case, I HAVE heerd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>Phil replies mysteriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By that means you got promotion? Took the business, Phil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, commander, I took the business. Such as it was. It wasn't much
of a beat--round Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Clerkenwell, Smiffeld,
and there--poor neighbourhood, where they uses up the kettles till
they're past mending. Most of the tramping tinkers used to come and
lodge at our place; that was the best part of my master's earnings.
But they didn't come to me. I warn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could sing 'em a
good song. I couldn't! He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could play 'em a tune on any sort of pot
you please, so as it was iron or block tin. I never could do nothing
with a pot but mend it or bile it--never had a note of music in me.
Besides, I was too ill-looking, and their wives complained of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were mighty particular. You would pass muster in a crowd,
Phil!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper with a pleasant smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, guv`ner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>returns Phil, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, I shouldn't. I
was passable enough when I went with the tinker, though nothing to
boast of then; but what with blowing the fire with my mouth when I
was young, and spileing my complexion, and singeing my hair off, and
swallering the smoke, and what with being nat`rally unfort`nate in
the way of running against hot metal and marking myself by sich
means, and what with having turn-ups with the tinker as I got older,
almost whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>) was too far gone in drink--which was almost
always--my beauty was queer, wery queer, even at that time. As to
since, what with a dozen years in a dark forge where the men was
given to larking, and what with being scorched in a accident at a
gas-works, and what with being blowed out of winder case-filling at
the firework business, I am ugly enough to be made a show on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Resigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied
manner, Phil begs the favour of another cup of coffee. While drinking
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``It was after the case-filling blow-up when I first see
you, commander. You remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember, Phil. You were walking along in the sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Crawling, guv`ner, again a wall--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, Phil--shouldering your way on--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a night-cap!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>exclaims Phil, excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a night-cap--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And hobbling with a couple of sticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>cries Phil, still more
excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With a couple of sticks. When--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you stops, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>cries Phil, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) cup and
saucer and hastily removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) plate from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) knees, ``and says to
me, ``What, comrade! You have been in the wars!'' I didn't say much to
you, commander, then, for I was took by surprise that a person so
strong and healthy and bold as you was should stop to speak to such a
limping bag of bones as I was. But you says to me, says you,
delivering it out of your chest as hearty as possible, so that it was
like a glass of something hot, ``What accident have you met with? You
have been badly hurt. What's amiss, old boy? Cheer up, and tell us
about it!<div class="bookquote">'' Cheer up! I was cheered already! I says as much to you,
you says more to me, I says more to you, you says more to me, and
here I am, commander! Here I am, commander!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>cries Phil, who has
started from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away. ``If a
mark's wanted, or if it will improve the business, let the customers
take aim at me. They can't spoil MY beauty. I<div class="bookquote">``M all right. Come on!
If they want a man to box at, let 'em box at me. Let 'em knock me
well about the head. I don't mind. If they want a light-weight to be
throwed for practice, Cornwall, Devonshire, or Lancashire, let 'em
throw me. They won't hurt ME. I have been throwed, all sorts of
styles, all my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>With this unexpected speech, energetically delivered and accompanied
by action illustrative of the various exercises referred to, Phil
Squod shoulders his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) way round three sides of the gallery, and
abruptly tacking off at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) commander, makes a butt at him (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>)
head, intended to express devotion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) service. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) then begins to
clear away the breakfast.

<p/>Mr. George, after laughing cheerfully and clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on the
shoulder, assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery
into business order. That done, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) takes a turn at the dumb-bells,
and afterwards weighing himself and opining that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is getting <div class="bookquote">``too
fleshy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>engages with great gravity in solitary broadsword practice.
Meanwhile Phil has fallen to work at his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) usual table, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) screws
and unscrews, and cleans, and files, and whistles into small
apertures, and blackens himself more and more, and seems to do and
undo everything that can be done and undone about a gun.

<p/>Master and man are at length disturbed by footsteps in the passage,
where they make an unusual sound, denoting the arrival of unusual
company. These steps, advancing nearer and nearer to the gallery,
bring into it a group at first sight scarcely reconcilable with any
day in the year but the fifth of November.

<p/>It consists of a limp and ugly figure carried in a chair by two
bearers and attended by a lean female with a face like a pinched
mask, who might be expected immediately to recite the popular verses
commemorative of the time when they did contrive to blow Old England
up alive but for her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) lips tightly and defiantly closed as
the chair is put down. At which point the figure in it gasping, <div class="bookquote">``O
Lord! Oh, dear me! I am shaken!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>adds, <div class="bookquote">``How de do, my dear friend,
how de do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George then descries, in the procession, the
venerable Mr. Smallweed out for an airing, attended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
granddaughter Judy as body-guard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed, removing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) right arm from the neck of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) bearers, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) has nearly
throttled coming along, <div class="bookquote">``how de do? You're surprised to see me, my
dear friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hardly have been more surprised to have seen your friend in
the city,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very seldom out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>pants Mr. Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't been out for
many months. It's inconvenient--and it comes expensive. But I longed
so much to see you, my dear Mr. George. How de do, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't be too well, my dear friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Smallweed takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) by
both hands. <div class="bookquote">``I have brought my granddaughter Judy. I couldn't keep
her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) longed so much to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum! She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) bears it calmly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>mutters Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So we got a hackney-cab, and put a chair in it, and just round the
corner they lifted me out of the cab and into the chair, and carried
me here that I might see my dear friend in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own establishment!
This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed, alluding to the bearer, who has
been in danger of strangulation and who withdraws adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
windpipe, <div class="bookquote">``is the driver of the cab. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has nothing extra. It is by
agreement included in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fare. This person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>the other bearer, <div class="bookquote">``we
engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer. Which is twopence.
Judy, give the person twopence. I was not sure you had a workman of
your own here, my dear friend, or we needn't have employed this
person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable
terror and a half-subdued <div class="bookquote">``O Lord! Oh, dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>Nor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
apprehension, on the surface of things, without some reason, for
Phil, who has never beheld the apparition in the black-velvet cap
before, has stopped short with a gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) hand with much of the air
of a dead shot intent on picking Mr. Smallweed off as an ugly old
bird of the crow species.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Judy, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed, <div class="bookquote">``give the person his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
twopence. It's a great deal for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>The person, who is one of those extraordinary specimens of human
fungus that spring up spontaneously in the western streets of London,
ready dressed in an old red jacket, with a <div class="bookquote">``mission''  (<font color='red'><b>The person</b></font>)</div>for holding
horses and calling coaches, received his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) twopence with anything but
transport, tosses the money into the air, catches it over-handed, and
retires.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed, <div class="bookquote">``would you be so
kind as help to carry me to the fire? I am accustomed to a fire, and
I am an old man, and I soon chill. Oh, dear me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) closing exclamation is jerked out of the venerable gentleman by
the suddenness with which Mr. Squod, like a genie, catches him (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) up,
chair and all, and deposits him (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) on the hearth-stone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Smallweed, panting. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me! Oh, my stars! My
dear friend, your workman is very strong--and very prompt. O Lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
is very prompt! Judy, draw me back a little. I'm being scorched in
the legs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which indeed is testified to the noses of all present by
the smell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) worsted stockings.

<p/>The gentle Judy, having backed her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) grandfather a little way from the
fire, and having shaken him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) up as usual, and having released his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
overshadowed eye from its black-velvet extinguisher, Mr. Smallweed
again says, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me! O Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>and looking about and meeting Mr.
George's glance, again stretches out both hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend! So happy in this meeting! And this is your
establishment? It's a delightful place. It's a picture! You never
find that anything goes off here accidentally, do you, my dear
friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>adds Grandfather Smallweed, very ill at ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. No fear of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your workman. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)--Oh, dear me!--he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) never lets anything off
without meaning it, does he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), my dear friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) has never hurt anybody but himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) might, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) seems to have hurt himself a good deal,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) might hurt somebody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>the old gentleman returns. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
mightn't mean it--or he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) even might. Mr. George, will you order him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to
leave his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) infernal fire-arms alone and go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Obedient to a nod from the trooper, Phil retires, empty-handed, to
the other end of the gallery. Mr. Smallweed, reassured, falls to
rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you're doing well, Mr. George?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) says to the trooper, squarely
standing faced about towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) broadsword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``You are prospering, please the Powers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George answers with a cool nod, adding, <div class="bookquote">``Go on. You have not come
to say that, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so sprightly, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandfather</b></font>)</div>returns the venerable
grandfather. <div class="bookquote">``You are such good company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha ha! Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend! But that sword looks awful gleaming and sharp. It
might cut somebody, by accident. It makes me shiver, Mr. George.
Curse him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the excellent old gentleman apart to Judy as the
trooper takes a step or two away to lay it aside. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) owes me money,
and might think of paying off old scores in this murdering place. I
wish your brimstone grandmother was here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'d shave her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) head
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George, returning, folds his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms, and looking down at the old
man, sliding every moment lower and lower in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair, says quietly,
<div class="bookquote">``Now for it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Smallweed, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) hands with an artful chuckle.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Now for it. Now for what, my dear friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a pipe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, who with great composure sets his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
chair in the chimney-corner, takes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe from the grate, fills it
and lights it, and falls to smoking peacefully.

<p/>This tends to the discomfiture of Mr. Smallweed, who finds it so
difficult to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) object, whatever it may be, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) becomes
exasperated and secretly claws the air with an impotent
vindictiveness expressive of an intense desire to tear and rend the
visage of Mr. George. As the excellent old gentleman's nails are long
and leaden, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands lean and veinous, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes green and
watery; and, over and above this, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) continues, while he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) claws, to
slide down in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair and to collapse into a shapeless bundle, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
becomes such a ghastly spectacle, even in the accustomed eyes of
Judy, that that young virgin pounces at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with something more than
the ardour of affection and so shakes him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up and pats and pokes him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
in divers parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) body, but particularly in that part which the
science of self-defence would call his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wind, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grievous
distress he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) utters enforced sounds like a paviour's rammer.

<p/>When Judy has by these means set him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up again in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair, with a
white face and a frosty nose -LRB-but still clawing-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) stretches out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) weazen forefinger and gives Mr. George one poke in the back. The
trooper raising his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) makes another poke at her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) esteemed
grandfather, and having thus brought them together, stares rigidly at
the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye! Ho, ho! U--u--u--ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>chatters</b></font>)</div>chatters Grandfather Smallweed,
swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) rage. <div class="bookquote">``My dear friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-still clawing-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to converse with me,
you must speak out. I am one of the roughs, and I can't go about and
about. I haven't the art to do it. I am not clever enough. It don't
suit me. When you go winding round and round me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper,
putting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe between his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips again, <div class="bookquote">``damme, if I don't feel as
if I was being smothered!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) inflates his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) broad chest to its utmost extent as if to assure
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is not smothered yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have come to give me a friendly call,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>continues Mr. George,
<div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to you; how are you? If you have come to see whether
there's any property on the premises, look about you; you are
welcome. If you want to out with something, out with it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>The blooming Judy, without removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) gaze from the fire, gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
grandfather one ghostly poke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see! It's her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) opinion too. And why the devil that young woman
won't sit down like a Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes
musingly fixed on Judy, <div class="bookquote">``I can't comprehend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) keeps at my side to attend to me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather
Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``I am an old man, my dear Mr. George, and I need some
attention. I can carry my years; I am not a brimstone poll-parrot''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-snarling and looking unconsciously for the cushion-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``but I need
attention, my dear friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper chair</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper, wheeling his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) chair to face the old man.
<div class="bookquote">``Now then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend in the city, Mr. George, has done a little business with a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>Grandfather Smallweed rubs his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) legs. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a fine young
soldier now, Mr. George, by the name of Carstone. Friends came
forward and paid it all up, honourable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think your friend in the city

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would, my dear friend. From you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I advise him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), then, to do no more business in that quarter. There's
no more to be got by it. The young gentleman, to my knowledge, is
brought to a dead halt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, my dear friend. No, no, Mr. George. No, no, no, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>remonstrates Grandfather Smallweed, cunningly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) spare legs.
<div class="bookquote">``Not quite a dead halt, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has good friends, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is good
for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pay, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is good for the selling price of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) commission,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is good for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chance in a lawsuit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is good for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
chance in a wife, and--oh, do you know, Mr. George, I think my friend
would consider the young gentleman good for something yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says
Grandfather Smallweed, turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) velvet cap and scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
ear like a monkey.

<p/>Mr. George, who has put aside his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe and sits with an arm on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
chair-back, beats a tattoo on the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) right foot as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
were not particularly pleased with the turn the conversation has
taken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But to pass from one subject to another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>resumes Mr. Smallweed.
<div class="bookquote">''`To promote the conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>as a joker might say. To pass, Mr.
George, from the ensign to the captain.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you up to, now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. George, pausing with a frown in
stroking the recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) moustache. <div class="bookquote">``What captain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our captain. The captain we know of. Captain Hawdon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! That's it, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George with a low whistle as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sees
both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are
there! Well? What about it? Come, I won't be smothered any more.
Speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returns the old man, <div class="bookquote">``I was applied--Judy, shake me

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bosh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>observes Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was your remark, my dear friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquires the old man with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bosh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. George, of my opinion you can
judge for yourself according to the questions asked of me and the

making the inquiries wants?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of the kind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be a lawyer, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms with an
air of confirmed resolution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is a lawyer, and a famous one. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wants to see
some fragment in Captain Hawdon's writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) don't want to keep it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) only wants to see it and compare it with a writing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. George. Happening to remember the advertisement concerning

WILL you shake hands? So glad you came that day! I should have missed
forming such a friendship if you hadn't come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Smallweed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George again after going through the
ceremony with some stiffness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no such thing. I have nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) signature. Plague
pestilence and famine, battle murder and sudden death upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says
the old man, making a curse out of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) few remembrances of a
prayer and squeezing up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) velvet cap between his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) angry hands, <div class="bookquote">``I
have half a million of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) signatures, I think! But you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>breathlessly recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mildness of speech as Judy re-adjusts the
cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) skittle-ball of a head, <div class="bookquote">``you, my dear Mr. George, are
likely to have some letter or paper that would suit the purpose.
Anything would suit the purpose, written in the hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some writing in that hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, pondering; <div class="bookquote">``may be, I
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May be, I have not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed, crest-fallen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I had bushels of it, I would not show as much as would make a
cartridge without knowing why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I have told you why. My dear Mr. George, I have told you why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I must know more,
and approve it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, will you come to the lawyer? My dear friend, will you come and
see the gentleman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>urges Grandfather Smallweed, pulling out a lean
old silver watch with hands like the leg of a skeleton. <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
it was probable I might call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) between ten and eleven this
forenoon, and it's now half after ten. Will you come and see the
gentleman, Mr. George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind that. Though why this should
concern you so much, I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything concerns me that has a chance in it of bringing anything
to light about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) take us all in? Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) owe us
immense sums, all round? Concern me? Who can anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
concern more than me? Not, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather
Smallweed, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) tone, <div class="bookquote">``that I want YOU to betray anything.
Far from it. Are you ready to come, my dear friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! I'll come in a moment. I promise nothing, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear Mr. George; no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you mean to say you're going to give me a lift to this place,
wherever it is, without charging for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George inquires,
getting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hat and thick wash-leather gloves.

<p/>This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) laughs, long and
low, before the fire. But ever while he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) laughs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) glances over his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
paralytic shoulder at Mr. George and eagerly watches him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the
gallery, looks here and there upon the higher shelves, and ultimately
takes something out with a rustling of paper, folds it, and puts it
in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breast. Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once, and Mr. Smallweed
pokes Judy once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, coming back. <div class="bookquote">``Phil, you can carry
this old gentleman to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) coach, and make nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me! O Lord! Stop a moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s so
very prompt! Are you sure you can do it carefully, my worthy man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil makes no reply, but seizing the chair and its load, sidles away,
tightly hugged by the now speechless Mr. Smallweed, and bolts along
the passage as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) had an acceptable commission to carry the old
gentleman to the nearest volcano. His (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) shorter trust, however,
terminating at the cab, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) deposits him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) there; and the fair Judy
takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) place beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>), and the chair embellishes the roof, and
Mr. George takes the vacant place upon the box.

<p/>Mr. George is quite confounded by the spectacle he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) beholds from time
to time as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) peeps into the cab through the window behind him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), where
the grim Judy is always motionless, and the old gentleman with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
cap over one eye is always sliding off the seat into the straw and
looking upward at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) other eye with a helpless expression
of being jolted in the back.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII

<p/>More Old Soldiers Than One


<p/>Mr. George has not far to ride with folded arms upon the box, for
their destination is Lincoln's Inn Fields. When the driver stops his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
horses, Mr. George alights, and looking in at the window, says,
<div class="bookquote">``What, Mr. Tulkinghorn's your man, is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear friend. Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), Mr. George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--seen him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) too, I think. But I don't know
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) don't know me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>There ensues the carrying of Mr. Smallweed upstairs, which is done to
perfection with the trooper's help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) is borne into Mr.
Tulkinghorn's great room and deposited on the Turkey rug before the
fire. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not within at the present moment but will be
back directly. The occupant of the pew in the hall, having said thus
much, stirs the fire and leaves the triumvirate to warm themselves.

<p/>Mr. George is mightily curious in respect of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looks up at
the painted ceiling, looks round at the old law-books, contemplates
the portraits of the great clients, reads aloud the names on the
boxes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,'''  (<font color='red'><b>the clients</b></font>)</div>Mr. George reads thoughtfully.
``Ha! ``Manor of Chesney Wold.<div class="bookquote">'' Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chesney</b></font>)</div>Mr. George stands looking at
these boxes a long while--as if they were pictures--and comes back to
the fire repeating, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and Manor of
Chesney Wold, hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worth a mint of money, Mr. George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>whispers Grandfather Smallweed,
rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) legs. <div class="bookquote">``Powerfully rich!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who do you mean? This old gentleman, or the Baronet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This gentleman, this gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I have heard; and knows a thing or two, I'll hold a wager. Not
bad quarters, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, looking round again. <div class="bookquote">``See the
strong-box yonder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>This reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn's arrival. There is no
change in him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), of course. Rustily drest, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spectacles in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
hand, and their very case worn threadbare. In manner, close and dry.
In voice, husky and low. In face, watchful behind a blind; habitually
not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps. The peerage may have
warmer worshippers and faithfuller believers than Mr. Tulkinghorn,
after all, if everything were known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Mr. Smallweed, good morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) comes in.
<div class="bookquote">``You have brought the sergeant, I see. Sit down, sergeant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Tulkinghorn takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) gloves and puts them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
looks with half-closed eyes across the room to where the trooper
stands and says within himself perchance, <div class="bookquote">``You'll do, my friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, sergeant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) repeats as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) comes to his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) table, which is
set on one side of the fire, and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) easy-chair. <div class="bookquote">``Cold and raw
this morning, cold and raw!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn warms before the bars,
alternately, the palms and knuckles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands and looks -LRB-from
behind that blind which is always down-RRB- at the trio sitting in a
little semicircle before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I can feel what I am about''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) can in two senses-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Smallweed.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The old gentleman is newly shaken up by Judy to bear
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) part in the conversation. <div class="bookquote">``You have brought our good friend the
sergeant, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Smallweed, very servile to the lawyer's
wealth and influence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does the sergeant say about this business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed with a tremulous wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)
shrivelled hand, <div class="bookquote">``this is the gentleman, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George salutes the gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and
profoundly silent--very forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair, as if the full
complement of regulation appendages for a field-day hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn proceeds, <div class="bookquote">``Well, George--I believe your name is
George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so, Sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper, <div class="bookquote">``but I should wish to
know what YOU say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean in point of reward?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean in point of everything, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>This is so very trying to Mr. Smallweed's temper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) suddenly
breaks out with <div class="bookquote">``You're a brimstone beast!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as suddenly asks
pardon of Mr. Tulkinghorn, excusing himself for this slip of the
tongue by saying to Judy, <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of your grandmother, my
dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I supposed, sergeant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) leans on one
side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chair and crosses his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) legs, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Smallweed might
have sufficiently explained the matter. It lies in the smallest
compass, however. You served under Captain Hawdon at one time, and
were his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) attendant in illness, and rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) many little services,
and were rather in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) confidence, I am told. That is so, is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, that is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George with military brevity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore you may happen to have in your possession
something--anything, no matter what; accounts, instructions, orders,
a letter, anything--in Captain Hawdon's writing. I wish to compare
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) writing with some that I have. If you can give me the
opportunity, you shall be rewarded for your trouble. Three, four,
five, guineas, you would consider handsome, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Noble, my dear friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>cries Grandfather Smallweed, screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If not, say how much more, in your conscience as a soldier, you can
demand. There is no need for you to part with the writing, against
your inclination--though I should prefer to have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George sits squared in exactly the same attitude, looks at the
painted ceiling, and says never a word. The irascible Mr. Smallweed
scratches the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The question is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) methodical, subdued,
uninterested way, <div class="bookquote">``first, whether you have any of Captain Hawdon's
writing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First, whether I have any of Captain Hawdon's writing, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>repeats
Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Secondly, what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirdly, you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, suddenly handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) some sheets of written
paper tied together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether it is at all like that, sir. Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. George.

<p/>All three repetitions Mr. George pronounces in a mechanical manner,
looking straight at Mr. Tulkinghorn; nor does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) so much as glance at
the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, that has been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) inspection -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) still holds it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hand-RRB-, but
continues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled meditation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>replies Mr. George, rising erect and looking immense, <div class="bookquote">``I
would rather, if you'll excuse me, have nothing to do with this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn, outwardly quite undisturbed, demands, <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper. <div class="bookquote">``Except on military compulsion, I am
not a man of business. Among civilians I am what they call in
Scotland a ne'er-do-weel. I have no head for papers, sir. I can stand
any fire better than a fire of cross questions. I mentioned to Mr.
Smallweed, only an hour or so ago, that when I come into things of
this kind I feel as if I was being smothered. And that is my
sensation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, looking round upon the company, <div class="bookquote">``at the
present moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) takes three strides forward to replace the papers on
the lawyer's table and three strides backward to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) former
station, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stands perfectly upright, now looking at the ground
and now at the painted ceiling, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as if to
prevent himself from accepting any other document whatever.

<p/>Under this provocation, Mr. Smallweed's favourite adjective of
disparagement is so close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) tongue that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) begins the words <div class="bookquote">``my
dear friend''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with the monosyllable <div class="bookquote">``brim,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thus converting the
possessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) speech. Once past this difficulty, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) exhorts his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) dear
friend in the tenderest manner not to be rash, but to do what so
eminent a gentleman requires, and to do it with a good grace,
confident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable. Mr.
Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence, as, <div class="bookquote">``You are the
best judge of your own interest, sergeant.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take care you do no harm
by this.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please yourself, please yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you know what you
mean, that's quite enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>These he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) utters with an appearance of
perfect indifference as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) looks over the papers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) table and
prepares to write a letter.

<p/>Mr. George looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the
ground, from the ground to Mr. Smallweed, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr.
Tulkinghorn, and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again,
often in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) perplexity changing the leg on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) rests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do assure you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``not to say it offensively,
that between you and Mr. Smallweed here, I really am being smothered
fifty times over. I really am, sir. I am not a match for you
gentlemen. Will you allow me to ask why you want to see the captain's
hand, in the case that I could find any specimen of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No. If you were a man of
business, sergeant, you would not need to be informed that there are
confidential reasons, very harmless in themselves, for many such
wants in the profession to which I belong. But if you are afraid of
doing any injury to Captain Hawdon, you may set your mind at rest
about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is dead, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``IS he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hat after another
disconcerted pause, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry not to have given you more
satisfaction. If it would be any satisfaction to any one that I
should be confirmed in my judgment that I would rather have nothing
to do with this by a friend of mine who has a better head for
business than I have, and who is an old soldier, I am willing to
consult with him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). I--I really am so completely smothered myself at
present,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand hopelessly across his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
brow, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't know but what it might be a satisfaction to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed, hearing that this authority is an old soldier, so
strongly inculcates the expediency of the trooper's taking counsel
with him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), and particularly informing him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) of its being a question of
five guineas or more, that Mr. George engages to go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Mr.
Tulkinghorn says nothing either way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll consult my friend, then, by your leave, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper,
<div class="bookquote">``and I'll take the liberty of looking in again with the final answer
in the course of the day. Mr. Smallweed, if you wish to be carried
downstairs--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a moment, my dear friend, in a moment. Will you first let me
speak half a word with this gentleman in private?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir. Don't hurry yourself on my account.''  (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div>The trooper
retires to a distant part of the room and resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) curious
inspection of the boxes, strong and otherwise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I wasn't as weak as a brimstone baby, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>whispers Grandfather
Smallweed, drawing the lawyer down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) level by the lapel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
coat and flashing some half-quenched green fire out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) angry
eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I'd tear the writing away from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s got it buttoned in
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breast. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) put it there. Judy saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) put it there. Speak
up, you crabbed image for the sign of a walking-stick shop, and say
you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) put it there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>This vehement conjuration the old gentleman accompanies with such a
thrust at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) granddaughter that it is too much for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) strength, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) slips away out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chair, drawing Mr. Tulkinghorn with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),
until he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is arrested by Judy, and well shaken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Violence will not do for me, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn then
remarks coolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I know, I know, sir. But it's chafing and
galling--it's--it's worse than your smattering chattering magpie of a
grandmother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>to the imperturbable Judy, who only looks at the fire,
<div class="bookquote">``to know he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has got what's wanted and won't give it up. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), not to
give it up! HE (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)! A vagabond! But never mind, sir, never mind. At the
most, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has only his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own way for a little while. I have him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
periodically in a vice. I'll twist him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), sir. I'll screw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), sir. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't do it with a good grace, I'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) do it with a bad one,
sir! Now, my dear Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed, winking at
the lawyer hideously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) releases him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am ready for your kind
assistance, my excellent friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn, with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting
itself through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) self-possession, stands on the hearth-rug with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
back to the fire, watching the disappearance of Mr. Smallweed and
acknowledging the trooper's parting salute with one slight nod.

<p/>It is more difficult to get rid of the old gentleman, Mr. George
finds, than to bear a hand in carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) downstairs, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is
replaced in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) conveyance, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is so loquacious on the subject of the
guineas and retains such an affectionate hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) button--having,
in truth, a secret longing to rip his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coat open and rob him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--that
some degree of force is necessary on the trooper's part to effect a
separation. It is accomplished at last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) proceeds alone in
quest of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) adviser.

<p/>By the cloisterly Temple, and by Whitefriars -LRB-there, not without a
glance at Hanging-Sword Alley, which would seem to be something in
his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) way-RRB-, and by Blackfriars Bridge, and Blackfriars Road, Mr. George
sedately marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that
ganglion of roads from Kent and Surrey, and of streets from the
bridges of London, centring in the far-famed elephant who has lost
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) castle formed of a thousand four-horse coaches to a stronger iron
monster than he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), ready to chop him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) into mince-meat any day he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dares.
To one of the little shops in this street, which is a musician's
shop, having a few fiddles in the window, and some Pan's pipes and a
tambourine, and a triangle, and certain elongated scraps of music,
Mr. George directs his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) massive tread. And halting at a few paces from
it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sees a soldierly looking woman, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) outer skirts
tucked up, come forth with a small wooden tub, and in that tub
commence a-whisking and a-splashing on the margin of the pavement,
Mr. George says to himself, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s as usual, washing greens. I never
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), except upon a baggage-waggon, when she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wasn't washing
greens!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>The subject of this reflection is at all events so occupied in
washing greens at present that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remains unsuspicious of Mr.
George's approach until, lifting up herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tub together when
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has poured the water off into the gutter, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finds him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) standing
near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is not flattering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George, I never see you but I wish you was a hundred mile away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper, without remarking on this welcome, follows into the
musical-instrument shop, where the lady places her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tub of greens upon
the counter, and having shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), rests her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms upon
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``George, consider Matthew Bagnet safe a minute
when you're near him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). You are that restless and that roving--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I know I am, Mrs. Bagnet. I know I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``What's the use of that? WHY
are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The nature of the animal, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper
good-humouredly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Bagnet, something shrilly. <div class="bookquote">``But what satisfaction
will the nature of the animal be to me when the animal shall have
tempted my Mat away from the musical business to New Zealand or
Australey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet is not at all an ill-looking woman. Rather large-boned, a
little coarse in the grain, and freckled by the sun and wind which
have tanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hair upon the forehead, but healthy, wholesome, and
bright-eyed. A strong, busy, active, honest-faced woman of from
forty-five to fifty. Clean, hardy, and so economically dressed
-LRB-though substantially-RRB- that the only article of ornament of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
stands possessed appear's to be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wedding-ring, around which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
finger has grown to be so large since it was put on that it will
never come off again until it shall mingle with Mrs. Bagnet's dust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bagnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, <div class="bookquote">``I am on my parole with you. Mat
will get no harm from me. You may trust me so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think I may. But the very looks of you are unsettling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Bagnet rejoins. ``Ah, George, George! If you had only settled down and
married Joe Pouch's widow when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pouch</b></font>) died in North America, SHE<div class="bookquote">``D have
combed your hair for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a chance for me, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper half
laughingly, half seriously, <div class="bookquote">``but I shall never settle down into a
respectable man now. Joe Pouch's widow might have done me good--there
was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and something of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)--but I couldn't make up my
mind to it. If I had had the luck to meet with such a wife as Mat
found!''

 (<font color='red'><b>trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet, who seems in a virtuous way to be under little reserve
with a good sort of fellow, but to be another good sort of fellow
herself for that matter, receives this compliment by flicking Mr.
George in the face with a head of greens and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) tub into the
little room behind the shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Quebec, my poppet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says George, following, on invitation, into
that department. <div class="bookquote">``And little Malta, too! Come and kiss your Bluffy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>These ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>These young ladies--not supposed to have been actually christened by
the names applied to them, though always so called in the family from
the places of their birth in barracks--are respectively employed on
three-legged stools, the younger -LRB-some five or six years old-RRB- in
learning her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) letters out of a penny primer, the elder -LRB-eight or nine
perhaps-RRB- in teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) and sewing with great assiduity. Both hail
Mr. George with acclamations as an old friend and after some kissing
and romping plant their stools beside him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how's young Woolwich?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! There now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Bagnet, turning about from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) saucepans
-LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is cooking dinner-RRB- with a bright flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Would
you believe it? Got an engagement at the theayter, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mat</b></font>) father,
to play the fife in a military piece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, my godson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. George, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>godson</b></font>)'s a Briton. That's what
Woolwich is. A Briton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mat blows away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mat</b></font>) bassoon, and you're respectable civilians
one and all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``Family people. Children growing up.
Mat's old mother in Scotland, and your old father somewhere else,
corresponded with, and helped a little, and--well, well! To be sure,
I don't know why I shouldn't be wished a hundred mile away, for I
have not much to do with all this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George is becoming thoughtful, sitting before the fire in the
whitewashed room, which has a sanded floor and a barrack smell and
contains nothing superfluous and has not a visible speck of dirt or
dust in it, from the faces of Quebec and Malta to the bright tin pots
and pannikins upon the dresser shelves--Mr. George is becoming
thoughtful, sitting here while Mrs. Bagnet is busy, when Mr. Bagnet
and young Woolwich opportunely come home. Mr. Bagnet is an
ex-artilleryman, tall and upright, with shaggy eyebrows and whiskers
like the fibres of a coco-nut, not a hair upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) head, and a torrid
complexion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) voice, short, deep, and resonant, is not at all
unlike the tones of the instrument to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is devoted. Indeed
there may be generally observed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) an unbending, unyielding,
brass-bound air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) were himself the bassoon of the human
orchestra. Young Woolwich is the type and model of a young drummer.

<p/>Both father and son salute the trooper heartily. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saying, in due
season, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has come to advise with Mr. Bagnet, Mr. Bagnet
hospitably declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) will hear of no business until after
dinner and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) friend shall not partake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) counsel without
first partaking of boiled pork and greens. The trooper yielding to
this invitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) and Mr. Bagnet, not to embarrass the domestic
preparations, go forth to take a turn up and down the little street,
which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms, as if it
were a rampart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``You know me. It's my old girl that
advises. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has the head. But I never own to it before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Discipline must be maintained. Wait till the greens is off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind.
Then we'll consult. Whatever the old girl says, do--do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I intend to, Mat,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replies the other. <div class="bookquote">``I would sooner take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
opinion than that of a college.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``College,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bagnet in short sentences, bassoon-like. <div class="bookquote">``What
college could you leave--in another quarter of the world--with
nothing but a grey cloak and an umbrella--to make its way home to
Europe? The old girl would do it to-morrow. Did it once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What college,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>pursues Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``could you set up in life--with two
penn`orth of white lime--a penn`orth of fuller's earth--a ha`porth of
sand--and the rest of the change out of sixpence in money? That's
what the old girl started on. In the present business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am rejoiced to hear it's thriving, Mat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet, acquiescing, <div class="bookquote">``saves. Has a stocking
somewhere. With money in it. I never saw it. But I know she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got it.
Wait till the greens is off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll set you up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a treasure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>exclaims Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s more. But I never own to it before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Discipline must be
maintained. It was the old girl that brought out my musical
abilities. I should have been in the artillery now but for the old
girl. Six years I hammered at the fiddle. Ten at the flute. The old
girl said it wouldn't do; intention good, but want of flexibility;
try the bassoon. The old girl borrowed a bassoon from the bandmaster
of the Rifle Regiment. I practised in the trenches. Got on, got
another, get a living by it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>George remarks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) looks as fresh as a rose and as sound as an
apple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet in reply, <div class="bookquote">``is a thoroughly fine
woman. Consequently she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is like a thoroughly fine day. Gets finer as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gets on. I never saw the old girl's equal. But I never own to it
before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Discipline must be maintained!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Proceeding to converse on indifferent matters, they walk up and down
the little street, keeping step and time, until summoned by Quebec
and Malta to do justice to the pork and greens, over which Mrs.
Bagnet, like a military chaplain, says a short grace. In the
distribution of these comestibles, as in every other household duty,
Mrs. Bagnet developes an exact system, sitting with every dish before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>), allotting to every portion of pork its own portion of
pot-liquor, greens, potatoes, and even mustard, and serving it out
complete. Having likewise served out the beer from a can and thus
supplied the mess with all things necessary, Mrs. Bagnet proceeds to
satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) own hunger, which is in a healthy state. The kit of the
mess, if the table furniture may be so denominated, is chiefly
composed of utensils of horn and tin that have done duty in several
parts of the world. Young Woolwich's knife, in particular, which is
of the oyster kind, with the additional feature of a strong
shutting-up movement which frequently balks the appetite of that
young musician, is mentioned as having gone in various hands the
complete round of foreign service.

<p/>The dinner done, Mrs. Bagnet, assisted by the younger branches -LRB-who
polish their own cups and platters, knives and forks-RRB-, makes all the
dinner garniture shine as brightly as before and puts it all away,
first sweeping the hearth, to the end that Mr. Bagnet and the visitor
may not be retarded in the smoking of their pipes. These household
cares involve much pattening and counter-pattening in the backyard
and considerable use of a pail, which is finally so happy as to
assist in the ablutions of Mrs. Bagnet herself. That old girl
reappearing by and by, quite fresh, and sitting down to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
needlework, then and only then--the greens being only then to be
considered as entirely off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind--Mr. Bagnet requests the trooper
to state his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) case.

<p/>This Mr. George does with great discretion, appearing to address
himself to Mr. Bagnet, but having an eye solely on the old girl all
the time, as Bagnet has himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>), equally discreet, busies
herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) needlework. The case fully stated, Mr. Bagnet
resorts to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) standard artifice for the maintenance of discipline.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the whole of it, is it, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the whole of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You act according to my opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be guided,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>replies George, <div class="bookquote">``entirely by it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) my opinion. You know it. Tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>It is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) cannot have too little to do with people who are too
deep for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) and cannot be too careful of interference with matters
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) does not understand--that the plain rule is to do nothing in the
dark, to be a party to nothing underhanded or mysterious, and never
to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) foot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) cannot see the ground. This, in effect, is
Mr. Bagnet's opinion, as delivered through the old girl, and it so
relieves Mr. George's mind by confirming his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own opinion and
banishing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) doubts that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) composes himself to smoke another pipe
on that exceptional occasion and to have a talk over old times with
the whole Bagnet family, according to their various ranges of
experience.

<p/>Through these means it comes to pass that Mr. George does not again
rise to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) full height in that parlour until the time is drawing on
when the bassoon and fife are expected by a British public at the
theatre; and as it takes time even then for Mr. George, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
domestic character of Bluffy, to take leave of Quebec and Malta and
insinuate a sponsorial shilling into the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) godson with
felicitations on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) success in life, it is dark when Mr. George
again turns his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face towards Lincoln's Inn Fields.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A family home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ruminates as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) marches along, <div class="bookquote">``however small it
is, makes a man like me look lonely. But it's well I never made that
evolution of matrimony. I shouldn't have been fit for it. I am such a
vagabond still, even at my present time of life, that I couldn't hold
to the gallery a month together if it was a regular pursuit or if I
didn't camp there, gipsy fashion. Come! I disgrace nobody and cumber
nobody; that's something. I have not done that for many a long year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whistles it off and marches on.

<p/>Arrived in Lincoln's Inn Fields and mounting Mr. Tulkinghorn's stair,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) finds the outer door closed and the chambers shut, but the trooper
not knowing much about outer doors, and the staircase being dark
besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is yet fumbling and groping about, hoping to discover a
bell-handle or to open the door for himself, when Mr. Tulkinghorn
comes up the stairs -LRB-quietly, of course-RRB- and angrily asks, <div class="bookquote">``Who is
that? What are you doing there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon, sir. It's George. The sergeant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And couldn't George, the sergeant, see that my door was locked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no, sir, I couldn't. At any rate, I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper,
rather nettled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you changed your mind? Or are you in the same mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Tulkinghorn demands. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) knows well enough at a glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the same mind, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so. That's sufficient. You can go. So you are the man,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) door with the key, <div class="bookquote">``in whose
hiding-place Mr. Gridley was found?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I AM the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, stopping two or three stairs
down. <div class="bookquote">``What then, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then? I don't like your associates. You should not have seen
the inside of my door this morning if I had thought of your being
that man. Gridley? A threatening, murderous, dangerous fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, spoken in an unusually high tone for him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), the
lawyer goes into his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) rooms and shuts the door with a thundering
noise.

<p/>Mr. George takes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dismissal in great dudgeon, the greater because
a clerk coming up the stairs has heard the last words of all and
evidently applies them to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``A pretty character to bear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>the
trooper growls with a hasty oath as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) strides downstairs. <div class="bookquote">``A
threatening, murderous, dangerous fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) sees
the clerk looking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) and marking him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) passes a lamp.
This so intensifies his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) dudgeon that for five minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is in an ill
humour. But he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) whistles that off like the rest of it and marches home
to the shooting gallery.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII

<p/>The Ironmaster


<p/>Sir Leicester Dedlock has got the better, for the time being, of the
family gout and is once more, in a literal no less than in a
figurative point of view, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) legs. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is at his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) place in
Lincolnshire; but the waters are out again on the low-lying grounds,
and the cold and damp steal into Chesney Wold, though well defended,
and eke into Sir Leicester's bones. The blazing fires of faggot and
coal--Dedlock timber and antediluvian forest--that blaze upon the
broad wide hearths and wink in the twilight on the frowning woods,
sullen to see how trees are sacrificed, do not exclude the enemy. The
hot-water pipes that trail themselves all over the house, the
cushioned doors and windows, and the screens and curtains fail to
supply the fires' deficiencies and to satisfy Sir Leicester's need.
Hence the fashionable intelligence proclaims one morning to the
listening earth that Lady Dedlock is expected shortly to return to
town for a few weeks.

<p/>It is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor
relations. Indeed great men have often more than their fair share of
poor relations, inasmuch as very red blood of the superior quality,
like inferior blood unlawfully shed, WILL cry aloud and WILL be
heard. Sir Leicester's cousins, in the remotest degree, are so many
murders in the respect that they <div class="bookquote">``will out.''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester cousins</b></font>)</div>Among whom there are
cousins who are so poor that one might almost dare to think it would
have been the happier for them never to have been plated links upon
the Dedlock chain of gold, but to have been made of common iron at
first and done base service.

<p/>Service, however -LRB-with a few limited reservations, genteel but not
profitable-RRB-, they may not do, being of the Dedlock dignity. So they
visit their richer cousins, and get into debt when they can, and live
but shabbily when they can't, and find--the women no husbands, and
the men no wives--and ride in borrowed carriages, and sit at feasts
that are never of their own making, and so go through high life. The
rich family sum has been divided by so many figures, and they are the
something over that nobody knows what to do with.

<p/>Everybody on Sir Leicester Dedlock's side of the question and of his (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>)
way of thinking would appear to be his (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) cousin more or less. From my
Lord Boodle, through the Duke of Foodle, down to Noodle, Sir
Leicester, like a glorious spider, stretches his (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) threads of
relationship. But while he (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) is stately in the cousinship of the
Everybodys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) is a kind and generous man, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) dignified
way, in the cousinship of the Nobodys; and at the present time, in
despite of the damp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boodle</b></font>) stays out the visit of several such cousins
at Chesney Wold with the constancy of a martyr.

<p/>Of these, foremost in the front rank stands Volumnia Dedlock, a young
lady -LRB-of sixty-RRB- who is doubly highly related, having the honour to be
a poor relation, by the mother's side, to another great family. Miss
Volumnia, displaying in early life a pretty talent for cutting
ornaments out of coloured paper, and also for singing to the guitar
in the Spanish tongue, and propounding French conundrums in country
houses, passed the twenty years of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) existence between twenty and
forty in a sufficiently agreeable manner. Lapsing then out of date
and being considered to bore mankind by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) vocal performances in the
Spanish language, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) retired to Bath, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lives slenderly on
an annual present from Sir Leicester and whence she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) makes occasional
resurrections in the country houses of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cousins. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has an
extensive acquaintance at Bath among appalling old gentlemen with
thin legs and nankeen trousers, and is of high standing in that
dreary city. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a little dreaded elsewhere in consequence of
an indiscreet profusion in the article of rouge and persistency in an
obsolete pearl necklace like a rosary of little bird's-eggs.

<p/>In any country in a wholesome state, Volumnia would be a clear case
for the pension list. Efforts have been made to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on it, and
when William Buffy came in, it was fully expected that her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) name would
be put down for a couple of hundred a year. But William Buffy somehow
discovered, contrary to all expectation, that these were not the
times when it could be done, and this was the first clear indication
Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) that the country was going
to pieces.

<p/>There is likewise the Honourable Bob Stables, who can make warm
mashes with the skill of a veterinary surgeon and is a better shot
than most gamekeepers. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) has been for some time particularly
desirous to serve his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) country in a post of good emoluments,
unaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility. In a well-regulated
body politic this natural desire on the part of a spirited young
gentleman so highly connected would be speedily recognized, but
somehow William Buffy found when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came in that these were not times
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could manage that little matter either, and this was the
second indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that the
country was going to pieces.

<p/>The rest of the cousins are ladies and gentlemen of various ages and
capacities, the major part amiable and sensible and likely to have
done well enough in life if they could have overcome their
cousinship; as it is, they are almost all a little worsted by it, and
lounge in purposeless and listless paths, and seem to be quite as
much at a loss how to dispose of themselves as anybody else can be
how to dispose of them.

<p/>In this society, and where not, my Lady Dedlock reigns supreme.
Beautiful, elegant, accomplished, and powerful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) little world
-LRB-for the world of fashion does not stretch ALL the way from pole to
pole-RRB-, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) influence in Sir Leicester's house, however haughty and
indifferent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) manner, is greatly to improve it and refine it. The
cousins, even those older cousins who were paralysed when Sir
Leicester married her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), do her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) feudal homage; and the Honourable Bob
Stables daily repeats to some chosen person between breakfast and
lunch his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) favourite original remark, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is the best-groomed
woman in the whole stud.

<p/>Such the guests in the long drawing-room at Chesney Wold this dismal
night when the step on the Ghost's Walk -LRB-inaudible here, however-RRB-
might be the step of a deceased cousin shut out in the cold. It is
near bed-time. Bedroom fires blaze brightly all over the house,
raising ghosts of grim furniture on wall and ceiling. Bedroom
candlesticks bristle on the distant table by the door, and cousins
yawn on ottomans. Cousins at the piano, cousins at the soda-water
tray, cousins rising from the card-table, cousins gathered round the
fire. Standing on one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own peculiar fire -LRB-for there are
two-RRB-, Sir Leicester. On the opposite side of the broad hearth, my
Lady at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) table. Volumnia, as one of the more privileged cousins,
in a luxurious chair between them. Sir Leicester glancing, with
magnificent displeasure, at the rouge and the pearl necklace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I occasionally meet on my staircase here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>drawls Volumnia, whose
thoughts perhaps are already hopping up it to bed, after a long
evening of very desultory talk, <div class="bookquote">``one of the prettiest girls, I think,
that I ever saw in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A PROTEGEE of my Lady's,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so. I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked
that girl out. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really is a marvel. A dolly sort of beauty
perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Miss Volumnia, reserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own sort, <div class="bookquote">``but in its
way, perfect; such bloom I never saw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester, with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) magnificent glance of displeasure at the
rouge, appears to say so too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>remarks my Lady languidly, <div class="bookquote">``if there is any uncommon eye in
the case, it is Mrs. Rouncewell's, and not mine. Rosa is her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
discovery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your maid, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. My anything; pet--secretary--messenger--I don't know what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) about you, as you would like to have a flower,
or a bird, or a picture, or a poodle--no, not a poodle, though--or
anything else that was equally pretty?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Volumnia, sympathizing.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, how charming now! And how well that delightful old soul Mrs.
Rouncewell is looking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) must be an immense age, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is as
active and handsome! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is the dearest friend I have, positively!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester feels it to be right and fitting that the housekeeper
of Chesney Wold should be a remarkable person. Apart from that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>)
has a real regard for Mrs. Rouncewell and likes to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) praised.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``You are right, Volumnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which Volumnia is extremely
glad to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) has no daughter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) own, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Rouncewell? No, Volumnia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) has a son. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) had two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady, whose chronic malady of boredom has been sadly aggravated by
Volumnia this evening, glances wearily towards the candlesticks and
heaves a noiseless sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the
present age has fallen; of the obliteration of landmarks, the opening
of floodgates, and the uprooting of distinctions,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester
with stately gloom, <div class="bookquote">``that I have been informed by Mr. Tulkinghorn
that Mrs. Rouncewell's son has been invited to go into Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a scream</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Volumnia utters a little sharp scream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeats Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Into Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard of such a thing! Good gracious, what is the man?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaims Volumnia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is called, I believe--an--ironmaster.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester says it
slowly and with gravity and doubt, as not being sure but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) is
called a lead-mistress or that the right word may be some other word
expressive of some other relationship to some other metal.

<p/>Volumnia utters another little scream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has declined the proposal, if my information from Mr. Tulkinghorn
be correct, as I have no doubt it is. Mr. Tulkinghorn being always
correct and exact; still that does not,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``that
does not lessen the anomaly, which is fraught with strange
considerations--startling considerations, as it appears to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Volumnia rising with a look candlestick-wards, Sir Leicester
politely performs the grand tour of the drawing-room, brings one, and
lights it at my Lady's shaded lamp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must beg you, my Lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) says while doing so, <div class="bookquote">``to remain a few
moments, for this individual of whom I speak arrived this evening
shortly before dinner and requested in a very becoming note'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--Sir
Leicester, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) habitual regard to truth, dwells upon it--<div class="bookquote">``I am
bound to say, in a very becoming and well-expressed note, the favour
of a short interview with yourself and MYself on the subject of this
young girl. As it appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) wished to depart to-night, I
replied that we would see him (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) before retiring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Volumnia with a third little scream takes flight, wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
hosts--O Lud!--well rid of the--what is it?--ironmaster!

<p/>The other cousins soon disperse, to the last cousin there. Sir
Leicester rings the bell, <div class="bookquote">``Make my compliments to Mr. Rouncewell, in
the housekeeper's apartments, and say I can receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady, who has heard all this with slight attention outwardly,
looks towards Mr. Rouncewell as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) comes in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is a little over
fifty perhaps, of a good figure, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) mother, and has a clear
voice, a broad forehead from which his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) dark hair has retired, and a
shrewd though open face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is a responsible-looking gentleman
dressed in black, portly enough, but strong and active. Has a
perfectly natural and easy air and is not in the least embarrassed by
the great presence into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) comes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, as I have already apologized for
intruding on you, I cannot do better than be very brief. I thank you,
Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The head of the Dedlocks has motioned towards a sofa between himself
and my Lady. Mr. Rouncewell quietly takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) seat there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In these busy times, when so many great undertakings are in
progress, people like myself have so many workmen in so many places
that we are always on the flight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester is content enough that the ironmaster should feel that
there is no hurry there; there, in that ancient house, rooted in that
quiet park, where the ivy and the moss have had time to mature, and
the gnarled and warted elms and the umbrageous oaks stand deep in the
fern and leaves of a hundred years; and where the sun-dial on the
terrace has dumbly recorded for centuries that time which was as much
the property of every Dedlock--while he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) lasted--as the house and
lands. Sir Leicester sits down in an easy-chair, opposing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) repose
and that of Chesney Wold to the restless flights of ironmasters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock has been so kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>proceeds Mr. Rouncewell with a
respectful glance and a bow that way, <div class="bookquote">``as to place near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) a young
beauty of the name of Rosa. Now, my son has fallen in love with Rosa
and has asked my consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) proposing marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and to
their becoming engaged if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>)--which I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
will. I have never seen Rosa until to-day, but I have some confidence
in my son's good sense--even in love. I find her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) represents
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), to the best of my judgment; and my mother speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with
great commendation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in all respects deserves it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am happy, Lady Dedlock, that you say so, and I need not comment on
the value to me of your kind opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester with unspeakable grandeur, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
thinks the ironmaster a little too glib, <div class="bookquote">``must be quite unnecessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite unnecessary, Sir Leicester. Now, my son is a very young man,
and Rosa is a very young woman. As I made my way, so my son must make
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) being married at present is out of the question. But
supposing I gave my consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) engaging himself to this pretty
girl, if this pretty girl will engage herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), I think it a
piece of candour to say at once--I am sure, Sir Leicester and Lady
Dedlock, you will understand and excuse me--I should make it a
condition that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) did not remain at Chesney Wold. Therefore, before
communicating further with my son, I take the liberty of saying that
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) removal would be in any way inconvenient or objectionable, I
will hold the matter over with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) for any reasonable time and leave
it precisely where it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chesney</b></font>)</div><p/>Not remain at Chesney Wold! Make it a condition! All Sir Leicester's
old misgivings relative to Wat Tyler and the people in the iron
districts who do nothing but turn out by torchlight come in a shower
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) head, the fine grey hair of which, as well as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>)
whiskers, actually stirs with indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to understand, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``and is my Lady to
understand'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) in thus specially, first as a point of
gallantry, and next as a point of prudence, having great reliance on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sense--<div class="bookquote">``am I to understand, Mr. Rouncewell, and is my Lady to
understand, sir, that you consider this young woman too good for
Chesney Wold or likely to be injured by remaining here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not, Sir Leicester,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester very lofty indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Mr. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady, warning Sir Leicester off with
the slightest gesture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) pretty hand, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) were a fly,
<div class="bookquote">``explain to me what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Willingly, Lady Dedlock. There is nothing I could desire more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Saxon</b></font>)</div><p/>Addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) composed face, whose intelligence, however, is too
quick and active to be concealed by any studied impassiveness,
however habitual, to the strong Saxon face of the visitor, a picture
of resolution and perseverance, my Lady listens with attention,
occasionally slightly bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the son of your housekeeper, Lady Dedlock, and passed my
childhood about this house. My mother has lived here half a
century and will die here I have no doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is one of those
examples--perhaps as good a one as there is--of love, and attachment,
and fidelity in such a nation, which England may well be proud of,
but of which no order can appropriate the whole pride or the whole
merit, because such an instance bespeaks high worth on two sides--on
the great side assuredly, on the small one no less assuredly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester snorts a little to hear the law laid down in this way,
but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) honour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) love of truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) freely, though silently,
admits the justice of the ironmaster's proposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me for saying what is so obvious, but I wouldn't have it
hastily supposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with the least turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) eyes towards Sir
Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``that I am ashamed of my mother's position here, or
wanting in all just respect for Chesney Wold and the family.
I certainly may have desired--I certainly have desired, Lady
Dedlock--that my mother should retire after so many years and end
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) days with me. But as I have found that to sever this strong bond
would be to break her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart, I have long abandoned that idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester very magnificent again at the notion of Mrs. Rouncewell
being spirited off from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) natural home to end her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) days with an
ironmaster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>proceeds the visitor in a modest, clear way, <div class="bookquote">``an
apprentice and a workman. I have lived on workman's wages, years and
years, and beyond a certain point have had to educate myself. My wife
was a foreman's daughter, and plainly brought up. We have three
daughters besides this son of whom I have spoken, and being
fortunately able to give them greater advantages than we have had
ourselves, we have educated them well, very well. It has been one of
our great cares and pleasures to make them worthy of any station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>A little boastfulness in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) fatherly tone here, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) added in
his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) heart, <div class="bookquote">``even of the Chesney Wold station.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Not a little more
magnificence, therefore, on the part of Sir Leicester.

<p/>``All this is so frequent, Lady Dedlock, where I live, and among the
class to which I belong, that what would be generally called unequal
marriages are not of such rare occurrence with us as elsewhere. A son
will sometimes make it known to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has fallen in
love, say, with a young woman in the factory. The father, who once
worked in a factory himself, will be a little disappointed at first
very possibly. It may be that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had other views for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son.
However, the chances are that having ascertained the young woman to
be of unblemished character, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) will say to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) son, ``I must be quite
sure you are in earnest here. This is a serious matter for both of
you. Therefore I shall have this girl educated for two years,'' or it
may be, ``I shall place this girl at the same school with your sisters
for such a time, during which you will give me your word and honour
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only so often. If at the expiration of that time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
has so far profited by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) advantages as that you may be upon a fair
equality, you are both in the same mind, I will do my part to make
you happy.<div class="bookquote">'' I know of several cases such as I describe, my Lady, and
I think they indicate to me my own course now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester's magnificence explodes. Calmly, but terribly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) right hand in the
breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) blue coat, the attitude of state in which he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is painted
in the gallery, <div class="bookquote">``do you draw a parallel between Chesney Wold and a--''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) resists a disposition to choke, <div class="bookquote">``a factory?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I need not reply, Sir Leicester, that the two places are very
different; but for the purposes of this case, I think a parallel may
be justly drawn between them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester directs his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) majestic glance down one side of the long
drawing-room and up the other before he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) can believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you aware, sir, that this young woman whom my Lady--my Lady--has
placed near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) person was brought up at the village school outside
the gates?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester, I am quite aware of it. A very good school it is, and
handsomely supported by this family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``the application of
what you have said is, to me, incomprehensible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be more comprehensible, Sir Leicester, if I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div>the
ironmaster is reddening a little, <div class="bookquote">``that I do not regard the village
school as teaching everything desirable to be known by my son's
wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div><p/>From the village school of Chesney Wold, intact as it is this minute,
to the whole framework of society; from the whole framework of
society, to the aforesaid framework receiving tremendous cracks in
consequence of people -LRB-iron-masters, lead-mistresses, and what not-RRB-
not minding their catechism, and getting out of the station unto
which they are called--necessarily and for ever, according to Sir
Leicester's rapid logic, the first station in which they happen to
find themselves; and from that, to their educating other people out
of THEIR stations, and so obliterating the landmarks, and opening the
floodgates, and all the rest of it; this is the swift progress of the
Dedlock mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady, I beg your pardon. Permit me, for one moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) has
given a faint indication of intending to speak. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rouncewell, our
views of duty, and our views of station, and our views of education,
and our views of--in short, ALL our views--are so diametrically
opposed, that to prolong this discussion must be repellent to your
feelings and repellent to my own. This young woman is honoured with
my Lady's notice and favour. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wishes to withdraw herself from
that notice and favour or if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chooses to place herself under the
influence of any one who may in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) peculiar opinions--you will allow
me to say, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) peculiar opinions, though I readily admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
is not accountable for them to me--who may, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) peculiar opinions,
withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from that notice and favour, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is at any time at
liberty to do so. We are obliged to you for the plainness with which
you have spoken. It will have no effect of itself, one way or other,
on the young woman's position here. Beyond this, we can make no
terms; and here we beg--if you will be so good--to leave the
subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>The visitor pauses a moment to give my Lady an opportunity, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
says nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) then rises and replies, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester and Lady
Dedlock, allow me to thank you for your attention and only to observe
that I shall very seriously recommend my son to conquer his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) present
inclinations. Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester with all the nature of a
gentleman shining in him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it is late, and the roads are dark. I hope
your time is not so precious but that you will allow my Lady and
myself to offer you the hospitality of Chesney Wold, for to-night at
least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>adds my Lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you, but I have to travel all night in order to
reach a distant part of the country punctually at an appointed time
in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div><p/>Therewith the ironmaster takes his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) departure, Sir Leicester ringing
the bell and my Lady rising as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leaves the room.

<p/>When my Lady goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) boudoir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sits down thoughtfully by the
fire, and inattentive to the Ghost's Walk, looks at Rosa, writing in
an inner room. Presently my Lady calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to me, child. Tell me the truth. Are you in love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! My Lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady, looking at the downcast and blushing face, says smiling,
<div class="bookquote">``Who is it? Is it Mrs. Rouncewell's grandson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you please, my Lady. But I don't know that I am in love with
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>)--yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet, you silly little thing! Do you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) loves YOU, yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) likes me a little, my Lady.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div>And Rosa bursts into tears.

<p/>Is this Lady Dedlock standing beside the village beauty, smoothing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) dark hair with that motherly touch, and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) with eyes so
full of musing interest? Aye, indeed it is!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, child. You are young and true, and I believe you are
attached to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am, my Lady. Indeed there is nothing in the world I
wouldn't do to show how much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't think you would wish to leave me just yet, Rosa, even
for a lover?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my Lady! Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div>Rosa looks up for the first time, quite
frightened at the thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confide in me, my child. Don't fear me. I wish you to be happy, and
will make you so--if I can make anybody happy on this earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosa, with fresh tears, kneels at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) feet and kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand. My
Lady takes the hand with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has caught it, and standing with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) eyes fixed on the fire, puts it about and about between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own
two hands, and gradually lets it fall. Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) so absorbed, Rosa
softly withdraws; but still my Lady's eyes are on the fire.

<p/>In search of what? Of any hand that is no more, of any hand that
never was, of any touch that might have magically changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) life?
Or does she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) listen to the Ghost's Walk and think what step does it
most resemble? A man's? A woman's? The pattering of a little child's
feet, ever coming on--on--on? Some melancholy influence is upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
or why should so proud a lady close the doors and sit alone upon the
hearth so desolate?

<p/>Volumnia is away next day, and all the cousins are scattered before
dinner. Not a cousin of the batch but is amazed to hear from Sir
Leicester at breakfast-time of the obliteration of landmarks, and
opening of floodgates, and cracking of the framework of society,
manifested through Mrs. Rouncewell's son. Not a cousin of the batch
but is really indignant, and connects it with the feebleness of
William Buffy when in office, and really does feel deprived of a
stake in the country--or the pension list--or something--by fraud and
wrong. As to Volumnia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) is handed down the great staircase by Sir
Leicester, as eloquent upon the theme as if there were a general
rising in the north of England to obtain her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) rouge-pot and pearl
necklace. And thus, with a clatter of maids and valets--for it is one
appurtenance of their cousinship that however difficult they may find
it to keep themselves, they MUST keep maids and valets--the cousins
disperse to the four winds of heaven; and the one wintry wind that
blows to-day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house,
as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX

<p/>The Young Man


<p/>Chesney Wold is shut up, carpets are rolled into great scrolls in
corners of comfortless rooms, bright damask does penance in brown
holland, carving and gilding puts on mortification, and the Dedlock
ancestors retire from the light of day again. Around and around the
house the leaves fall thick, but never fast, for they come circling
down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow. Let the gardener
sweep and sweep the turf as he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) will, and press the leaves into full
barrows, and wheel them off, still they lie ankle-deep. Howls the
shrill wind round Chesney Wold; the sharp rain beats, the windows
rattle, and the chimneys growl. Mists hide in the avenues, veil the
points of view, and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds.
On all the house there is a cold, blank smell like the smell of a
little church, though something dryer, suggesting that the dead and
buried Dedlocks walk there in the long nights and leave the flavour
of their graves behind them.

<p/>But the house in town, which is rarely in the same mind as Chesney
Wold at the same time, seldom rejoicing when it rejoices or mourning
when it mourns, excepting when a Dedlock dies--the house in town
shines out awakened. As warm and bright as so much state may be, as
delicately redolent of pleasant scents that bear no trace of winter
as hothouse flowers can make it, soft and hushed so that the ticking
of the clocks and the crisp burning of the fires alone disturb the
stillness in the rooms, it seems to wrap those chilled bones of Sir
Leicester's in rainbow-coloured wool. And Sir Leicester is glad to
repose in dignified contentment before the great fire in the library,
condescendingly perusing the backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) books or honouring the fine
arts with a glance of approbation. For he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pictures, ancient
and modern. Some of the Fancy Ball School in which art occasionally
condescends to become a master, which would be best catalogued like
the miscellaneous articles in a sale. As <div class="bookquote">``Three high-backed chairs, a
table and cover, long-necked bottle -LRB-containing wine-RRB-, one flask, one
Spanish female's costume, three-quarter face portrait of Miss Jogg
the model, and a suit of armour containing Don Quixote.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Or <div class="bookquote">``One
stone terrace -LRB-cracked-RRB-, one gondola in distance, one Venetian
senator's dress complete, richly embroidered white satin costume with
profile portrait of Miss Jogg the model, one Scimitar superbly
mounted in gold with jewelled handle, elaborate Moorish dress -LRB-very
rare-RRB-, and Othello.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often, there being estate
business to do, leases to be renewed, and so on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) sees my Lady
pretty often, too; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) are as composed, and as
indifferent, and take as little heed of one another, as ever. Yet it
may be that my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) knows it.
It may be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pursues her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) doggedly and steadily, with no touch of
compunction, remorse, or pity. It may be that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) beauty and all the
state and brilliancy surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) only gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) the greater zest
for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is set upon and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) the more inflexible in it.
Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) be cold and cruel, whether immovable in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) duty, whether absorbed in love of power, whether determined
to have nothing hidden from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) in ground where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has burrowed
among secrets all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) life, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) heart despises the
splendour of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is a distant beam, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is always
treasuring up slights and offences in the affability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) gorgeous
clients--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) be any of this, or all of this, it may be that my
Lady had better have five thousand pairs of fashionable eyes upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), in distrustful vigilance, than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer
with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) wisp of neckcloth and his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) dull black breeches tied with
ribbons at the knees.

<p/>Sir Leicester sits in my Lady's room--that room in which Mr.
Tulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce--particularly
complacent. My Lady, as on that day, sits before the fire with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
screen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hand. Sir Leicester is particularly complacent because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly
on the floodgates and the framework of society. They apply so happily
to the late case that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my
Lady's room expressly to read them aloud. <div class="bookquote">``The man who wrote this
article,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) observes by way of preface, nodding at the fire as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
were nodding down at the man from a mount, <div class="bookquote">``has a well-balanced
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man's mind is not so well balanced but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bores my Lady,
who, after a languid effort to listen, or rather a languid
resignation of herself to a show of listening, becomes distraught and
falls into a contemplation of the fire as if it were her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fire at
Chesney Wold, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had never left it. Sir Leicester, quite
unconscious, reads on through his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) double eye-glass, occasionally
stopping to remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) glass and express approval, as <div class="bookquote">``Very true
indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very properly put,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have frequently made the same remark
myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>invariably losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) place after each observation, and
going up and down the column to find it again.

<p/>Sir Leicester is reading with infinite gravity and state when the
door opens, and the Mercury in powder makes this strange
announcement, <div class="bookquote">``The young man, my Lady, of the name of Guppy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester pauses, stares, repeats in a killing voice, <div class="bookquote">``The young
man of the name of Guppy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) beholds the young man of the name of Guppy, much
discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of
introduction in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) manner and appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester to Mercury, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean by
announcing with this abruptness a young man of the name of Guppy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Sir Leicester, but my Lady said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would see the
young man whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called. I was not aware that you were here, Sir
Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>With this apology, Mercury directs a scornful and indignant look at
the young man of the name of Guppy which plainly says, <div class="bookquote">``What do you
come calling here for and getting ME into a row?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quite right. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) those directions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady. <div class="bookquote">``Let
the young man wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means, my Lady. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has your orders to come, I will not
interrupt you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gallantry retires, rather
declining to accept a bow from the young man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes out and
majestically supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be some shoemaker of intrusive
appearance.

<p/>Lady Dedlock looks imperiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) visitor when the servant has
left the room, casting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) eyes over him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) from head to foot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
suffers him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to stand by the door and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That your ladyship would have the kindness to oblige me with a
little conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Guppy, embarrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are, of course, the person who has written me so many letters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Several, your ladyship. Several before your ladyship condescended to
favour me with an answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation
unnecessary? Can you not still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy screws his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mouth into a silent <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>and shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been strangely importunate. If it should appear, after all,
that what you have to say does not concern me--and I don't know how
it can, and don't expect that it will--you will allow me to cut you
short with but little ceremony. Say what you have to say, if you
please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady, with a careless toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) screen, turns herself towards
the fire again, sitting almost with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) back to the young man of the
name of Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With your ladyship's permission, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the young man, <div class="bookquote">``I will
now enter on my business. Hem! I am, as I told your ladyship in my
first letter, in the law. Being in the law, I have learnt the habit
of not committing myself in writing, and therefore I did not mention
to your ladyship the name of the firm with which I am connected and
in which my standing--and I may add income--is tolerably good. I may
now state to your ladyship, in confidence, that the name of that firm
is Kenge and Carboy, of Lincoln's Inn, which may not be altogether
unknown to your ladyship in connexion with the case in Chancery of
Jarndyce and Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady's figure begins to be expressive of some attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has
ceased to toss the screen and holds it as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) were listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I may say to your ladyship at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, a little
emboldened, <div class="bookquote">``it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce
that made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship, which conduct I
have no doubt did appear, and does appear, obtrusive--in fact, almost
blackguardly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary,
and not receiving any, Mr. Guppy proceeds, <div class="bookquote">``If it had been Jarndyce
and Jarndyce, I should have gone at once to your ladyship's
solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, of the Fields. I have the pleasure of
being acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn--at least we move when we meet
one another--and if it had been any business of that sort, I should
have gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady turns a little round and says, <div class="bookquote">``You had better sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank your ladyship.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy does so. <div class="bookquote">``Now, your ladyship'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>--Mr.
Guppy refers to a little slip of paper on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has made small
notes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) line of argument and which seems to involve him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) in the
densest obscurity whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) looks at it--<div class="bookquote">``I--Oh, yes!--I place
myself entirely in your ladyship's hands. If your ladyship was to
make any complaint to Kenge and Carboy or to Mr. Tulkinghorn of the
present visit, I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation.
That, I openly admit. Consequently, I rely upon your ladyship's
honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady, with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen,
assures him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) being worth no complaint from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy; <div class="bookquote">``quite satisfactory.
Now--I--dash it!--The fact is that I put down a head or two here of
the order of the points I thought of touching upon, and they're
written short, and I can't quite make out what they mean. If your
ladyship will excuse me taking it to the window half a moment, I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy, going to the window, tumbles into a pair of love-birds, to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) says in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) confusion, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, I am sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This
does not tend to the greater legibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) notes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) murmurs,
growing warm and red and holding the slip of paper now close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
eyes, now a long way off, <div class="bookquote">``C.S. What's C.S. for? Oh! C.S.! Oh, I
know! Yes, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And comes back enlightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, standing midway between my Lady and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``whether your ladyship ever happened to hear of, or to
see, a young lady of the name of Miss Esther Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady chair</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady's eyes look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) full. <div class="bookquote">``I saw a young lady of that name not
long ago. This past autumn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, did it strike your ladyship that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was like anybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>asks
Mr. Guppy, crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) arms, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head on one side, and
scratching the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) memoranda.

<p/>My Lady removes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) eyes from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not like your ladyship's family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``can hardly remember Miss
Summerson's face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember the young lady very well. What has this to do with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship, I do assure you that having Miss Summerson's image
imprinted on my `eart--which I mention in confidence--I found, when I
had the honour of going over your ladyship's mansion of Chesney Wold
while on a short out in the county of Lincolnshire with a friend,
such a resemblance between Miss Esther Summerson and your ladyship's
own portrait that it completely knocked me over, so much so that I
didn't at the moment even know what it WAS that knocked me over. And
now I have the honour of beholding your ladyship near -LRB-I have often,
since that, taken the liberty of looking at your ladyship in your
carriage in the park, when I dare say you was not aware of me, but I
never saw your ladyship so near-RRB-, it's really more surprising than I
thought it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>Young man of the name of Guppy! There have been times, when ladies
lived in strongholds and had unscrupulous attendants within call,
when that poor life of yours would NOT have been worth a minute's
purchase, with those beautiful eyes looking at you as they look at
this moment.

<p/>My Lady, slowly using her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) little hand-screen as a fan, asks him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) again
what he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) supposes that his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) taste for likenesses has to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>replies Mr. Guppy, again referring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) paper, ``I
am coming to that. Dash these notes! Oh! ``Mrs. Chadband.<div class="bookquote">'' Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Guppy draws his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) chair a little forward and seats himself again. My
Lady reclines in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) chair composedly, though with a trifle less of
graceful ease than usual perhaps, and never falters in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) steady
gaze. <div class="bookquote">``A--stop a minute, though!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy refers again. <div class="bookquote">``E.S.
twice? Oh, yes! Yes, I see my way now, right on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rolling up the slip of paper as an instrument to point his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) speech
with, Mr. Guppy proceeds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship, there is a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson's
birth and bringing up. I am informed of that fact because--which I
mention in confidence--I know it in the way of my profession at Kenge
and Carboy's. Now, as I have already mentioned to your ladyship, Miss
Summerson's image is imprinted on my `eart. If I could clear this
mystery for her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>), or prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) to be well related, or find that having
the honour to be a remote branch of your ladyship's family she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) had a
right to be made a party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, why, I might make
a sort of a claim upon Miss Summerson to look with an eye of more
dedicated favour on my proposals than she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) has exactly done as yet. In
fact, as yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) hasn't favoured them at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>A kind of angry smile just dawns upon my Lady's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, it's a very singular circumstance, your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of
us professional men--which I may call myself, for though not
admitted, yet I have had a present of my articles made to me by Kenge
and Carboy, on my mother's advancing from the principal of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little
income the money for the stamp, which comes heavy--that I have
encountered the person who lived as servant with the lady who brought
Miss Summerson up before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>). That lady
was a Miss Barbary, your ladyship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Is the dead colour on my Lady's face reflected from the screen which
has a green silk ground and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) holds in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) raised hand as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had forgotten it, or is it a dreadful paleness that has fallen on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``ever happen to hear of Miss
Barbary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I think so. Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship's family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My Lady's lips move, but they utter nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``NOT connected?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Not to your ladyship's
knowledge, perhaps? Ah! But might be? Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After each of these
interrogatories, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Very good! Now, this
Miss Barbary was extremely close--seems to have been extraordinarily
close for a female, females being generally -LRB-in common life at least-RRB-
rather given to conversation--and my witness never had an idea
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) possessed a single relative. On one occasion, and only
one, she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) seems to have been confidential to my witness on a single
point, and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) that the little girl's real name was not
Esther Summerson, but Esther Hawdon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy stares. Lady Dedlock sits before him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) through,
with the same dark shade upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) face, in the same attitude even to
the holding of the screen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) lips a little apart, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) brow a
little contracted, but for the moment dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) consciousness
return, sees a tremor pass across her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) frame like a ripple over water,
sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) lips shake, sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) compose them by a great effort, sees
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) force herself back to the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) presence and of what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has said. All this, so quickly, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) exclamation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) dead
condition seem to have passed away like the features of those
long-preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs, which,
struck by the air like lightning, vanish in a breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of Hawdon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard it before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Name of any collateral or remote branch of your ladyship's family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``I come to the last point of
the case, so far as I have got it up. It's going on, and I shall
gather it up closer and closer as it goes on. Your ladyship must
know--if your ladyship don't happen, by any chance, to know
already--that there was found dead at the house of a person named
Krook, near Chancery Lane, some time ago, a law-writer in great
distress. Upon which law-writer there was an inquest, and which
law-writer was an anonymous character, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) name being unknown. But,
your ladyship, I have discovered very lately that that law-writer's
name was Hawdon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is THAT to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, your ladyship, that's the question! Now, your ladyship, a queer
thing happened after that man's death. A lady started up, a disguised
lady, your ladyship, who went to look at the scene of action and went
to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grave. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in
corroboration of this statement, I can lay my hand upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at any
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The wretched boy is nothing to my Lady, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) does NOT wish to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) produced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I assure your ladyship it's a very queer start indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``If you was to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tell about the rings that sparkled on
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glove off, you'd think it quite
romantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There are diamonds glittering on the hand that holds the screen. My
Lady trifles with the screen and makes them glitter more, again with
that expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to
the young man of the name of Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was supposed, your ladyship, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left no rag or scrap behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could be possibly identified. But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left a
bundle of old letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The screen still goes, as before. All this time her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) eyes never once
release him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were taken and secreted. And to-morrow night, your ladyship,
they will come into my possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still I ask you, what is this to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship, I conclude with that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy rises. <div class="bookquote">``If you think
there's enough in this chain of circumstances put together--in the
undoubted strong likeness of this young lady to your ladyship, which
is a positive fact for a jury; in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) having been brought up by Miss
Barbary; in Miss Barbary stating Miss Summerson's real name to be
Hawdon; in your ladyship's knowing both these names VERY WELL; and in
Hawdon's dying as he (<font color='blue'><b>ladyship</b></font>) did--to give your ladyship a family interest in
going further into the case, I will bring these papers here. I don't
know what they are, except that they are old letters: I have never
had them in my possession yet. I will bring those papers here as soon
as I get them and go over them for the first time with your ladyship.
I have told your ladyship my object. I have told your ladyship that I
should be placed in a very disagreeable situation if any complaint
was made, and all is in strict confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Is this the full purpose of the young man of the name of Guppy, or
has he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) any other? Do his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) words disclose the length, breadth, depth,
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) object and suspicion in coming here; or if not, what do they
hide? He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is a match for my Lady there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) may look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
can look at the table and keep that witness-box face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) from
telling anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may bring the letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady, <div class="bookquote">``if you choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship is not very encouraging, upon my word and honour,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, a little injured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may bring the letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) repeats in the same tone, <div class="bookquote">``if
you--please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be done. I wish your ladyship good day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On a table near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is a rich bauble of a casket, barred and clasped
like an old strong-chest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) still, takes it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
and unlocks it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I assure your ladyship I am not actuated by any motives of that
sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``and I couldn't accept anything of the kind. I
wish your ladyship good day, and am much obliged to you all the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>So the young man makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) bow and goes downstairs, where the
supercilious Mercury does not consider himself called upon to leave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) Olympus by the hall-fire to let the young man out.

<p/>As Sir Leicester basks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) library and dozes over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) newspaper,
is there no influence in the house to startle him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), not to say to make
the very trees at Chesney Wold fling up their knotted arms, the very
portraits frown, the very armour stir?

<p/>No. Words, sobs, and cries are but air, and air is so shut in and
shut out throughout the house in town that sounds need be uttered
trumpet-tongued indeed by my Lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) chamber to carry any faint
vibration to Sir Leicester's ears; and yet this cry is in the house,
going upward from a wild figure on its knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O my child, my child! Not dead in the first hours of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) life, as my
cruel sister told me, but sternly nurtured by her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), after she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had
renounced me and my name! O my child, O my child!''

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>Richard had been gone away some time when a visitor came to pass a

very kindly to me and was extremely confidential, so much so that
sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) almost made me uncomfortable. I had no right, I knew
very well, to be uncomfortable because she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) confided in me, and I felt
it was unreasonable; still, with all I could do, I could not quite
help it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) was such a sharp little lady and used to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) hands
folded in each other looking so very watchful while she (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) talked to me
that perhaps I found that rather irksome. Or perhaps it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) being
so upright and trim, though I don't think it was that, because I
thought that quaintly pleasant. Nor can it have been the general
expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Badger</b></font>) face, which was very sparkling and pretty for an
old lady. I don't know what it was. Or at least if I do now, I
thought I did not then. Or at least--but it don't matter.

<p/>Of a night when I was going upstairs to bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would invite me
into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat before the fire in a great chair;
and, dear me, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would tell me about Morgan ap-Kerrig until I
was quite low-spirited! Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) recited a few verses from
Crumlinwallinwer and the Mewlinnwillinwodd -LRB-if those are the right
names, which I dare say they are not-RRB-, and would become quite fiery
with the sentiments they expressed. Though I never knew what they
were -LRB-being in Welsh-RRB-, further than that they were highly eulogistic
of the lineage of Morgan ap-Kerrig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would say to me with stately triumph,
<div class="bookquote">``this, you see, is the fortune inherited by my son. Wherever my son
goes, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) can claim kindred with Ap-Kerrig. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) may not have money, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) always has what is much better--family, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I had my doubts of their caring so very much for Morgan ap-Kerrig in
India and China, but of course I never expressed them. I used to say
it was a great thing to be so highly connected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS, my dear, a great thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Woodcourt would reply. <div class="bookquote">``It has
its disadvantages; my son's choice of a wife, for instance, is
limited by it, but the matrimonial choice of the royal family is
limited in much the same manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would pat me on the arm and smooth my dress, as much as to
assure me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had a good opinion of me, the distance between us
notwithstanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mr. Woodcourt, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would say, and always with some
emotion, for with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) lofty pedigree she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had a very affectionate
heart, <div class="bookquote">``was descended from a great Highland family, the MacCoorts of
MacCoort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) served his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) king and country as an officer in the Royal
Highlanders, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) died on the field. My son is one of the last
representatives of two old families. With the blessing of heaven he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
will set them up again and unite them with another old family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in vain for me to try to change the subject, as I used to try,
only for the sake of novelty or perhaps because--but I need not be so
particular. Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) said one night, <div class="bookquote">``you have so much sense and you look
at the world in a quiet manner so superior to your time of life that
it is a comfort to me to talk to you about these family matters of
mine. You don't know much of my son, my dear; but you know enough of
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), I dare say, to recollect him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am. I recollect him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear. Now, my dear, I think you are a judge of character,
and I should like to have your opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that is so difficult!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it so difficult, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see it
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To give an opinion--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``On so slight an acquaintance, my dear. THAT<div class="bookquote">``S true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I didn't mean that, because Mr. Woodcourt had been at our house a
good deal altogether and had become quite intimate with my guardian.
I said so, and added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) seemed to be very clever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
profession--we thought--and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) kindness and gentleness to Miss
Flite were above all praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) justice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Woodcourt, pressing my hand. <div class="bookquote">``You
define him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) exactly. Allan is a dear fellow, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) profession
faultless. I say it, though I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) mother. Still, I must confess he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
is not without faults, love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None of us are,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! But his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) really are faults that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) might correct, and ought to
correct,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned the sharp old lady, sharply shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I
am so much attached to you that I may confide in you, my dear, as a
third party wholly disinterested, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) is fickleness itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I should have thought it hardly possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) could have
been otherwise than constant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) profession and zealous in the
pursuit of it, judging from the reputation he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had earned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right again, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the old lady retorted, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't
refer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) profession, look you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I refer, my dear, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) social conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) is
always paying trivial attentions to young ladies, and always has
been, ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was eighteen. Now, my dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) has never really
cared for any one of them and has never meant in doing this to do any
harm or to express anything but politeness and good nature. Still,
it's not right, you know; is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to wait for me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it might lead to mistaken notions, you see, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I supposed it might.

<p/>``Therefore, I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) many times that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) really should be more
careful, both in justice to himself and in justice to others. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
has always said, ``Mother, I will be; but you know me better than
anybody else does, and you know I mean no harm--in short, mean
nothing.<div class="bookquote">'' All of which is very true, my dear, but is no
justification. However, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is now gone so far away and for an
indefinite time, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) will have good opportunities and
introductions, we may consider this past and gone. And you, my dear,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, who was now all nods and smiles, <div class="bookquote">``regarding your
dear self, my love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady love</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, Mrs. Woodcourt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to be always selfish, talking of my son, who has gone to seek
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fortune and to find a wife--when do you mean to seek YOUR fortune
and to find a husband, Miss Summerson? Hey, look you! Now you blush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't think I did blush--at all events, it was not important if I
did--and I said my present fortune perfectly contented me and I had
no wish to change it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to
come for you, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Woodcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you believe you are a good prophet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then, it is that you will marry some one very rich and very
worthy, much older--five and twenty years, perhaps--than yourself.
And you will be an excellent wife, and much beloved, and very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a good fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``But why is it to be mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``there's suitability in it--you are so busy,
and so neat, and so peculiarly situated altogether that there's
suitability in it, and it will come to pass. And nobody, my love,
will congratulate you more sincerely on such a marriage than I
shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was curious that this should make me uncomfortable, but I think it
did. I know it did. It made me for some part of that night
uncomfortable. I was so ashamed of my folly that I did not like to
confess it even to Ada, and that made me more uncomfortable still. I
would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old
lady's confidence if I could have possibly declined it. It gave me
the most inconsistent opinions of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). At one time I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
a story-teller, and at another time that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the pink of truth.
Now I suspected that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very cunning, next moment I believed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
honest Welsh heart to be perfectly innocent and simple. And after
all, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me? Why could
not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), at least
as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless
things she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to me? Impelled towards her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as I certainly was, for
I was very anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should like me and was very glad indeed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did, why should I harp afterwards, with actual distress and
pain, on every word she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said and weigh it over and over again in
twenty scales? Why was it so worrying to me to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in our house,
and confidential to me every night, when I yet felt that it was
better and safer somehow that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should be there than anywhere else?
These were perplexities and contradictions that I could not account
for. At least, if I could--but I shall come to all that by and by,
and it is mere idleness to go on about it now.

<p/>So when Mrs. Woodcourt went away, I was sorry to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) but was
relieved too. And then Caddy Jellyby came down, and Caddy brought
such a packet of domestic news that it gave us abundant occupation.

<p/>First Caddy declared -LRB-and would at first declare nothing else-RRB- that I
was the best adviser that ever was known. This, my pet said, was no
news at all; and this, I said, of course, was nonsense. Then Caddy
told us that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was going to be married in a month and that if Ada
and I would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bridesmaids, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was the happiest girl in the
world. To be sure, this was news indeed; and I thought we never
should have done talking about it, we had so much to say to Caddy,
and Caddy had so much to say to us.

<p/>It seemed that Caddy's unfortunate papa had got over his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
bankruptcy--<div class="bookquote">``gone through the Gazette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caddy papa</b></font>)</div>was the expression Caddy
used, as if it were a tunnel--with the general clemency and
commiseration of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) creditors, and had got rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) affairs in
some blessed manner without succeeding in understanding them, and had
given up everything he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) possessed -LRB-which was not worth much, I should
think, to judge from the state of the furniture-RRB-, and had satisfied
every one concerned that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) could do no more, poor man. So, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had
been honourably dismissed to <div class="bookquote">``the office''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to begin the world again.
What he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did at the office, I never knew; Caddy said he (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) was a
<div class="bookquote">``custom-house and general agent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the only thing I ever
understood about that business was that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) wanted money more
than usual he (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) went to the docks to look for it, and hardly ever found
it.

<p/>As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) papa had tranquillized his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) mind by becoming this shorn
lamb, and they had removed to a furnished lodging in Hatton Garden
-LRB-where I found the children, when I afterwards went there, cutting
the horse hair out of the seats of the chairs and choking themselves
with it-RRB-, Caddy had brought about a meeting between him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatton</b></font>) and old Mr.
Turveydrop; and poor Mr. Jellyby, being very humble and meek, had
deferred to Mr. Turveydrop's deportment so submissively that they had
become excellent friends. By degrees, old Mr. Turveydrop, thus
familiarized with the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son's marriage, had worked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
parental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being
near at hand and had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) gracious consent to the young couple
commencing housekeeping at the academy in Newman Street when they
would.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your papa, Caddy. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Poor Pa,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, ``only cried and said he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) hoped we might get
on better than he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and Ma had got on. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) didn't say so before Prince,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) only said so to me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``My poor girl, you have not been
very well taught how to make a home for your husband, but unless you
mean with all your heart to strive to do it, you had better murder
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) than marry him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--if you really love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did you reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), Caddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it was very distressing, you know, to see poor Pa so low and
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) say such terrible things, and I couldn't help crying myself.
But I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that I DID mean it with all my heart and that I hoped
our house would be a place for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to come and find some comfort in
of an evening and that I hoped and thought I could be a better
daughter to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) there than at home. Then I mentioned Peepy's coming
to stay with me, and then Pa began to cry again and said the children
were Indians.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indians, Caddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``wild Indians. And Pa said'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--here she (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) began to
sob, poor girl, not at all like the happiest girl in the world--<div class="bookquote">``that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was sensible the best thing that could happen to them was their
being all tomahawked together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada suggested that it was comfortable to know that Mr. Jellyby did
not mean these destructive sentiments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course I know Pa wouldn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) family to be weltering in
their blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) means that they are very
unfortunate in being Ma's children and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is very unfortunate in
being Ma's husband; and I am sure that's true, though it seems
unnatural to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I asked Caddy if Mrs. Jellyby knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) wedding-day was fixed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! You know what Ma is, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``It's impossible to
say whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) knows it or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) has been told it often enough;
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) IS told it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) only gives me a placid look, as if I was
I don't know what--a steeple in the distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy with a
sudden idea; ``and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head and says ``Oh, Caddy,
Caddy, what a tease you are!<div class="bookquote">'' and goes on with the Borrioboola
letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And about your wardrobe, Caddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was under no
restraint with us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) returned, drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I must do the
best I can and trust to my dear Prince never to have an unkind
remembrance of my coming so shabbily to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). If the question
concerned an outfit for Borrioboola, Ma would know all about it and
would be quite excited. Being what it is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) neither knows nor
cares.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Caddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mother,
but mentioned this with tears as an undeniable fact, which I am
afraid it was. We were sorry for the poor dear girl and found so much
to admire in the good disposition which had survived under such
discouragement that we both at once -LRB-I mean Ada and I-RRB- proposed a
little scheme that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) perfectly joyful. This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) staying
with us for three weeks, my staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) for one, and our all
three contriving and cutting out, and repairing, and sewing, and
saving, and doing the very best we could think of to make the most of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) stock. My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was,
we took her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) home next day to arrange the matter and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) out
again in triumph with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) boxes and all the purchases that could be
squeezed out of a ten-pound note, which Mr. Jellyby had found in the
docks I suppose, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) at all events gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). What my
guardian would not have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) if we had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), it would
be difficult to say, but we thought it right to compound for no more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) wedding-dress and bonnet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) agreed to this compromise, and
if Caddy had ever been happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was happy when we sat
down to work.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was clumsy enough with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) needle, poor girl, and pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
fingers as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had been used to ink them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) could not help
reddening a little now and then, partly with the smart and partly
with vexation at being able to do no better, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) soon got over
that and began to improve rapidly. So day after day she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), and my
darling, and my little maid Charley, and a milliner out of the town,
and I, sat hard at work, as pleasantly as possible.

<p/>Over and above this, Caddy was very anxious <div class="bookquote">``to learn housekeeping,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said. Now, mercy upon us! The idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) learning
housekeeping of a person of my vast experience was such a joke that I
laughed, and coloured up, and fell into a comical confusion when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
proposed it. However, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Caddy, I am sure you are very welcome
to learn anything that you can learn of ME, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I showed
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) all my books and methods and all my fidgety ways. You would have
supposed that I was showing her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) some wonderful inventions, by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
study of them; and if you had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), whenever I jingled my
housekeeping keys, get up and attend me, certainly you might have
thought that there never was a greater imposter than I with a blinder
follower than Caddy Jellyby.

<p/>So what with working and housekeeping, and lessons to Charley, and
backgammon in the evening with my guardian, and duets with Ada, the
three weeks slipped fast away. Then I went home with Caddy to see
what could be done there, and Ada and Charley remained behind to take
care of my guardian.

<p/>When I say I went home with Caddy, I mean to the furnished lodging in
Hatton Garden. We went to Newman Street two or three times, where
preparations were in progress too--a good many, I observed, for
enhancing the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop, and a few for putting
the newly married couple away cheaply at the top of the house--but
our great point was to make the furnished lodging decent for the
wedding-breakfast and to imbue Mrs. Jellyby beforehand with some
faint sense of the occasion.

<p/>The latter was the more difficult thing of the two because Mrs.
Jellyby and an unwholesome boy occupied the front sitting-room -LRB-the
back one was a mere closet-RRB-, and it was littered down with
waste-paper and Borrioboolan documents, as an untidy stable might be
littered with straw. Mrs. Jellyby sat there all day drinking strong
coffee, dictating, and holding Borrioboolan interviews by
appointment. The unwholesome boy, who seemed to me to be going into a
decline, took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) meals out of the house. When Mr. Jellyby came home,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) usually groaned and went down into the kitchen. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) got
something to eat if the servant would give him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) anything, and then,
feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was in the way, went out and walked about Hatton
Garden in the wet. The poor children scrambled up and tumbled down
the house as they had always been accustomed to do.

<p/>The production of these devoted little sacrifices in any presentable
condition being quite out of the question at a week's notice, I
proposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could on
her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) marriage morning in the attic where they all slept, and should
confine our greatest efforts to her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) mama and her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) mama's room, and a
clean breakfast. In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of
attention, the lattice-work up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) back having widened considerably
since I first knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) hair looking like the mane of a
dustman's horse.

<p/>Thinking that the display of Caddy's wardrobe would be the best means
of approaching the subject, I invited Mrs. Jellyby to come and look
at it spread out on Caddy's bed in the evening after the unwholesome
boy was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) desk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
usual sweetness of temper, <div class="bookquote">``these are really ridiculous preparations,
though your assisting them is a proof of your kindness. There is
something so inexpressibly absurd to me in the idea of Caddy being
married! Oh, Caddy, you silly, silly, silly puss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) came upstairs with us notwithstanding and looked at the clothes
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) customary far-off manner. They suggested one distinct idea to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) placid smile, and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``My
good Miss Summerson, at half the cost, this weak child might have
been equipped for Africa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On our going downstairs again, Mrs. Jellyby asked me whether this
troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday. And on
my replying yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Will my room be required, my dear Miss
Summerson? For it's quite impossible that I can put my papers away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I took the liberty of saying that the room would certainly be wanted
and that I thought we must put the papers away somewhere. <div class="bookquote">``Well, my
dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby, <div class="bookquote">``you know best, I dare say.
But by obliging me to employ a boy, Caddy has embarrassed me to that
extent, overwhelmed as I am with public business, that I don't know
which way to turn. We have a Ramification meeting, too, on Wednesday
afternoon, and the inconvenience is very serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not likely to occur again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Caddy will be
married but once, probably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Jellyby replied; <div class="bookquote">``that's true, my dear. I suppose
we must make the best of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>The next question was how Mrs. Jellyby should be dressed on the
occasion. I thought it very curious to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) looking on serenely
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) writing-table while Caddy and I discussed it, occasionally
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head at us with a half-reproachful smile like a superior
spirit who could just bear with our trifling.

<p/>The state in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) dresses were, and the extraordinary confusion
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) kept them, added not a little to our difficulty; but at
length we devised something not very unlike what a common-place
mother might wear on such an occasion. The abstracted manner in which
Mrs. Jellyby would deliver herself up to having this attire tried on
by the dressmaker, and the sweetness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) would then
observe to me how sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was that I had not turned my thoughts to
Africa, were consistent with the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) behaviour.

<p/>The lodging was rather confined as to space, but I fancied that if
Mrs. Jellyby's household had been the only lodgers in Saint Paul's or
Saint Peter's, the sole advantage they would have found in the size
of the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to
be dirty in. I believe that nothing belonging to the family which it
had been possible to break was unbroken at the time of those
preparations for Caddy's marriage, that nothing which it had been
possible to spoil in any way was unspoilt, and that no domestic
object which was capable of collecting dirt, from a dear child's knee
to the door-plate, was without as much dirt as could well accumulate
upon it.

<p/>Poor Mr. Jellyby, who very seldom spoke and almost always sat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
was at home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head against the wall, became interested when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
saw that Caddy and I were attempting to establish some order among
all this waste and ruin and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) coat to help. But such
wonderful things came tumbling out of the closets when they were
opened--bits of mouldy pie, sour bottles, Mrs. Jellyby's caps,
letters, tea, forks, odd boots and shoes of children, firewood,
wafers, saucepan-lids, damp sugar in odds and ends of paper bags,
footstools, blacklead brushes, bread, Mrs. Jellyby's bonnets, books
with butter sticking to the binding, guttered candle ends put out
by being turned upside down in broken candlesticks, nutshells,
heads and tails of shrimps, dinner-mats, gloves, coffee-grounds,
umbrellas--that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked frightened, and left off again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came
regularly every evening and sat without his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) coat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) head
against the wall, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would have helped us if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had known
how.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Pa!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Caddy to me on the night before the great day, when
we really had got things a little to rights. <div class="bookquote">``It seems unkind to
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), Esther. But what could I do if I stayed! Since I first
knew you, I have tidied and tidied over and over again, but it's
useless. Ma and Africa, together, upset the whole house directly. We
never have a servant who don't drink. Ma's ruinous to everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jellyby could not hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) seemed very low
indeed and shed tears, I thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My heart aches for him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>); that it does!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``I can't help
thinking to-night, Esther, how dearly I hope to be happy with Prince,
and how dearly Pa hoped, I dare say, to be happy with Ma. What a
disappointed life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Caddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jellyby, looking slowly round from the
wail. It was the first time, I think, I ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) say three
words together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Pa!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried Caddy, going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) and embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
affectionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jellyby. <div class="bookquote">``Never have--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Prince, Pa?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>faltered Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``Not have Prince?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jellyby. <div class="bookquote">``Have him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), certainly. But, never
have--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I mentioned in my account of our first visit in Thavies Inn that
Richard described Mr. Jellyby as frequently opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mouth after
dinner without saying anything. It was a habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
mouth now a great many times and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head in a melancholy
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you wish me not to have? Don't have what, dear Pa?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>asked
Caddy, coaxing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never have a mission, my dear child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jellyby groaned and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head against the wall again, and
this was the only time I ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) make any approach to
expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) sentiments on the Borrioboolan question. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
had been more talkative and lively once, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) seemed to have been
completely exhausted long before I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>).

<p/>I thought Mrs. Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) papers and drinking coffee that night. It was twelve o'clock
before we could obtain possession of the room, and the clearance it
required then was so discouraging that Caddy, who was almost tired
out, sat down in the middle of the dust and cried. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) soon
cheered up, and we did wonders with it before we went to bed.

<p/>In the morning it looked, by the aid of a few flowers and a quantity
of soap and water and a little arrangement, quite gay. The plain
breakfast made a cheerful show, and Caddy was perfectly charming. But
when my darling came, I thought--and I think now--that I never had
seen such a dear face as my beautiful pet's.

<p/>We made a little feast for the children upstairs, and we put Peepy at
the head of the table, and we showed them Caddy in her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) bridal dress,
and they clapped their hands and hurrahed, and Caddy cried to think
that she (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) was going away from them and hugged them over and over again
until we brought Prince up to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) away--when, I am sorry to
say, Peepy bit him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop downstairs, in
a state of deportment not to be expressed, benignly blessing Caddy
and giving my guardian to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son's happiness was his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
own parental work and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) sacrificed personal considerations to
ensure it. <div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``these young people
will live with me; my house is large enough for their accommodation,
and they shall not want the shelter of my roof. I could have
wished--you will understand the allusion, Mr. Jarndyce, for you
remember my illustrious patron the Prince Regent--I could have
wished that my son had married into a family where there was more
deportment, but the will of heaven be done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. and Mrs. Pardiggle were of the party--Mr. Pardiggle, an
obstinate-looking man with a large waistcoat and stubbly hair, who
was always talking in a loud bass voice about his (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) mite, or Mrs.
Pardiggle's mite, or their five boys' mites. Mr. Quale, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) hair
brushed back as usual and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quale</b></font>) knobs of temples shining very much, was
also there, not in the character of a disappointed lover, but as the
accepted of a young--at least, an unmarried--lady, a Miss Wisk, who
was also there. Miss Wisk's mission, my guardian said, was to show
the world that woman's mission was man's mission and that the only
genuine mission of both man and woman was to be always moving
declaratory resolutions about things in general at public meetings.
The guests were few, but were, as one might expect at Mrs. Jellyby's,
all devoted to public objects only. Besides those I have mentioned,
there was an extremely dirty lady with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bonnet all awry and the
ticketed price of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress still sticking on it, whose neglected
home, Caddy told me, was like a filthy wilderness, but whose church
was like a fancy fair. A very contentious gentleman, who said it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mission to be everybody's brother but who appeared to be on terms
of coolness with the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) large family, completed the party.

<p/>A party, having less in common with such an occasion, could hardly
have been got together by any ingenuity. Such a mean mission as the
domestic mission was the very last thing to be endured among them;
indeed, Miss Wisk informed us, with great indignation, before we sat
down to breakfast, that the idea of woman's mission lying chiefly in
the narrow sphere of home was an outrageous slander on the part of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tyrant, man. One other singularity was that nobody with a
mission--except Mr. Quale, whose mission, as I think I have formerly
said, was to be in ecstasies with everybody's mission--cared at all
for anybody's mission. Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only
one infallible course was her (<font color='blue'><b>Pardiggle</b></font>) course of pouncing upon the poor and
applying benevolence to them like a strait-waistcoat; as Miss Wisk
was that the only practical thing for the world was the emancipation
of woman from the thraldom of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tyrant, man. Mrs. Jellyby, all the
while, sat smiling at the limited vision that could see anything but
Borrioboola-Gha.

<p/>But I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride
home instead of first marrying Caddy. We all went to church, and Mr.
Jellyby gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) away. Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) hat under his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) left arm -LRB-the inside presented at the clergyman
like a cannon-RRB- and his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) eyes creasing themselves up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) wig,
stood stiff and high-shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the
ceremony, and afterwards saluted us, I could never say enough to do
it justice. Miss Wisk, whom I cannot report as prepossessing in
appearance, and whose manner was grim, listened to the proceedings,
as part of woman's wrongs, with a disdainful face. Mrs. Jellyby, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) calm smile and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) bright eyes, looked the least concerned of all
the company.

<p/>We duly came back to breakfast, and Mrs. Jellyby sat at the head of
the table and Mr. Jellyby at the foot. Caddy had previously stolen
upstairs to hug the children again and tell them that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) name was
Turveydrop. But this piece of information, instead of being an
agreeable surprise to Peepy, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) back in such transports
of kicking grief that I could do nothing on being sent for but accede
to the proposal that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) should be admitted to the breakfast table. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) came down and sat in my lap; and Mrs. Jellyby, after saying, in
reference to the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) pinafore, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you naughty Peepy, what
a shocking little pig you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>was not at all discomposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) was
very good except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) brought down Noah with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) -LRB-out of an ark I
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) before we went to church-RRB- and WOULD dip him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head first
into the wine-glasses and then put him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>My guardian, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) sweet temper and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) quick perception and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
amiable face, made something agreeable even out of the ungenial
company. None of them seemed able to talk about anything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), or
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), own one subject, and none of them seemed able to talk about even
that as part of a world in which there was anything else; but my
guardian turned it all to the merry encouragement of Caddy and the
honour of the occasion, and brought us through the breakfast nobly.
What we should have done without him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), I am afraid to think, for all
the company despising the bride and bridegroom and old Mr.
Turveydrop--and old Mr. Thurveydrop, in virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) deportment,
considering himself vastly superior to all the company--it was a very
unpromising case.

<p/>At last the time came when poor Caddy was to go and when all her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
property was packed on the hired coach and pair that was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) husband to Gravesend. It affected us to see Caddy clinging,
then, to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) deplorable home and hanging on her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother's neck with
the greatest tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry I couldn't go on writing from dictation, Ma,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed
Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you forgive me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Caddy, Caddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jellyby. <div class="bookquote">``I have told you over and over
again that I have engaged a boy, and there's an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure you are not the least angry with me, Ma? Say you are
sure before I go away, Ma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You foolish Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Jellyby, <div class="bookquote">``do I look angry, or have
I inclination to be angry, or time to be angry? How CAN you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a little care of Pa while I am gone, Mama!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jellyby/Jellyby/JELLYBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy. <div class="bookquote">``You romantic child,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), lightly patting Caddy's back. <div class="bookquote">``Go along. I am excellent
friends with you. Now, good-bye, Caddy, and be very happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Caddy hung upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) father and nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cheek against hers as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were some poor dull child in pain. All this took place in the
hall. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) father released her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>), took out his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pocket handkerchief, and
sat down on the stairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head against the wall. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
found some consolation in walls. I almost think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did.

<p/>And then Prince took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and turned with great emotion and
respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father, whose deportment at that moment was
overwhelming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you over and over again, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>said Prince, kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
hand. <div class="bookquote">``I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration
regarding our marriage, and so, I can assure you, is Caddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``Ve-ry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``and dear daughter, I have done
my duty. If the spirit of a sainted wooman hovers above us and looks
down on the occasion, that, and your constant affection, will be my
recompense. You will not fail in YOUR duty, my son and daughter, I
believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear father, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>cried Prince.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, never, dear Mr. Turveydrop!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``is as it should be. My children, my
home is yours, my heart is yours, my all is yours. I will never leave
you; nothing but death shall part us. My dear son, you contemplate an
absence of a week, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A week, dear father. We shall return home this day week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop, <div class="bookquote">``let me, even under the present
exceptional circumstances, recommend strict punctuality. It is highly
important to keep the connexion together; and schools, if at all
neglected, are apt to take offence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This day week, father, we shall be sure to be home to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Turveydrop. <div class="bookquote">``You will find fires, my dear Caroline,
in your own room, and dinner prepared in my apartment. Yes, yes,
Prince!''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>anticipating some self-denying objection on his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) son's part
with a great air. <div class="bookquote">``You and our Caroline will be strange in the upper
part of the premises and will, therefore, dine that day in my
apartment. Now, bless ye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>They drove away, and whether I wondered most at Mrs. Jellyby or at
Mr. Turveydrop, I did not know. Ada and my guardian were in the same
condition when we came to talk it over. But before we drove away too,
I received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from Mr.
Jellyby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) came up to me in the hall, took both my hands, pressed
them earnestly, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) mouth twice. I was so sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
meaning that I said, quite flurried, <div class="bookquote">``You are very welcome, sir. Pray
don't mention it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope this marriage is for the best, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I when we
three were on our road home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it is, little woman. Patience. We shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the wind in the east to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ventured to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) laughed heartily and answered, <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it must have been this morning, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) answered <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>again, and this time my dear girl confidently
answered <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>too and shook the lovely head which, with its blooming
flowers against the golden hair, was like the very spring. <div class="bookquote">``Much YOU
know of east winds, my ugly darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in my
admiration--I couldn't help it.

<p/>Well! It was only their love for me, I know very well, and it is a
long time ago. I must write it even if I rub it out again, because it
gives me so much pleasure. They said there could be no east wind
where Somebody was; they said that wherever Dame Durden went, there
was sunshine and summer air.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI

<p/>Nurse and Patient


<p/>I had not been at home again many days when one evening I went
upstairs into my own room to take a peep over Charley's shoulder and
see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) was getting on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) copy-book. Writing was a trying
business to Charley, who seemed to have no natural power over a pen,
but in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated,
and to go wrong and crooked, and to stop, and splash, and sidle into
corners like a saddle-donkey. It was very odd to see what old letters
Charley's young hand had made, they so wrinkled, and shrivelled, and
tottering, it so plump and round. Yet Charley was uncommonly expert
at other things and had as nimble little fingers as I ever watched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, looking over a copy of the letter O in which
it was represented as square, triangular, pear-shaped, and collapsed
in all kinds of ways, <div class="bookquote">``we are improving. If we only get to make it
round, we shall be perfect, Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Then I made one, and Charley made one, and the pen wouldn't join
Charley's neatly, but twisted it up into a knot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Charley. We shall do it in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) pen, the copy being finished, opened and shut
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) cramped little hand, looked gravely at the page, half in pride
and half in doubt, and got up, and dropped me a curtsy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, miss. If you please, miss, did you know a poor person of
the name of Jenny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A brickmaker's wife, Charley? Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came and spoke to me when I was out a little while ago, and said
you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), miss. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked me if I wasn't the young lady's little
maid--meaning you for the young lady, miss--and I said yes, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had left this neighbourhood altogether, Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had, miss, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s come back again to where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to
live--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and Liz. Did you know another poor person of the name of
Liz, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do, Charley, though not by name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) said!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>returned Charley. <div class="bookquote">``They have both come back,
miss, and have been tramping high and low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tramping high and low, have they, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>If Charley could only have made the letters in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) copy
as round as the eyes with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) looked into my face, they would
have been excellent. <div class="bookquote">``And this poor person came about the house three
or four days, hoping to get a glimpse of you, miss--all she (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) wanted,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) said--but you were away. That was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) saw me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) saw me
a-going about, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley with a short laugh of the greatest
delight and pride, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) thought I looked like your maid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) though, really, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley. <div class="bookquote">``Really and truly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>And Charley, with
another short laugh of the purest glee, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) eyes very round
again and looked as serious as became my maid. I was never tired of
seeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity, standing
before me with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) youthful face and figure, and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) steady manner,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the
pleasantest way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>), Charley?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>My little maid's countenance fell as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``By the doctor's
shop, miss.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For Charley wore her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) black frock yet.

<p/>I asked if the brickmaker's wife were ill, but Charley said no. It
was some one else. Some one in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cottage who had tramped down to
Saint Albans and was tramping he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) didn't know where. A poor boy,
Charley said. No father, no mother, no any one. <div class="bookquote">``Like as Tom might
have been, miss, if Emma and me had died after father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley,
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) round eyes filling with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was getting medicine for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>returned Charley, <div class="bookquote">``how that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had once done as
much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>My little maid's face was so eager and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) quiet hands were folded so
closely in one another as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stood looking at me that I had no great
difficulty in reading her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``it
appears to me that you and I can do no better than go round to
Jenny's and see what's the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The alacrity with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil, and
having dressed me, quaintly pinned herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) warm shawl and
made herself look like a little old woman, sufficiently expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
readiness. So Charley and I, without saying anything to any one, went
out.

<p/>It was a cold, wild night, and the trees shuddered in the wind. The
rain had been thick and heavy all day, and with little intermission
for many days. None was falling just then, however. The sky had
partly cleared, but was very gloomy--even above us, where a few stars
were shining. In the north and north-west, where the sun had set
three hours before, there was a pale dead light both beautiful and
awful; and into it long sullen lines of cloud waved up like a sea
stricken immovable as it was heaving. Towards London a lurid glare
overhung the whole dark waste, and the contrast between these two
lights, and the fancy which the redder light engendered of an
unearthly fire, gleaming on all the unseen buildings of the city and
on all the faces of its many thousands of wondering inhabitants, was
as solemn as might be.

<p/>I had no thought that night--none, I am quite sure--of what was soon
to happen to me. But I have always remembered since that when we had
stopped at the garden-gate to look up at the sky, and when we went
upon our way, I had for a moment an undefinable impression of myself
as being something different from what I then was. I know it was then
and there that I had it. I have ever since connected the feeling with
that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and
time, to the distant voices in the town, the barking of a dog, and
the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill.

<p/>It was Saturday night, and most of the people belonging to the place
where we were going were drinking elsewhere. We found it quieter than
I had previously seen it, though quite as miserable. The kilns were
burning, and a stifling vapour set towards us with a pale-blue glare.

<p/>We came to the cottage, where there was a feeble candle in the
patched window. We tapped at the door and went in. The mother of the
little child who had died was sitting in a chair on one side of the
poor fire by the bed; and opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), a wretched boy, supported
by the chimney-piece, was cowering on the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) held under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
arm, like a little bundle, a fragment of a fur cap; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tried
to warm himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shook until the crazy door and window shook. The
place was closer than before and had an unhealthy and a very peculiar
smell.

<p/>I had not lifted my veil when I first spoke to the woman, which was
at the moment of our going in. The boy staggered up instantly and
stared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) action was so quick and my being the cause of it was so evident
that I stood still instead of advancing nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't go no more to the berryin ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>muttered the boy; <div class="bookquote">``I
ain't a-going there, so I tell you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>I lifted my veil and spoke to the woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said to me in a low
voice, <div class="bookquote">``Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), ma'am. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'ll soon come back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) head,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Jo, Jo, what's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know wot she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'s come for!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'s come to get me to go along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to the
berryin ground. I won't go to the berryin ground. I don't like the
name on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might go a-berryin ME.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shivering came on again,
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leaned against the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shook the hovel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) has been talking off and on about such like all day, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny/Will Jenny</b></font>)</div>said
Jenny softly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, how you stare! This is MY lady, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>returned the boy doubtfully, and surveying me with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm
held out above his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) burning eyes. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) looks to me the t`other one. It
ain't the bonnet, nor yet it ain't the gownd, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) looks to me the
t`other one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>My little Charley, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) premature experience of illness and
trouble, had pulled off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) bonnet and shawl and now went quietly up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) with a chair and sat him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) down in it like an old sick nurse.
Except that no such attendant could have shown him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) Charley's youthful
face, which seemed to engage his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. <div class="bookquote">``YOU tell me. Ain't the lady the t`other
lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley shook her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) methodically drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) rags about him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) as warm as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Then I s`pose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ain't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to see if I could do you any good,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``What is the
matter with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a-being froze,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>returned the boy hoarsely, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) haggard gaze
wandering about me, ``and then burnt up, and then froze, and then
burnt up, ever so many times in a hour. And my head's all sleepy, and
all a-going mad-like--and I'm so dry--and my bones isn't half so much
bones as pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This morning, ma'am, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at the corner of the town. I had
known him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up in London yonder. Hadn't I, Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom-all-Alone's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy replied.

<p/>Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) attention or his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, it was only for a very
little while. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soon began to droop his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head again, and roll it
heavily, and speak as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were half awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) come from London?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come from London yes`day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy himself, now flushed and
hot. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a-going somewheres.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) going?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somewheres,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>repeated the boy in a louder tone. <div class="bookquote">``I have been moved
on, and moved on, more nor ever I was afore, since the t`other one
give me the sov`ring. Mrs. Snagsby, she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)'s always a-watching, and
a-driving of me--what have I done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)?--and they're all a-watching
and a-driving of me. Every one of 'em's doing of it, from the time
when I don't get up, to the time when I don't go to bed. And I'm
a-going somewheres. That's where I'm a-going. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) told me, down in
Tom-all-Alone's, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) came from Stolbuns, and so I took the
Stolbuns Road. It's as good as another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always concluded by addressing Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to be done with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, taking the woman aside. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
could not travel in this state even if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had a purpose and knew
where he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was going!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know no more, ma'am, than the dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied, glancing
compassionately at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the dead know better, if they could
only tell us. I've kept him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) here all day for pity's sake, and I've
given him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) broth and physic, and Liz has gone to try if any one will
take him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in -LRB-here's my pretty in the bed--her (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) child, but I call it
mine-RRB-; but I can't keep him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) long, for if my husband was to come home
and find him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) here, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d be rough in putting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out and might do him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
a hurt. Hark! Here comes Liz back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The other woman came hurriedly in as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke, and the boy got up
with a half-obscured sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was expected to be going. When the
little child awoke, and when and how Charley got at it, took it out
of bed, and began to walk about hushing it, I don't know. There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was, doing all this in a quiet motherly manner as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were living
in Mrs. Blinder's attic with Tom and Emma again.

<p/>The friend had been here and there, and had been played about from
hand to hand, and had come back as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went. At first it was too
early for the boy to be received into the proper refuge, and at last
it was too late. One official sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to another, and the other sent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) back again to the first, and so backward and forward, until it
appeared to me as if both must have been appointed for their skill in
evading their duties instead of performing them. And now, after all,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, breathing quickly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been running and was
frightened too, <div class="bookquote">``Jenny, your master's on the road home, and mine's
not far behind, and the Lord help the boy, for we can do no more for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They put a few halfpence together and hurried them into his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>)
hand, and so, in an oblivious, half-thankful, half-insensible way, he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>)
shuffled out of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me the child, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said its mother to Charley, <div class="bookquote">``and thank
you kindly too! Jenny, woman dear, good night! Young lady, if my
master don't fall out with me, I'll look down by the kiln by and by,
where the boy will be most like, and again in the morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hurried off, and presently we passed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hushing and singing to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
child at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own door and looking anxiously along the road for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
drunken husband.

<p/>I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman, lest I should
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into trouble. But I said to Charley that we must not leave
the boy to die. Charley, who knew what to do much better than I did,
and whose quickness equalled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presence of mind, glided on before
me, and presently we came up with Jo, just short of the brick-kiln.

<p/>I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) must have begun his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) journey with some small bundle under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) arm and must have had it stolen or lost it. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) still carried
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) wretched fragment of fur cap like a bundle, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) went
bare-headed through the rain, which now fell fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) stopped when we
called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) and again showed a dread of me when I came up, standing
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) lustrous eyes fixed upon me, and even arrested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
shivering fit.

<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) to come with us, and we would take care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had some
shelter for the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want no shelter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I can lay amongst the warm
bricks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you know that people die there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>replied Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They dies everywheres,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. <div class="bookquote">``They dies in their
lodgings--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows where; I showed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--and they dies down in
Tom-all-Alone's in heaps. They dies more than they lives, according
to what I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hoarsely whispered Charley, <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ain't the
t`other one, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ain't the forrenner. Is there THREE of 'em then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley looked at me a little frightened. I felt half frightened at
myself when the boy glared on me so.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned and followed when I beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and finding that
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) acknowledged that influence in me, I led the way straight home. It
was not far, only at the summit of the hill. We passed but one man. I
doubted if we should have got home without assistance, the boy's
steps were so uncertain and tremulous. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made no complaint, however,
and was strangely unconcerned about himself, if I may say so strange
a thing.

<p/>Leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the hall for a moment, shrunk into the corner of the
window-seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be
called wonder at the comfort and brightness about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I went into
the drawing-room to speak to my guardian. There I found Mr. Skimpole,
who had come down by the coach, as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) frequently did without notice,
and never bringing any clothes with him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), but always borrowing
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) wanted.

<p/>They came out with me directly to look at the boy. The servants had
gathered in the hall too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shivered in the window-seat with
Charley standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), like some wounded animal that had been found
in a ditch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a sorrowful case,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian after asking him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a
question or two and touching him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and examining his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``What do you
say, Harold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Harold</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>inquired my guardian, almost sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``you know what I am: I am a
child. Be cross to me if I deserve it. But I have a constitutional
objection to this sort of thing. I always had, when I was a medical
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not safe, you know. There's a very bad sort of fever about
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Skimpole had retreated from the hall to the drawing-room again
and said this in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) airy way, seated on the music-stool as we stood
by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll say it's childish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Skimpole, looking gaily at
us. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I dare say it may be; but I AM a child, and I never
pretend to be anything else. If you put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out in the road, you only
put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was before. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be no worse off than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, you
know. Even make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better off, if you like. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sixpence, or
five shillings, or five pound ten--you are arithmeticians, and I am
not--and get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do then?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>asked my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) shoulders with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
engaging smile, <div class="bookquote">``I have not the least idea what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to do then. But
I have no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, is it not a horrible reflection,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, to whom I
had hastily explained the unavailing efforts of the two women, <div class="bookquote">``is it
not a horrible reflection,''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>walking up and down and rumpling his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
hair, <div class="bookquote">``that if this wretched creature were a convicted prisoner, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
hospital would be wide open to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would be as well taken
care of as any sick boy in the kingdom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole, ``you'll pardon the
simplicity of the question, coming as it does from a creature who is
perfectly simple in worldly matters, but why ISN<div class="bookquote">``T he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) a prisoner
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian stopped and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) with a whimsical mixture of
amusement and indignation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our young friend is not to be suspected of any delicacy, I should
imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, unabashed and candid. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me
that it would be wiser, as well as in a certain kind of way more
respectable, if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) showed some misdirected energy that got him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) into
prison. There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it, and
consequently more of a certain sort of poetry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) uneasy walk, <div class="bookquote">``that
there is not such another child on earth as yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. ``I dare say! But I confess I
don't see why our young friend, in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) degree, should not seek to
invest himself with such poetry as is open to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is no doubt
born with an appetite--probably, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is in a safer state of
health, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has an excellent appetite. Very well. At our young
friend's natural dinner hour, most likely about noon, our young
friend says in effect to society, ``I am hungry; will you have the
goodness to produce your spoon and feed me?'' Society, which has taken
upon itself the general arrangement of the whole system of spoons and
professes to have a spoon for our young friend, does NOT produce that
spoon; and our young friend, therefore, says ``You really must excuse
me if I seize it.<div class="bookquote">'' Now, this appears to me a case of misdirected
energy, which has a certain amount of reason in it and a certain
amount of romance; and I don't know but what I should be more
interested in our young friend, as an illustration of such a case,
than merely as a poor vagabond--which any one can be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the meantime,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ventured to observe, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is getting worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the meantime,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``as Miss Summerson,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) practical good sense, observes, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is getting worse.
Therefore I recommend your turning him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) out before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gets still
worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>The amiable face with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said it, I think I shall never forget.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman guardian state</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian, turning to me, <div class="bookquote">``I
can ensure his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) admission into the proper place by merely going there
to enforce it, though it's a bad state of things when, in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
condition, that is necessary. But it's growing late, and is a very
bad night, and the boy is worn out already. There is a bed in the
wholesome loft-room by the stable; we had better keep him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) there till
morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can be wrapped up and removed. We'll do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) hands upon the keys of the piano as
we moved away. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going back to our young friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I envy you your constitution, Jarndyce!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole
with playful admiration. <div class="bookquote">``You don't mind these things; neither does
Miss Summerson. You are ready at all times to go anywhere, and do
anything. Such is will! I have no will at all--and no won't--simply
can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my
guardian, looking back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) shoulder half angrily; only half
angrily, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an accountable
being.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jarndyce, I observed a bottle of cooling medicine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
pocket, and it's impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to do better than take it. You
can tell them to sprinkle a little vinegar about the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
sleeps and to keep it moderately cool and him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) moderately warm. But it
is mere impertinence in me to offer any recommendation. Miss
Summerson has such a knowledge of detail and such a capacity for the
administration of detail that she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) knows all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>We went back into the hall and explained to Jo what we proposed to
do, which Charley explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) again and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) received with
the languid unconcern I had already noticed, wearily looking on at
what was done as if it were for somebody else. The servants
compassionating his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) miserable state and being very anxious to help,
we soon got the loft-room ready; and some of the men about the house
carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) across the wet yard, well wrapped up. It was pleasant to
observe how kind they were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) and how there appeared to be a
general impression among them that frequently calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Old Chap''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was likely to revive his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) spirits. Charley directed the operations and
went to and fro between the loft-room and the house with such little
stimulants and comforts as we thought it safe to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>). My
guardian himself saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was left for the night and
reported to me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) returned to the growlery to write a letter on
the boy's behalf, which a messenger was charged to deliver at
day-light in the morning, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) seemed easier and inclined to
sleep. They had fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) door on the outside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said, in case of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) being delirious, but had so arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) could not make any
noise without being heard.

<p/>Ada being in our room with a cold, Mr. Skimpole was left alone all
this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic
airs and sometimes singing to them -LRB-as we heard at a distance-RRB- with
great expression and feeling. When we rejoined him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) in the
drawing-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would give us a little ballad which had come
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head <div class="bookquote">``apropos of our young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) sang one about a
peasant boy,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thrown on the wide world, doomed to wander and roam,
Bereft of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) parents, bereft of a home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a peasant boy</b></font>)</div><p/>quite exquisitely. It was a song that always made him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) cry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) told
us.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was extremely gay all the rest of the evening, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) absolutely
chirped--those were his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) delighted words--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) thought by what a
happy talent for business he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was surrounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) gave us, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) glass
of negus, <div class="bookquote">``Better health to our young friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and supposed and gaily
pursued the case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) being reserved like Whittington to become
Lord Mayor of London. In that event, no doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would establish the
Jarndyce Institution and the Summerson Almshouses, and a little
annual Corporation Pilgrimage to St. Albans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had no doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
said, that our young friend was an excellent boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way, but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
way was not the Harold Skimpole way; what Harold Skimpole was, Harold
Skimpole had found himself, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) considerable surprise, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
first made his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own acquaintance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had accepted himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
failings and had thought it sound philosophy to make the best of the
bargain; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) hoped we would do the same.

<p/>Charley's last report was that the boy was quiet. I could see, from
my window, the lantern they had left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) burning quietly; and I went
to bed very happy to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sheltered.

<p/>There was more movement and more talking than usual a little before
daybreak, and it awoke me. As I was dressing, I looked out of my
window and asked one of our men who had been among the active
sympathizers last night whether there was anything wrong about the
house. The lantern was still burning in the loft-window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the boy, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) worse?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/>``Gone, miss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead, miss? No. Gone clean off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At what time of the night he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had gone, or how, or why, it seemed
hopeless ever to divine. The door remaining as it had been left, and
the lantern standing in the window, it could only be supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
had got out by a trap in the floor which communicated with an empty
cart-house below. But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had shut it down again, if that were so; and
it looked as if it had not been raised. Nothing of any kind was
missing. On this fact being clearly ascertained, we all yielded to
the painful belief that delirium had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the night and
that, allured by some imaginary object or pursued by some imaginary
horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had strayed away in that worse than helpless state; all of
us, that is to say, but Mr. Skimpole, who repeatedly suggested, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) usual easy light style, that it had occurred to our young friend
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not a safe inmate, having a bad kind of fever upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had with great natural politeness taken himself off.

<p/>Every possible inquiry was made, and every place was searched. The
brick-kilns were examined, the cottages were visited, the two women
were particularly questioned, but they knew nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and
nobody could doubt that their wonder was genuine. The weather had for
some time been too wet and the night itself had been too wet to admit
of any tracing by footsteps. Hedge and ditch, and wall, and rick and
stack, were examined by our men for a long distance round, lest the
boy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead; but nothing
was seen to indicate that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had ever been near. From the time when
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was left in the loft-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vanished.

<p/>The search continued for five days. I do not mean that it ceased even
then, but that my attention was then diverted into a current very
memorable to me.

<p/>As Charley was at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) writing again in my room in the evening, and as
I sat opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at work, I felt the table tremble. Looking up,
I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``are you so cold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I am, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it is. I can't
hold myself still. I felt so yesterday at about this same time, miss.
Don't be uneasy, I think I'm ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I heard Ada's voice outside, and I hurried to the door of
communication between my room and our pretty sitting-room, and locked
it. Just in time, for she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) tapped at it while my hand was yet upon the
key.

<p/>Ada called to me to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) in, but I said, <div class="bookquote">``Not now, my dearest. Go
away. There's nothing the matter; I will come to you presently.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Ah!
It was a long, long time before my darling girl and I were companions
again.

<p/>Charley fell ill. In twelve hours she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very ill. I moved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to my
room, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in my bed, and sat down quietly to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). I
told my guardian all about it, and why I felt it was necessary that I
should seclude myself, and my reason for not seeing my darling above
all. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came very often to the door, and called to me, and
even reproached me with sobs and tears; but I wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) a long letter
saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) made me anxious and unhappy and imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
loved me and wished my mind to be at peace, to come no nearer than
the garden. After that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came beneath the window even oftener than
she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had come to the door, and if I had learnt to love her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) dear sweet
voice before when we were hardly ever apart, how did I learn to love
it then, when I stood behind the window-curtain listening and
replying, but not so much as looking out! How did I learn to love it
afterwards, when the harder time came!

<p/>They put a bed for me in our sitting-room; and by keeping the door
wide open, I turned the two rooms into one, now that Ada had vacated
that part of the house, and kept them always fresh and airy. There
was not a servant in or about the house but was so good that they
would all most gladly have come to me at any hour of the day or night
without the least fear or unwillingness, but I thought it best to
choose one worthy woman who was never to see Ada and whom I could
trust to come and go with all precaution. Through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) means I got out
to take the air with my guardian when there was no fear of meeting
Ada, and wanted for nothing in the way of attendance, any more than
in any other respect.

<p/>And thus poor Charley sickened and grew worse, and fell into heavy
danger of death, and lay severely ill for many a long round of day
and night. So patient she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was, so uncomplaining, and inspired by such
a gentle fortitude that very often as I sat by Charley holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
head in my arms--repose would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), so, when it would come to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) in no other attitude--I silently prayed to our Father in heaven
that I might not forget the lesson which this little sister taught
me.

<p/>I was very sorrowful to think that Charley's pretty looks would
change and be disfigured, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) recovered--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was such a child
with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dimpled face--but that thought was, for the greater part,
lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) greater peril. When she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was at the worst, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind
rambled again to the cares of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father's sick bed and the little
children, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) still knew me so far as that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would be quiet in my
arms when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could lie quiet nowhere else, and murmur out the
wanderings of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind less restlessly. At those times I used to
think, how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby
who had learned of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) faithful heart to be a mother to them in their
need was dead!

<p/>There were other times when Charley knew me well and talked to me,
telling me that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) love to Tom and Emma and that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
sure Tom would grow up to be a good man. At those times Charley would
speak to me of what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had read to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could
to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), of that young man carried out to be buried who was
the only son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a widow, of the ruler's
daughter raised up by the gracious hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bed of death. And
Charley told me that when her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father died she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had kneeled down and
prayed in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first sorrow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) likewise might be raised up and
given back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) poor children, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should never get
better and should die too, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought it likely that it might come
into Tom's mind to offer the same prayer for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Then would I show
Tom how these people of old days had been brought back to life on
earth, only that we might know our hope to be restored to heaven!

<p/>But of all the various times there were in Charley's illness, there
was not one when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lost the gentle qualities I have spoken of. And
there were many, many when I thought in the night of the last high
belief in the watching angel, and the last higher trust in God, on
the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) poor despised father.

<p/>And Charley did not die. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flutteringly and slowly turned the
dangerous point, after long lingering there, and then began to mend.
The hope that never had been given, from the first, of Charley being
in outward appearance Charley any more soon began to be encouraged;
and even that prospered, and I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) growing into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old childish
likeness again.

<p/>It was a great morning when I could tell Ada all this as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) stood
out in the garden; and it was a great evening when Charley and I at
last took tea together in the next room. But on that same evening, I
felt that I was stricken cold.

<p/>Happily for both of us, it was not until Charley was safe in bed
again and placidly asleep that I began to think the contagion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
illness was upon me. I had been able easily to hide what I felt at
tea-time, but I was past that already now, and I knew that I was
rapidly following in Charley's steps.

<p/>I was well enough, however, to be up early in the morning, and to
return my darling's cheerful blessing from the garden, and to talk
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) as long as usual. But I was not free from an impression that
I had been walking about the two rooms in the night, a little beside
myself, though knowing where I was; and I felt confused at
times--with a curious sense of fullness, as if I were becoming too
large altogether.

<p/>In the evening I was so much worse that I resolved to prepare
Charley, with which view I said, <div class="bookquote">``You're getting quite strong,
Charley, are you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, quite!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strong enough to be told a secret, I think, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite strong enough for that, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>cried Charley. But Charley's
face fell in the height of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) delight, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) saw the secret in MY
face; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) came out of the great chair, and fell upon my bosom,
and said <div class="bookquote">``Oh, miss, it's my doing! It's my doing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and a great deal
more out of the fullness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) grateful heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I after letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) go on for a little while,
<div class="bookquote">``if I am to be ill, my great trust, humanly speaking, is in you. And
unless you are as quiet and composed for me as you always were for
yourself, you can never fulfil it, Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll let me cry a little longer, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my
dear, my dear! If you'll only let me cry a little longer. Oh, my
dear!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--how affectionately and devotedly she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) poured this out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
clung to my neck, I never can remember without tears--<div class="bookquote">``I'll be good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>So I let Charley cry a little longer, and it did us both good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust in me now, if you please, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I am
listening to everything you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very little at present, Charley. I shall tell your doctor
to-night that I don't think I am well and that you are going to nurse
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>For that the poor child thanked me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) whole heart. <div class="bookquote">``And in the
morning, when you hear Miss Ada in the garden, if I should not be
quite able to go to the window-curtain as usual, do you go, Charley,
and say I am asleep--that I have rather tired myself, and am asleep.
At all times keep the room as I have kept it, Charley, and let no one
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley promised, and I lay down, for I was very heavy. I saw the
doctor that night and asked the favour of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) that I wished to ask
relative to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) saying nothing of my illness in the house as yet. I
have a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day,
and of day melting into night again; but I was just able on the first
morning to get to the window and speak to my darling.

<p/>On the second morning I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) dear voice--Oh, how dear
now!--outside; and I asked Charley, with some difficulty -LRB-speech
being painful to me-RRB-, to go and say I was asleep. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) answer
softly, <div class="bookquote">``Don't disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), Charley, for the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How does my own Pride look, Charley?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Disappointed, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley, peeping through the curtain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is very beautiful this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is indeed, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>answered Charley, peeping. <div class="bookquote">``Still looking up
at the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) blue clear eyes, God bless them, always loveliest when
raised like that!

<p/>I called Charley to me and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) last charge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Charley, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) knows I am ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) will try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) way
into the room. Keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) out, Charley, if you love me truly, to the
last! Charley, if you let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) in but once, only to look upon me for
one moment as I lie here, I shall die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never will! I never will!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) promised me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it, my dear Charley. And now come and sit beside me for a
little while, and touch me with your hand. For I cannot see you,
Charley; I am blind.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Lincoln</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXII

<p/>The Appointed Time


<p/>It is night in Lincoln's Inn--perplexed and troublous valley of the
shadow of the law, where suitors generally find but little day--and
fat candles are snuffed out in offices, and clerks have rattled down
the crazy wooden stairs and dispersed. The bell that rings at nine
o'clock has ceased its doleful clangour about nothing; the gates are
shut; and the night-porter, a solemn warder with a mighty power of
sleep, keeps guard in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) lodge. From tiers of staircase windows
clogged lamps like the eyes of Equity, bleared Argus with a
fathomless pocket for every eye and an eye upon it, dimly blink at
the stars. In dirty upper casements, here and there, hazy little
patches of candlelight reveal where some wise draughtsman and
conveyancer yet toils for the entanglement of real estate in meshes
of sheep-skin, in the average ratio of about a dozen of sheep to an
acre of land. Over which bee-like industry these benefactors of their
species linger yet, though office-hours be past, that they may give,
for every day, some good account at last.

<p/>In the neighbouring court, where the Lord Chancellor of the rag and
bottle shop dwells, there is a general tendency towards beer and
supper. Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins, whose respective sons, engaged
with a circle of acquaintance in the game of hide and seek, have been
lying in ambush about the by-ways of Chancery Lane for some hours and
scouring the plain of the same thoroughfare to the confusion of
passengers--Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins have but now exchanged
congratulations on the children being abed, and they still linger on
a door-step over a few parting words. Mr. Krook and his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) lodger, and
the fact of Mr. Krook's being <div class="bookquote">``continually in liquor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Krook/Mr. Krook</b></font>)</div>and the
testamentary prospects of the young man are, as usual, the staple of
their conversation. But they have something to say, likewise, of the
Harmonic Meeting at the Sol's Arms, where the sound of the piano
through the partly opened windows jingles out into the court, and
where Little Swills, after keeping the lovers of harmony in a roar
like a very Yorick, may now be heard taking the gruff line in a
concerted piece and sentimentally adjuring his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) friends and patrons to
<div class="bookquote">``Listen, listen, listen, tew the wa-ter fall!''  (<font color='red'><b>patrons</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Perkins and Mrs.
Piper compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of
professional celebrity who assists at the Harmonic Meetings and who
has a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window,
Mrs. Perkins possessing information that she (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) has been married a year
and a half, though announced as Miss M. Melvilleson, the noted siren,
and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Melvilleson</b></font>) baby is clandestinely conveyed to the Sol's Arms every
night to receive its natural nourishment during the entertainments.
<div class="bookquote">``Sooner than which, myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Perkins/Perkins</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Perkins, <div class="bookquote">``I would get my
living by selling lucifers.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Perkins/Perkins</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Piper, as in duty bound, is of the
same opinion, holding that a private station is better than public
applause, and thanking heaven for her (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) own -LRB-and, by implication, Mrs.
Perkins'-RRB- respectability. By this time the pot-boy of the Sol's Arms
appearing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) supper-pint well frothed, Mrs. Piper accepts that
tankard and retires indoors, first giving a fair good night to Mrs.
Perkins, who has had her (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) own pint in her (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) hand ever since it was
fetched from the same hostelry by young Perkins before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) was sent to
bed. Now there is a sound of putting up shop-shutters in the court
and a smell as of the smoking of pipes; and shooting stars are seen
in upper windows, further indicating retirement to rest. Now, too,
the policeman begins to push at doors; to try fastenings; to be
suspicious of bundles; and to administer his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) beat, on the hypothesis
that every one is either robbing or being robbed.

<p/>It is a close night, though the damp cold is searching too, and there
is a laggard mist a little way up in the air. It is a fine steaming
night to turn the slaughter-houses, the unwholesome trades, the
sewerage, bad water, and burial-grounds to account, and give the
registrar of deaths some extra business. It may be something in the
air--there is plenty in it--or it may be something in himself that is
in fault; but Mr. Weevle, otherwise Jobling, is very ill at ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>)
comes and goes between his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) own room and the open street door twenty
times an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) has been doing so ever since it fell dark. Since
the Chancellor shut up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) shop, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) did very early to-night,
Mr. Weevle has been down and up, and down and up -LRB-with a cheap tight
velvet skull-cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) head, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) whiskers look out of all
proportion-RRB-, oftener than before.

<p/>It is no phenomenon that Mr. Snagsby should be ill at ease too, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) always is so, more or less, under the oppressive influence of the
secret that is upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>). Impelled by the mystery of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is a
partaker and yet in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is not a sharer, Mr. Snagsby haunts what
seems to be its fountain-head--the rag and bottle shop in the court.
It has an irresistible attraction for him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>). Even now, coming round by
the Sol's Arms with the intention of passing down the court, and out
at the Chancery Lane end, and so terminating his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) unpremeditated
after-supper stroll of ten minutes' long from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) own door and back
again, Mr. Snagsby approaches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Mr. Weevle?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>says the stationer, stopping to speak. <div class="bookquote">``Are YOU
there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>says Weevle, <div class="bookquote">``Here I am, Mr. Snagsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>the stationer
inquires.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's not much air to be got here; and what there is, is not
very freshening,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Weevle answers, glancing up and down the court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, sir. Don't you observe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, pausing to
sniff and taste the air a little, <div class="bookquote">``don't you observe, Mr. Weevle,
that you're--not to put too fine a point upon it--that you're rather
greasy here, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I have noticed myself that there is a queer kind of flavour in
the place to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weevle rejoins. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's chops at the
Sol's Arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chops, do you think? Oh! Chops, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes
again. <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I suppose it is. But I should say their cook at
the Sol wanted a little looking after. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) has been burning 'em, sir!
And I don't think'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again and then
spits and wipes his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mouth--<div class="bookquote">``I don't think--not to put too fine a
point upon it--that they were quite fresh when they were shown the
gridiron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very likely. It's a tainting sort of weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS a tainting sort of weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``and I find it
sinking to the spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By George! I find it gives me the horrors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Weevle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, you see, you live in a lonesome way, and in a lonesome room,
with a black circumstance hanging over it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, looking
in past the other's shoulder along the dark passage and then falling
back a step to look up at the house. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't live in that room
alone, as you do, sir. I should get so fidgety and worried of an
evening, sometimes, that I should be driven to come to the door and
stand here sooner than sit there. But then it's very true that you
didn't see, in your room, what I saw there. That makes a difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know quite enough about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>returns Tony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not agreeable, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>pursues Mr. Snagsby, coughing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough
of mild persuasion behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Krook ought to consider it
in the rent. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) does, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Tony. <div class="bookquote">``But I doubt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You find the rent too high, do you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the stationer</b></font>)</div>returns the stationer.
<div class="bookquote">``Rents ARE high about here. I don't know how it is exactly, but the
law seems to put things up in price. Not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>adds Mr. Snagsby with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
apologetic cough, <div class="bookquote">``that I mean to say a word against the profession I
get my living by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weevle again glances up and down the court and then looks at the
stationer. Mr. Snagsby, blankly catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eye, looks upward for a
star or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
way out of this conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a curious fact, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) observes, slowly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hands,
<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) should have been--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>interrupts Mr. Weevle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The deceased, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, twitching his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head and
right eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) acquaintance on
the button.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returns the other as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) were not over-fond of
the subject. <div class="bookquote">``I thought we had done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only going to say it's a curious fact, sir, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) should
have come and lived here, and been one of my writers, and then that
you should come and live here, and be one of my writers too. Which
there is nothing derogatory, but far from it in the appellation,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, breaking off with a mistrust that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) may have
unpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorship in Mr. Weevle, <div class="bookquote">``because
I have known writers that have gone into brewers' houses and done
really very respectable indeed. Eminently respectable, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>adds Mr.
Snagsby with a misgiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has not improved the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a curious coincidence, as you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answers Weevle, once more
glancing up and down the court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seems a fate in it, don't there?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>suggests the stationer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>observes the stationer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) confirmatory cough. <div class="bookquote">``Quite
a fate in it. Quite a fate. Well, Mr. Weevle, I am afraid I must bid
you good night'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Snagsby speaks as if it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) desolate to go,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has been casting about for any means of escape ever since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) stopped to speak--<div class="bookquote">``my little woman will be looking for me else.
Good night, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If Mr. Snagsby hastens home to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) little woman the trouble of
looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) might set his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mind at rest on that score. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
little woman has had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) round the Sol's Arms all this
time and now glides after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, honouring Mr. Weevle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) doorway with a searching
glance as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes past.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll know me again, ma'am, at all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Weevle to
himself; <div class="bookquote">``and I can't compliment you on your appearance, whoever you
are, with your head tied up in a bundle. Is this fellow NEVER
coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div><p/>This fellow approaches as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) speaks. Mr. Weevle softly holds up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>)
finger, and draws him (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) into the passage, and closes the street door.
Then they go upstairs, Mr. Weevle heavily, and Mr. Guppy -LRB-for it is
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)-RRB- very lightly indeed. When they are shut into the back room, they
speak low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you had gone to Jericho at least instead of coming here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Tony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I said about ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said about ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>Tony repeats. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, so you did say about ten.
But according to my count, it's ten times ten--it's a hundred
o'clock. I never had such a night in my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has been the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Tony. ``Nothing has been the matter. But here have I
been stewing and fuming in this jolly old crib till I have had the
horrors falling on me as thick as hail. THERE<div class="bookquote">``S a blessed-looking
candle!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Tony, pointing to the heavily burning taper on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
table with a great cabbage head and a long winding-sheet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's easily improved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy observes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) takes the snuffers
in hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``IS it?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns friend</b></font>)</div>returns his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``Not so easily as you think. It has been
smouldering like that ever since it was lighted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter with you, Tony?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>inquires Mr. Guppy, looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), snuffers in hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) sits down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) elbow on the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``William Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replies the other, <div class="bookquote">``I am in the downs. It's this
unbearably dull, suicidal room--and old Boguey downstairs, I
suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weevle moodily pushes the snuffers-tray from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) elbow, leans his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) hand, puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) feet on the fender,
and looks at the fire. Mr. Guppy, observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), slightly tosses his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
head and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy
attitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't that Snagsby talking to you, Tony?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)--yes, it was Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weevle, altering the
construction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. No business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was only sauntering by and stopped to prose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``and thought it as well
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) shouldn't see me, so I waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There we go again, William G.!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>cried Tony, looking up for an
instant. <div class="bookquote">``So mysterious and secret! By George, if we were going to
commit a murder, we couldn't have more mystery about it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy affects to smile, and with the view of changing the
conversation, looks with an admiration, real or pretended, round the
room at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, terminating his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) survey
with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
is represented on a terrace, with a pedestal upon the terrace, and a
vase upon the pedestal, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shawl upon the vase, and a prodigious
piece of fur upon the shawl, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) arm on the prodigious piece of
fur, and a bracelet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very like Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``It's a speaking
likeness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>growls Tony, without changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) position. <div class="bookquote">``I
should have some fashionable conversation, here, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Finding by this time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) friend is not to be wheedled into a
more sociable humour, Mr. Guppy puts about upon the ill-used tack and
remonstrates with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I can make allowances for lowness of spirits, for
no man knows what it is when it does come upon a man better than I
do, and no man perhaps has a better right to know it than a man who
has an unrequited image imprinted on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) `eart. But there are bounds
to these things when an unoffending party is in question, and I will
acknowledge to you, Tony, that I don't think your manner on the
present occasion is hospitable or quite gentlemanly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is strong language, William Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Weevle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, it may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>retorts Mr. William Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``but I feel strongly
when I use it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weevle admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) has been wrong and begs Mr. William Guppy
to think no more about it. Mr. William Guppy, however, having got the
advantage, cannot quite release it without a little more injured
remonstrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Dash it, Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>says that gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``you really ought to be

yourself all that is calculated to charm the eye and allure the
taste. It is not--happily for you, perhaps, and I may wish that I
could say the same--it is not your character to hover around one
flower. The ole garden is open to you, and your airy pinions carry
you through it. Still, Tony, far be it from me, I am sure, to wound
even your feelings without a cause!''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Tony again entreats that the subject may be no longer pursued, saying
emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``William Guppy, drop it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy acquiesces, with
the reply, <div class="bookquote">``I never should have taken it up, Tony, of my own accord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Tony, stirring the fire, <div class="bookquote">``touching this same bundle
of letters. Isn't it an extraordinary thing of Krook to have
appointed twelve o'clock to-night to hand 'em over to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) do it for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) do anything for? HE (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) don't know. Said to-day was his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
birthday and he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)'d hand 'em over to-night at twelve o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)'ll

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgotten? Trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) for that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) never forgets anything. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
to-night, about eight--helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) to shut up his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) shop--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) had got
the letters then in his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) hairy cap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) pulled it off and showed 'em
me. When the shop was closed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) took them out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) cap, hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>)
cap on the chair-back, and stood turning them over before the fire. I
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) a little while afterwards, through the floor here, humming
like the wind, the only song he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) knows--about Bibo, and old Charon,
and Bibo being drunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) died, or something or other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) has been
as quiet since as an old rat asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) hole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy after considering a little with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) legs
crossed, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) can't read yet, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Read! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)'ll never read. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) can make all the letters separately, and

that much, under me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) can't put them together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)'s too old to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, uncrossing and recrossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) legs, <div class="bookquote">``how do

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) never spelt it out. You know what a curious power of eye he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) has
and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) has been used to employ himself in copying things by eye
alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) imitated it, evidently from the direction of a letter, and
asked me what it meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, uncrossing and recrossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) legs again,

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>``A woman's. Fifty to one a lady's--slopes a good deal, and the end of
the letter ``n,<div class="bookquote">'' long and hasty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy has been biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) thumb-nail during this dialogue,
generally changing the thumb when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has changed the cross leg. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
is going to do so again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) happens to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) coat-sleeve. It
takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) stares at it, aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Tony, what on earth is going on in this house to-night? Is
there a chimney on fire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chimney on fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``See how the soot's falling. See here, on my
arm! See again, on the table here! Confound the stuff, it won't blow
off--smears like black fat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>They look at one another, and Tony goes listening to the door, and a
little way upstairs, and a little way downstairs. Comes back and says
it's all right and all quiet, and quotes the remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) lately made to
Mr. Snagsby about their cooking chops at the Sol's Arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it was then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>resumes Mr. Guppy, still glancing with remarkable
aversion at the coat-sleeve, as they pursue their conversation before
the fire, leaning on opposite sides of the table, with their heads
very near together, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) told you of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) having taken the bundle
of letters from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) lodger's portmanteau?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the time, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>answers Tony, faintly adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
whiskers. <div class="bookquote">``Whereupon I wrote a line to my dear boy, the Honourable
William Guppy, informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) of the appointment for to-night and
advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) not to call before, Boguey being a slyboots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div><p/>The light vivacious tone of fashionable life which is usually assumed
by Mr. Weevle sits so ill upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) to-night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) abandons that and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) whiskers together, and after looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) shoulder, appears
to yield himself up a prey to the horrors again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to bring the letters to your room to read and compare, and
to get yourself into a position to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) all about them. That's
the arrangement, isn't it, Tony?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Guppy, anxiously biting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) thumb-nail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't speak too low. Yes. That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) and I agreed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what, Tony--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't speak too low,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Tony once more. Mr. Guppy nods his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
sagacious head, advances it yet closer, and drops into a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what. The first thing to be done is to make another
packet like the real one so that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) should ask to see the real one
while it's in my possession, you can show him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) the dummy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) detects the dummy as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) sees it, which with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) biting screw of an eye is about five hundred times more likely
than not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>suggests Tony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'll face it out. They don't belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), and they never
did. You found that, and you placed them in my hands--a legal friend
of yours--for security. If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) forces us to it, they'll be producible,
won't they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>is Mr. Weevle's reluctant admission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>remonstrates his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">``how you look! You don't doubt

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suspect anything more than I know, William,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns the
other gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>urges Mr. Guppy, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) voice a little;
but on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend's once more warning him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I tell you, you can't
speak too low,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) repeats his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) question without any sound at all,
forming with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) lips only the words, <div class="bookquote">``What do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know three things. First, I know that here we are whispering in
secrecy, a pair of conspirators.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``And we had better be that than a pair of
noodles, which we should be if we were doing anything else, for it's
the only way of doing what we want to do. Secondly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Secondly, it's not made out to me how it's likely to be profitable,
after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy casts up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) eyes at the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the
mantelshelf and replies, <div class="bookquote">``Tony, you are asked to leave that to the
honour of your friend. Besides its being calculated to serve that
friend in those chords of the human mind which--which need not be
called into agonizing vibration on the present occasion--your friend
is no fool. What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of Saint Paul's. Listen and
you'll hear all the bells in the city jangling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Both sit silent, listening to the metal voices, near and distant,
resounding from towers of various heights, in tones more various than
their situations. When these at length cease, all seems more
mysterious and quiet than before. One disagreeable result of
whispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence,
haunted by the ghosts of sound--strange cracks and tickings, the
rustling of garments that have no substance in them, and the tread of
dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea-sand or the winter
snow. So sensitive the two friends happen to be that the air is full
of these phantoms, and the two look over their shoulders by one
consent to see that the door is shut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Tony?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, drawing nearer to the fire and biting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) unsteady thumb-nail. <div class="bookquote">``You were going to say, thirdly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's far from a pleasant thing to be plotting about a dead man in
the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died, especially when you happen to live in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we are plotting nothing against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Tony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May be not, still I don't like it. Live here by yourself and see how
YOU like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to dead men, Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>proceeds Mr. Guppy, evading this proposal,
<div class="bookquote">``there have been dead men in most rooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know there have, but in most rooms you let them alone, and--and
they let you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>Tony answers.

<p/>The two look at each other again. Mr. Guppy makes a hurried remark to
the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
hopes so. There is an oppressive blank until Mr. Weevle, by stirring
the fire suddenly, makes Mr. Guppy start as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) heart had been
stirred instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fah! Here's more of this hateful soot hanging about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let
us open the window a bit and get a mouthful of air. It's too close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) raises the sash, and they both rest on the window-sill, half in
and half out of the room. The neighbouring houses are too near to
admit of their seeing any sky without craning their necks and looking
up, but lights in frowsy windows here and there, and the rolling of
distant carriages, and the new expression that there is of the stir
of men, they find to be comfortable. Mr. Guppy, noiselessly tapping
on the window-sill, resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) whispering in quite a light-comedy
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the by, Tony, don't forget old Smallweed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>meaning the younger of
that name. <div class="bookquote">``I have not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) into this, you know. That grandfather
of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) is too keen by half. It runs in the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Tony. <div class="bookquote">``I am up to all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as to Krook,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>resumes Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Now, do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) really
has got hold of any other papers of importance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) has boasted to
you, since you have been such allies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Tony shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Can't Imagine. If we get through
this business without rousing his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) suspicions, I shall be better
informed, no doubt. How can I know without seeing them, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) don't
know himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is always spelling out words from them, and chalking
them over the table and the shop-wall, and asking what this is and
what that is; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) whole stock from beginning to end may easily be
the waste-paper he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) bought it as, for anything I can say. It's a
monomania with him (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) is possessed of documents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) has been
going to learn to read them this last quarter of a century, I should
judge, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) tells me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) first come by that idea, though? That's the question,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy suggests with one eye shut, after a little forensic
meditation. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) may have found papers in something he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) bought, where
papers were not supposed to be, and may have got it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) shrewd
head from the manner and place of their concealment that they are
worth something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) may have been taken in, in some pretended bargain. Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) may
have been muddled altogether by long staring at whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) HAS got,
and by drink, and by hanging about the Lord Chancellor's Court and
hearing of documents for ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Weevle.

<p/>Mr. Guppy sitting on the window-sill, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) head and balancing
all these possibilities in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mind, continues thoughtfully to tap
it, and clasp it, and measure it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hand, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hastily
draws his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hand away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, in the devil's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``is this! Look at my fingers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A thick, yellow liquor defiles them, which is offensive to the touch
and sight and more offensive to the smell. A stagnant, sickening oil
with some natural repulsion in it that makes them both shudder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing here? What have you been pouring out of
window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I pouring out of window! Nothing, I swear! Never, since I have been
here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lodger</b></font>)</div>cries the lodger.

<p/>And yet look here--and look here! When he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) brings the candle here,
from the corner of the window-sill, it slowly drips and creeps away
down the bricks, here lies in a little thick nauseous pool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a horrible house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, shutting down the window.
<div class="bookquote">``Give me some water or I shall cut my hand off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) so washes, and rubs, and scrubs, and smells, and washes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
has not long restored himself with a glass of brandy and stood
silently before the fire when Saint Paul's bell strikes twelve and
all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various
heights in the dark air, and in their many tones. When all is quiet
again, the lodger says, <div class="bookquote">``It's the appointed time at last. Shall I
go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lodger</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy nods and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``lucky touch''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>on the back, but not
with the washed hand, though it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) right hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) goes downstairs, and Mr. Guppy tries to compose himself before the
fire for waiting a long time. But in no more than a minute or two the
stairs creak and Tony comes swiftly back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Got them! No. The old man's not there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) has been so horribly frightened in the short interval that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
terror seizes the other, who makes a rush at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) and asks loudly,
<div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hear, and I softly opened the door and looked
in. And the burning smell is there--and the soot is there, and the
oil is there--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>Tony ends this with a groan.

<p/>Mr. Guppy takes the light. They go down, more dead than alive, and
holding one another, push open the door of the back shop. The cat has
retreated close to it and stands snarling, not at them, at something
on the ground before the fire. There is a very little fire left in
the grate, but there is a smouldering, suffocating vapour in the room
and a dark, greasy coating on the walls and ceiling. The chairs and
table, and the bottle so rarely absent from the table, all stand as
usual. On one chair-back hang the old man's hairy cap and coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>whispers the lodger</b></font>)</div>whispers the lodger, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend's attention to these
objects with a trembling finger. <div class="bookquote">``I told you so. When I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap off, took out the little bundle of old letters, hung
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap on the back of the chair--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat was there already, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had pulled that off before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to put the shutters up--and I left
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turning the letters over in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, standing just where that
crumbled black thing is upon the floor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hanging somewhere? They look up. No.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>whispers Tony. <div class="bookquote">``At the foot of the same chair there lies a
dirty bit of thin red cord that they tie up pens with. That went
round the letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) undid it slowly, leering and laughing at me,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to turn them over, and threw it there. I saw it
fall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with the cat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mad, I think. And no wonder in this evil place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They advance slowly, looking at all these things. The cat remains
where they found her (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), still snarling at the something on the ground
before the fire and between the two chairs. What is it? Hold up the
light.

<p/>Here is a small burnt patch of flooring; here is the tinder from a
little bundle of burnt paper, but not so light as usual, seeming to
be steeped in something; and here is--is it the cinder of a small
charred and broken log of wood sprinkled with white ashes, or is it
coal? Oh, horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) IS here! And this from which we run away,
striking out the light and overturning one another into the street,
is all that represents him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>).

<p/>Help, help, help! Come into this house for heaven's sake! Plenty will
come in, but none can help. The Lord Chancellor of that court, true
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) title in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) last act, has died the death of all lord
chancellors in all courts and of all authorities in all places under
all names soever, where false pretences are made, and where injustice
is done. Call the death by any name your Highness will, attribute
it to whom you will, or say it might have been prevented how you
will, it is the same death eternally--inborn, inbred, engendered
in the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself, and that
only--spontaneous combustion, and none other of all the deaths that
can be died.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII

<p/>Interlopers


<p/>Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons
who attended the last coroner's inquest at the Sol's Arms reappear in
the precincts with surprising swiftness -LRB-being, in fact, breathlessly
fetched by the active and intelligent beadle-RRB-, and institute
perquisitions through the court, and dive into the Sol's parlour, and
write with ravenous little pens on tissue-paper. Now do they note
down, in the watches of the night, how the neighbourhood of Chancery
Lane was yesterday, at about midnight, thrown into a state of the
most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and
horrible discovery. Now do they set forth how it will doubtless be
remembered that some time back a painful sensation was created in the
public mind by a case of mysterious death from opium occurring in the
first floor of the house occupied as a rag, bottle, and general
marine store shop, by an eccentric individual of intemperate habits,
far advanced in life, named Krook; and how, by a remarkable
coincidence, Krook was examined at the inquest, which it may be
recollected was held on that occasion at the Sol's Arms, a
well-conducted tavern immediately adjoining the premises in question
on the west side and licensed to a highly respectable landlord, Mr.
James George Bogsby. Now do they show -LRB-in as many words as possible-RRB-
how during some hours of yesterday evening a very peculiar smell was
observed by the inhabitants of the court, in which the tragical
occurrence which forms the subject of that present account
transpired; and which odour was at one time so powerful that Mr.
Swills, a comic vocalist professionally engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby,
has himself stated to our reporter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogsby</b></font>) mentioned to Miss M.
Melvilleson, a lady of some pretensions to musical ability, likewise
engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby to sing at a series of concerts called
Harmonic Assemblies, or Meetings, which it would appear are held at
the Sol's Arms under Mr. Bogsby's direction pursuant to the Act of
George the Second, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Swills-RRB- found his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) voice seriously
affected by the impure state of the atmosphere, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) jocose expression
at the time being that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was like an empty post-office, for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
hadn't a single note in him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). How this account of Mr. Swills is
entirely corroborated by two intelligent married females residing in
the same court and known respectively by the names of Mrs. Piper and
Mrs. Perkins, both of whom observed the foetid effluvia and regarded
them as being emitted from the premises in the occupation of Krook,
the unfortunate deceased. All this and a great deal more the two
gentlemen who have formed an amicable partnership in the melancholy
catastrophe write down on the spot; and the boy population of the
court -LRB-out of bed in a moment-RRB- swarm up the shutters of the Sol's
Arms parlour, to behold the tops of their heads while they are about
it.

<p/>The whole court, adult as well as boy, is sleepless for that night,
and can do nothing but wrap up its many heads, and talk of the
ill-fated house, and look at it. Miss Flite has been bravely rescued
from her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) chamber, as if it were in flames, and accommodated with a
bed at the Sol's Arms. The Sol neither turns off its gas nor shuts
its door all night, for any kind of public excitement makes good for
the Sol and causes the court to stand in need of comfort. The house
has not done so much in the stomachic article of cloves or in
brandy-and-water warm since the inquest. The moment the pot-boy heard
what had happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) rolled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) shirt-sleeves tight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>)
shoulders and said, <div class="bookquote">``There'll be a run upon us!''  (<font color='red'><b>shirt-sleeves</b></font>)</div>In the first outcry,
young Piper dashed off for the fire-engines and returned in triumph
at a jolting gallop perched up aloft on the Phoenix and holding on to
that fabulous creature with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) might in the midst of helmets and
torches. One helmet remains behind after careful investigation of all
chinks and crannies and slowly paces up and down before the house in
company with one of the two policemen who have likewise been left in
charge thereof. To this trio everybody in the court possessed of
sixpence has an insatiate desire to exhibit hospitality in a liquid
form.

<p/>Mr. Weevle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) friend Mr. Guppy are within the bar at the Sol and
are worth anything to the Sol that the bar contains if they will only
stay there. <div class="bookquote">``This is not a time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bogsby/Mr. J. G. Bogsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bogsby, <div class="bookquote">``to haggle about
money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bogsby/Mr. J. G. Bogsby</b></font>)</div>though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogsby</b></font>) looks something sharply after it, over the counter;
<div class="bookquote">``give your orders, you two gentlemen, and you're welcome to whatever
you put a name to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus entreated, the two gentlemen -LRB-Mr. Weevle especially-RRB- put names
to so many things that in course of time they find it difficult to
put a name to anything quite distinctly, though they still relate to
all new-comers some version of the night they have had of it, and of
what they said, and what they thought, and what they saw. Meanwhile,
one or other of the policemen often flits about the door, and pushing
it open a little way at the full length of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) arm, looks in from
outer gloom. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) has any suspicions, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) may as well
know what they are up to in there.

<p/>Thus night pursues its leaden course, finding the court still out of
bed through the unwonted hours, still treating and being treated,
still conducting itself similarly to a court that has had a little
money left it unexpectedly. Thus night at length with slow-retreating
steps departs, and the lamp-lighter going his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) rounds, like an
executioner to a despotic king, strikes off the little heads of fire
that have aspired to lessen the darkness. Thus the day cometh,
whether or no.

<p/>And the day may discern, even with its dim London eye, that the court
has been up all night. Over and above the faces that have fallen
drowsily on tables and the heels that lie prone on hard floors
instead of beds, the brick and mortar physiognomy of the very court
itself looks worn and jaded. And now the neighbourhood, waking up and
beginning to hear of what has happened, comes streaming in, half
dressed, to ask questions; and the two policemen and the helmet -LRB-who
are far less impressible externally than the court-RRB- have enough to do
to keep the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious, gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, coming up. <div class="bookquote">``What's this
I hear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policemen</b></font>)</div>returns one of the policemen. <div class="bookquote">``That's what it is.
Now move on here, come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, good gracious, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, somewhat promptly
backed away, <div class="bookquote">``I was at this door last night betwixt ten and eleven
o'clock in conversation with the young man who lodges here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the policeman</b></font>)</div>returns the policeman. <div class="bookquote">``You will find the young man next
door then. Now move on here, some of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not hurt, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurt? No. What's to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurt</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby, wholly unable to answer this or any question in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
troubled mind, repairs to the Sol's Arms and finds Mr. Weevle
languishing over tea and toast with a considerable expression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>)
of exhausted excitement and exhausted tobacco-smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Guppy likewise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>quoth Mr. Snagsby. <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, dear! What
a fate there seems in all this! And my lit--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby's power of speech deserts him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) in the formation of the
words <div class="bookquote">``my little woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>For to see that injured female walk into the
Sol's Arms at that hour of the morning and stand before the
beer-engine, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) like an accusing spirit,
strikes him (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) dumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby when his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) tongue is loosened, <div class="bookquote">``will you
take anything? A little--not to put too fine a point upon it--drop of
shrub?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, you know these two gentlemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Snagsby, and in a rigid manner acknowledges their
presence, still fixing Mr. Snagsby with her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eye.

<p/>The devoted Mr. Snagsby cannot bear this treatment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) takes Mrs.
Snagsby by the hand and leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) aside to an adjacent cask.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little woman, why do you look at me in that way? Pray don't do
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help my looks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Snagsby, <div class="bookquote">``and if I could I
wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of meekness, rejoins, <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you
really, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>and meditates. Then coughs his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of trouble and
says, <div class="bookquote">``This is a dreadful mystery, my love!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>still fearfully
disconcerted by Mrs. Snagsby's eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>returns Mrs. Snagsby, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``a dreadful
mystery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>urges Mr. Snagsby in a piteous manner, <div class="bookquote">``don't for
goodness' sake speak to me with that bitter expression and look at me
in that searching way! I beg and entreat of you not to do it. Good
Lord, you don't suppose that I would go spontaneously combusting any
person, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>returns Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/>On a hasty review of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) unfortunate position, Mr. Snagsby <div class="bookquote">``can't
say''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is not prepared positively to deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) may have
had something to do with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has had something--he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) don't know
what--to do with so much in this connexion that is mysterious that it
is possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) may even be implicated, without knowing it, in the
present transaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) faintly wipes his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
handkerchief and gasps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>says the unhappy stationer, <div class="bookquote">``would you have any objections
to mention why, being in general so delicately circumspect in your
conduct, you come into a wine-vaults before breakfast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do YOU come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>inquires Mrs. Snagsby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, merely to know the rights of the fatal accident which has
happened to the venerable party who has been--combusted.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby
has made a pause to suppress a groan. <div class="bookquote">``I should then have related
them to you, my love, over your French roll.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you would! You relate everything to me, Mr. Snagsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every--my lit--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Snagsby after contemplating his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
increased confusion with a severe and sinister smile, <div class="bookquote">``if you would
come home with me; I think you may be safer there, Mr. Snagsby, than
anywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, I don't know but what I may be, I am sure. I am ready to
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby casts his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eye forlornly round the bar, gives Messrs.
Weevle and Guppy good morning, assures them of the satisfaction with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) sees them uninjured, and accompanies Mrs. Snagsby from the
Sol's Arms. Before night his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) may not be responsible
for some inconceivable part in the catastrophe which is the talk of
the whole neighbourhood is almost resolved into certainty by Mrs.
Snagsby's pertinacity in that fixed gaze. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) mental sufferings are
so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) entertains wandering ideas of delivering himself up
to justice and requiring to be cleared if innocent and punished with
the utmost rigour of the law if guilty.

<p/>Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy, having taken their breakfast, step into
Lincoln's Inn to take a little walk about the square and clear as
many of the dark cobwebs out of their brains as a little walk may.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no more favourable time than the present, Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says
Mr. Guppy after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the
square, <div class="bookquote">``for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must,
with very little delay, come to an understanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I tell you what, William G.!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>returns the other, eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
companion with a bloodshot eye. <div class="bookquote">``If it's a point of conspiracy, you
needn't take the trouble to mention it. I have had enough of that,
and I ain't going to have any more. We shall have YOU taking fire
next or blowing up with a bang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>This supposititious phenomenon is so very disagreeable to Mr. Guppy
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) voice quakes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) says in a moral way, <div class="bookquote">``Tony, I should have
thought that what we went through last night would have been a lesson
to you never to be personal any more as long as you lived.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which
Mr. Weevle returns, <div class="bookquote">``William, I should have thought it would have
been a lesson to YOU never to conspire any more as long as you
lived.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>To which Mr. Guppy says, <div class="bookquote">``Who's conspiring?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>To which Mr.
Jobling replies, <div class="bookquote">``Why, YOU are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>To which Mr. Guppy retorts, <div class="bookquote">``No, I
am not.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>To which Mr. Jobling retorts again, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>To which
Mr. Guppy retorts, <div class="bookquote">``Who says so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>To which Mr. Jobling retorts, <div class="bookquote">``I
say so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>To which Mr. Guppy retorts, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>To which Mr.
Jobling retorts, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>And both being now in a heated state,
they walk on silently for a while to cool down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy then, <div class="bookquote">``if you heard your friend out instead of
flying at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), you wouldn't fall into mistakes. But your temper is
hasty and you are not considerate. Possessing in yourself, Tony, all
that is calculated to charm the eye--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Blow the eye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Weevle, cutting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) short. <div class="bookquote">``Say what

slowly on, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know, in a friendly way, whether you

again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At what place? THAT place?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pointing in the direction of the rag and

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>returns Tony with a most convincing steadfastness, <div class="bookquote">``said
a truer word in all your life. I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>While they are so conversing, a hackney-coach drives into the square,
on the box of which vehicle a very tall hat makes itself manifest to
the public. Inside the coach, and consequently not so manifest to the
multitude, though sufficiently so to the two friends, for the coach
stops almost at their feet, are the venerable Mr. Smallweed and Mrs.
Smallweed, accompanied by their granddaughter Judy.

<p/>An air of haste and excitement pervades the party, and as the tall
hat -LRB-surmounting Mr. Smallweed the younger-RRB- alights, Mr. Smallweed
the elder pokes his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) head out of window and bawls to Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``How
de do, sir! How de do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do Chick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) family want here at this time of the morning,
I wonder!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, nodding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) familiar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>cries Grandfather Smallweed, <div class="bookquote">``would you do me a
favour? Would you and your friend be so very obleeging as to carry me
into the public-house in the court, while Bart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bart</b></font>) sister bring
their grandmother along? Would you do an old man that good turn,
sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy looks at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend, repeating inquiringly, <div class="bookquote">``The
public-house in the court?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>And they prepare to bear the venerable
burden to the Sol's Arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's your fare!''  (<font color='red'><b>the patriarch</b></font>)</div>says the patriarch to the coachman with a fierce
grin and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) incapable fist at him (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ask me for a penny more,
and I'll have my lawful revenge upon you. My dear young men, be easy
with me, if you please. Allow me to catch you round the neck. I won't
squeeze you tighter than I can help. Oh, Lord! Oh, dear me! Oh, my
bones!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Sol</b></font>)</div><p/>It is well that the Sol is not far off, for Mr. Weevle presents an
apoplectic appearance before half the distance is accomplished. With
no worse aggravation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) symptoms, however, than the utterance of
divers croaking sounds expressive of obstructed respiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>)
fulfils his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) share of the porterage and the benevolent old gentleman
is deposited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) own desire in the parlour of the Sol's Arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>gasps Mr. Smallweed, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>), breathless, from
an arm-chair. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me! Oh, my bones and back! Oh, my aches and
pains! Sit down, you dancing, prancing, shambling, scrambling
poll-parrot! Sit down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>This little apostrophe to Mrs. Smallweed is occasioned by a
propensity on the part of that unlucky old lady whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) finds
herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) feet to amble about and <div class="bookquote">``set''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to inanimate objects,
accompanying herself with a chattering noise, as in a witch dance. A
nervous affection has probably as much to do with these
demonstrations as any imbecile intention in the poor old woman, but
on the present occasion they are so particularly lively in connexion
with the Windsor arm-chair, fellow to that in which Mr. Smallweed is
seated, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only quite desists when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grandchildren have held
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) down in it, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lord in the meanwhile bestowing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), with
great volubility, the endearing epithet of <div class="bookquote">``a pig-headed jackdaw,''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>repeated a surprising number of times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Grandfather Smallweed then proceeds, addressing Mr.
Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``there has been a calamity here. Have you heard of it, either
of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heard of it, sir! Why, we discovered it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You discovered it. You two discovered it! Bart, THEY discovered it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The discoverers</b></font>)</div><p/>The two discoverers stare at the Smallweeds, who return the
compliment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>whines Grandfather Smallweed, putting out both his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
hands, <div class="bookquote">``I owe you a thousand thanks for discharging the melancholy
office of discovering the ashes of Mrs. Smallweed's brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Smallweed's brother, my dear friend--her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) only relation. We were
not on terms, which is to be deplored now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) never WOULD be on
terms. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not fond of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was eccentric--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was very
eccentric. Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has left a will -LRB-which is not at all likely-RRB- I
shall take out letters of administration. I have come down to look
after the property; it must be sealed up, it must be protected. I
have come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>repeats Grandfather Smallweed, hooking the air
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) ten fingers at once, <div class="bookquote">``to look after the
property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Small,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says the disconsolate Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``you might have
mentioned that the old man was your uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You two were so close about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I thought you would like me to
be the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns that old bird with a secretly glistening eye.
<div class="bookquote">``Besides, I wasn't proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides which, it was nothing to you, you know, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was or
not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>says Judy. Also with a secretly glistening eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never saw me in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life to know me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Small; <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know why I should introduce HIM, I am sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never communicated with us, which is to be deplored,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>the old
gentleman strikes in, <div class="bookquote">``but I have come to look after the property--to
look over the papers, and to look after the property. We shall make
good our title. It is in the hands of my solicitor. Mr. Tulkinghorn,
of Lincoln's Inn Fields, over the way there, is so good as to act as
my solicitor; and grass don't grow under HIS (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) feet, I can tell ye.
Krook was Mrs. Smallweed's only brother; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) had no relation but
Krook, and Krook had no relation but Mrs. Smallweed. I am speaking of
your brother, you brimstone black-beetle, that was seventy-six years
of age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Smallweed instantly begins to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) head and pipe up,
<div class="bookquote">``Seventy-six pound seven and sevenpence! Seventy-six thousand bags of
money! Seventy-six hundred thousand million of parcels of
bank-notes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will somebody give me a quart pot?''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>exclaims her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) exasperated
husband, looking helplessly about him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and finding no missile within
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reach. <div class="bookquote">``Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon? Will somebody
hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)? You hag, you cat,
you dog, you brimstone barker!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Here Mr. Smallweed, wrought up to the
highest pitch by his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) own eloquence, actually throws Judy at her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
grandmother in default of anything else, by butting that young virgin
at the old lady with such force as he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) can muster and then dropping
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) chair in a heap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shake me up, somebody, if you'll be so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says the voice from
within the faintly struggling bundle into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) has collapsed. <div class="bookquote">``I
have come to look after the property. Shake me up, and call in the
police on duty at the next house to be explained to about the
property. My solicitor will be here presently to protect the
property. Transportation or the gallows for anybody who shall touch
the property!''  (<font color='red'><b>grandchildren</b></font>)</div>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) dutiful grandchildren set him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) up, panting, and
putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) through the usual restorative process of shaking and
punching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) still repeats like an echo, <div class="bookquote">``The--the property! The
property! Property!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy look at each other, the former as having
relinquished the whole affair, the latter with a discomfited
countenance as having entertained some lingering expectations yet.
But there is nothing to be done in opposition to the Smallweed
interest. Mr. Tulkinghorn's clerk comes down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) official pew in
the chambers to mention to the police that Mr. Tulkinghorn is
answerable for its being all correct about the next of kin and that
the papers and effects will be formally taken possession of in due
time and course. Mr. Smallweed is at once permitted so far to assert
his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) supremacy as to be carried on a visit of sentiment into the next
house and upstairs into Miss Flite's deserted room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) looks
like a hideous bird of prey newly added to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) aviary.

<p/>The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court
still makes good for the Sol and keeps the court upon its mettle.
Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins think it hard upon the young man if there
really is no will, and consider that a handsome present ought to be
made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the estate. Young Piper and young Perkins, as members
of that restless juvenile circle which is the terror of the
foot-passengers in Chancery Lane, crumble into ashes behind the pump
and under the archway all day long, where wild yells and hootings
take place over their remains. Little Swills and Miss M. Melvilleson
enter into affable conversation with their patrons, feeling that
these unusual occurrences level the barriers between professionals
and non-professionals. Mr. Bogsby puts up <div class="bookquote">``The popular song of King
Death, with chorus by the whole strength of the company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bogsby/Mr. J. G. Bogsby</b></font>)</div>as the
great Harmonic feature of the week and announces in the bill that <div class="bookquote">``J.
G. B. is induced to do so at a considerable extra expense in
consequence of a wish which has been very generally expressed at the
bar by a large body of respectable individuals and in homage to a
late melancholy event which has aroused so much sensation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bogsby/Mr. J. G. Bogsby</b></font>)</div>There is
one point connected with the deceased upon which the court is
particularly anxious, namely, that the fiction of a full-sized coffin
should be preserved, though there is so little to put in it. Upon the
undertaker's stating in the Sol's bar in the course of the day that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) has received orders to construct <div class="bookquote">``a six-footer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the general
solicitude is much relieved, and it is considered that Mr.
Smallweed's conduct does him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) great honour.

<p/>Out of the court, and a long way out of it, there is considerable
excitement too, for men of science and philosophy come to look, and
carriages set down doctors at the corner who arrive with the same
intent, and there is more learned talk about inflammable gases and
phosphuretted hydrogen than the court has ever imagined. Some of
these authorities -LRB-of course the wisest-RRB- hold with indignation that
the deceased had no business to die in the alleged manner; and being
reminded by other authorities of a certain inquiry into the evidence
for such deaths reprinted in the sixth volume of the Philosophical
Transactions; and also of a book not quite unknown on English medical
jurisprudence; and likewise of the Italian case of the Countess
Cornelia Baudi as set forth in detail by one Bianchini, prebendary of
Verona, who wrote a scholarly work or so and was occasionally heard
of in his (<font color='blue'><b>authorities</b></font>) time as having gleams of reason in him (<font color='blue'><b>authorities</b></font>); and also of the
testimony of Messrs. Fodere and Mere, two pestilent Frenchmen who
WOULD investigate the subject; and further, of the corroborative
testimony of Monsieur Le Cat, a rather celebrated French surgeon once
upon a time, who had the unpoliteness to live in a house where such a
case occurred and even to write an account of it--still they regard
the late Mr. Krook's obstinacy in going out of the world by any such
by-way as wholly unjustifiable and personally offensive. The less the
court understands of all this, the more the court likes it, and the
greater enjoyment it has in the stock in trade of the Sol's Arms.
Then there comes the artist of a picture newspaper, with a foreground
and figures ready drawn for anything from a wreck on the Cornish
coast to a review in Hyde Park or a meeting in Manchester, and in
Mrs. Perkins' own room, memorable evermore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) then and there throws
in upon the block Mr. Krook's house, as large as life; in fact,
considerably larger, making a very temple of it. Similarly, being
permitted to look in at the door of the fatal chamber, he (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) depicts
that apartment as three-quarters of a mile long by fifty yards high,
at which the court is particularly charmed. All this time the two
gentlemen before mentioned pop in and out of every house and assist
at the philosophical disputations--go everywhere and listen to
everybody--and yet are always diving into the Sol's parlour and
writing with the ravenous little pens on the tissue-paper.

<p/>At last come the coroner and his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) inquiry, like as before, except that
the coroner cherishes this case as being out of the common way and
tells the gentlemen of the jury, in his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) private capacity, that <div class="bookquote">``that
would seem to be an unlucky house next door, gentlemen, a destined
house; but so we sometimes find it, and these are mysteries we can't
account for!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>After which the six-footer comes into action and is
much admired.

<p/>In all these proceedings Mr. Guppy has so slight a part, except when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) evidence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is moved on like a private individual
and can only haunt the secret house on the outside, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has the
mortification of seeing Mr. Smallweed padlocking the door, and of
bitterly knowing himself to be shut out. But before these proceedings
draw to a close, that is to say, on the night next after the
catastrophe, Mr. Guppy has a thing to say that must be said to Lady
Dedlock.

<p/>For which reason, with a sinking heart and with that hang-dog sense
of guilt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) which dread and watching enfolded in the Sol's Arms
have produced, the young man of the name of Guppy presents himself at
the town mansion at about seven o'clock in the evening and requests
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship. Mercury replies that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is going out to dinner;
don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) see the carriage at the door? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) does see the carriage
at the door; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) wants to see my Lady too.

<p/>Mercury is disposed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) will presently declare to a
fellow-gentleman in waiting, <div class="bookquote">``to pitch into the young man'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
instructions are positive. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) sulkily supposes that the
young man must come up into the library. There he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaves the young
man in a large room, not over-light, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes report of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Guppy looks into the shade in all directions, discovering
everywhere a certain charred and whitened little heap of coal or
wood. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hears a rustling. Is it--? No, it's no ghost, but
fair flesh and blood, most brilliantly dressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have to beg your ladyship's pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy stammers, very
downcast. <div class="bookquote">``This is an inconvenient time--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you, you could come at any time.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) takes a chair, looking
straight at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) as on the last occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank your ladyship. Your ladyship is very affable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can sit down.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There is not much affability in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, your ladyship, that it's worth while my sitting down
and detaining you, for I--I have not got the letters that I mentioned
when I had the honour of waiting on your ladyship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you come merely to say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merely to say so, your ladyship.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy besides being depressed,
disappointed, and uneasy, is put at a further disadvantage by the
splendour and beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) appearance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knows its influence perfectly, has studied it too well to miss a
grain of its effect on any one. As she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) so steadily and
coldly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) not only feels conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has no guide in the least
perception of what is really the complexion of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thoughts, but also
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is being every moment, as it were, removed further and
further from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will not speak, it is plain. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) must.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In short, your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy like a meanly penitent
thief, <div class="bookquote">``the person I was to have had the letters of, has come to a
sudden end, and--''  (<font color='red'><b>a thief</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) stops. Lady Dedlock calmly finishes the
sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the letters are destroyed with the person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy would say no if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) could--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is unable to hide.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so, your ladyship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) could see the least sparkle of relief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) face now? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
could see no such thing, even if that brave outside did not utterly
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) were not looking beyond it and about it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) falters an awkward excuse or two for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) failure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this all you have to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>inquires Lady Dedlock, having heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) out--or as nearly out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) can stumble.

<p/>Mr. Guppy thinks that's all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better be sure that you wish to say nothing more to me, this
being the last time you will have the opportunity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy is quite sure. And indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has no such wish at present,
by any means.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is enough. I will dispense with excuses. Good evening to you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) rings for Mercury to show the young man of the name of Guppy
out.

<p/>But in that house, in that same moment, there happens to be an old
man of the name of Tulkinghorn. And that old man, coming with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
quiet footstep to the library, has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand at that moment on the
handle of the door--comes in--and comes face to face with the young
man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is leaving the room.

<p/>One glance between the old man and the lady, and for an instant the
blind that is always down flies up. Suspicion, eager and sharp, looks
out. Another instant, close again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Lady Dedlock. I beg your pardon a thousand times.
It is so very unusual to find you here at this hour. I supposed the
room was empty. I beg your pardon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) negligently calls him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``Remain here, I beg. I am
going out to dinner. I have nothing more to say to this young man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>The disconcerted young man bows, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes out, and cringingly hopes
that Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields is well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) bent
brows, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) has no need to look again--not he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``From Kenge and
Carboy's, surely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kenge and Carboy's, Mr. Tulkinghorn. Name of Guppy, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. Why, thank you, Mr. Guppy, I am very well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy to hear it, sir. You can't be too well, sir, for the credit of
the profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Guppy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy sneaks away. Mr. Tulkinghorn, such a foil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
old-fashioned rusty black to Lady Dedlock's brightness, hands her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
down the staircase to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) returns rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chin, and
rubs it a good deal in the course of the evening.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV

<p/>A Turn of the Screw


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``may this be? Is it blank cartridge or
ball? A flash in the pan or a shot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>An open letter is the subject of the trooper's speculations, and it
seems to perplex him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mightily. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looks at it at arm's length, brings
it close to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), holds it in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) right hand, holds it in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left
hand, reads it with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head on this side, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head on that
side, contracts his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyebrows, elevates them, still cannot satisfy
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) smooths it out upon the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heavy palm, and
thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery, makes a halt before it
every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye. Even that won't
do. <div class="bookquote">``Is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George still muses, <div class="bookquote">``blank cartridge or ball?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George muses cartridge</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil Squod, with the aid of a brush and paint-pot, is employed in the
distance whitening the targets, softly whistling in quick-march time
and in drum-and-fife manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) must and will go back again to
the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phil!''  (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div>The trooper beckons as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) calls him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>).

<p/>Phil approaches in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) usual way, sidling off at first as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) were
going anywhere else and then bearing down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) commander like a
bayonet-charge. Certain splashes of white show in high relief upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) dirty face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) scrapes his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) one eyebrow with the handle of the
brush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Attention, Phil! Listen to this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Steady, commander, steady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Sir. Allow me to remind you -LRB-though there is no legal necessity for

due to-morrow, when you will please be prepared to take up the same
on presentation. Yours, Joshua Smallweed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>What do you make of that,
Phil?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mischief, guv`ner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>replies Phil after pensively tracing out a cross-wrinkle
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) forehead with the brush-handle, <div class="bookquote">``that mischeevious
consequences is always meant when money's asked for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lookye, Phil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, sitting on the table. <div class="bookquote">``First and
last, I have paid, I may say, half as much again as this principal in
interest and one thing and another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil intimates by sidling back a pace or two, with a very
unaccountable wrench of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) wry face, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) does not regard the
transaction as being made more promising by this incident.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And lookye further, Phil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, staying his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) premature
conclusions with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``There has always been an
understanding that this bill was to be what they call renewed. And it
has been renewed no end of times. What do you say now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say that I think the times is come to a end at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do? Humph! I am much of the same mind myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joshua Smallweed is him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) that was brought here in a chair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guv`ner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil with exceeding gravity, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)'s a leech in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
dispositions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)'s a screw and a wice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) actions, a snake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
twistings, and a lobster in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) claws.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Having thus expressively uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) sentiments, Mr. Squod, after
waiting a little to ascertain if any further remark be expected of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>), gets back by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) usual series of movements to the target he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) has
in hand and vigorously signifies through his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) former musical medium
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) must and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) will return to that ideal young lady. George,
having folded the letter, walks in that direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There IS a way, commander,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil, looking cunningly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of
settling this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paying the money, I suppose? I wish I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, guv`ner, no; not so bad as that. There IS
a way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>says Phil with a highly artistic turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) brush; <div class="bookquote">``what I'm
a-doing at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whitewashing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil nods.

<p/>``A pretty way that would be! Do you know what would become of the
Bagnets in that case? Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my
old scores? YOU``RE a moral character,'' says the trooper, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) large way with no small indignation; <div class="bookquote">``upon my life you are,
Phil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a character</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil, on one knee at the target, is in course of protesting
earnestly, though not without many allegorical scoops of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) brush
and smoothings of the white surface round the rim with his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) thumb,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) had forgotten the Bagnet responsibility and would not so much
as injure a hair of the head of any member of that worthy family when
steps are audible in the long passage without, and a cheerful voice
is heard to wonder whether George is at home. Phil, with a look at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) master, hobbles up, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Here's the guv`ner, Mrs. Bagnet!
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>and the old girl herself, accompanied by Mr. Bagnet,
appears.

<p/>The old girl never appears in walking trim, in any season of the
year, without a grey cloth cloak, coarse and much worn but very
clean, which is, undoubtedly, the identical garment rendered so
interesting to Mr. Bagnet by having made its way home to Europe from
another quarter of the globe in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an
umbrella. The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of
the old girl's presence out of doors. It is of no colour known in
this life and has a corrugated wooden crook for a handle, with a
metallic object let into its prow, or beak, resembling a little model
of a fanlight over a street door or one of the oval glasses out of a
pair of spectacles, which ornamental object has not that tenacious
capacity of sticking to its post that might be desired in an article
long associated with the British army. The old girl's umbrella is of
a flabby habit of waist and seems to be in need of stays--an
appearance that is possibly referable to its having served through a
series of years at home as a cupboard and on journeys as a carpet
bag. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never puts it up, having the greatest reliance on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
well-proved cloak with its capacious hood, but generally uses the
instrument as a wand with which to point out joints of meat or
bunches of greens in marketing or to arrest the attention of
tradesmen by a friendly poke. Without her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) market-basket, which is a
sort of wicker well with two flapping lids, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never stirs abroad.
Attended by these her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trusty companions, therefore, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) honest
sunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet, Mrs.
Bagnet now arrives, fresh-coloured and bright, in George's Shooting
Gallery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, George, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and how do YOU do, this
sunshiny morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Giving him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a friendly shake of the hand, Mrs. Bagnet draws a long
breath after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) walk and sits down to enjoy a rest. Having a
faculty, matured on the tops of baggage-waggons and in other such
positions, of resting easily anywhere, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) perches on a rough bench,
unties her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) bonnet-strings, pushes back her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) bonnet, crosses her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) arms,
and looks perfectly comfortable.

<p/>Mr. Bagnet in the meantime has shaken hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) old comrade and
with Phil, on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise bestows a good-humoured nod
and smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bagnet briskly, <div class="bookquote">``here we are, Lignum and
myself'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) often speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) husband by this appellation, on
account, as it is supposed, of Lignum Vitae having been his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) old
regimental nickname when they first became acquainted, in compliment
to the extreme hardness and toughness of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) physiognomy--<div class="bookquote">``just
looked in, we have, to make it all correct as usual about that
security. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) the new bill to sign, George, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll sign it
like a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lignum/Lignum Vitae</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was coming to you this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>observes the trooper reluctantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we thought you'd come to us this morning, but we turned out
early and left Woolwich, the best of boys, to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sisters and
came to you instead--as you see! For Lignum, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s tied so close now,
and gets so little exercise, that a walk does him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) good. But what's
the matter, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>asks Mrs. Bagnet, stopping in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) cheerful talk.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't look yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not quite myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper; <div class="bookquote">``I have been a little
put out, Mrs. Bagnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) bright quick eye catches the truth directly. <div class="bookquote">``George!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>holding up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) forefinger. <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me there's anything wrong about that
security of Lignum's! Don't do it, George, on account of the
children!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper looks at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) with a troubled visage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet, using both her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) arms for emphasis and
occasionally bringing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) open hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``If you
have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of Lignum's, and
if you have let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in for it, and if you have put us in danger of
being sold up--and I see sold up in your face, George, as plain as
print--you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly.
I tell you, cruelly, George. There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet, otherwise as immovable as a pump or a lamp-post, puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
large right hand on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) bald head as if to defend it from
a shower-bath and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>says that old girl, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder at you! George, I am ashamed
of you! George, I couldn't have believed you would have done it! I
always knew you to be a rolling stone that gathered no moss, but I
never thought you would have taken away what little moss there was
for Bagnet and the children to lie upon. You know what a
hard-working, steady-going chap he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) is. You know what Quebec and Malta
and Woolwich are, and I never did think you would, or could, have had
the heart to serve us so. Oh, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bagnet gathers up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
cloak to wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) eyes on in a very genuine manner, <div class="bookquote">``How could you do
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet ceasing, Mr. Bagnet removes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) head as if
the shower-bath were over and looks disconsolately at Mr. George, who
has turned quite white and looks distressfully at the grey cloak and
straw bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mat,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper in a subdued voice, addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) but still
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you take it so much to heart,
because I do hope it's not so bad as that comes to. I certainly have,
this morning, received this letter'' (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>--which he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) reads aloud--<div class="bookquote">``but I
hope it may be set right yet. As to a rolling stone, why, what you

way, I fully believe, that I rolled the least good to. But it's
impossible for an old vagabond comrade to like your wife and family
better than I like 'em, Mat, and I trust you'll look upon me as
forgivingly as you can. Don't think I've kept anything from you. I
haven't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>murmurs Mr. Bagnet after a short silence, <div class="bookquote">``will you tell

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Mat</b></font>) marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bagnet answers, half laughing and
half crying, <div class="bookquote">``Joe Pouch's widder in North America? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mat</b></font>) wouldn't
have got himself into these troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``puts it correct--why didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has a better husband by this time, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the
trooper. <div class="bookquote">``Anyhow, here I stand, this present day, NOT married to Joe
Pouch's widder. What shall I do? You see all I have got about me.
It's not mine; it's yours. Give the word, and I'll sell off every

wanted, I'd have sold all long ago. Don't believe that I'll leave you
or yours in the lurch, Mat. I'd sell myself first. I only wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says
the trooper, giving himself a disparaging blow in the chest, <div class="bookquote">``that I

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>murmurs Mr. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mat</b></font>) another bit of my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>says the old girl, <div class="bookquote">``you are not so much to be blamed, on

means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that was like me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>observes the penitent trooper, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
head. <div class="bookquote">``Like me, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence! The old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``is correct--in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way of

though a little flighty. On the other hand, you can't admit but what
it's natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over our
heads. So forget and forgive all round, George. Come! Forget and
forgive all round!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) honest hands and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)

them while he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) speaks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do assure you both, there's nothing I wouldn't do to discharge

gone every two months in keeping it up. We have lived plainly enough
here, Phil and I. But the gallery don't quite do what was expected of
it, and it's not--in short, it's not the mint. It was wrong in me to
take it? Well, so it was. But I was in a manner drawn into that step,
and I thought it might steady me, and set me up, and you'll try to
overlook my having such expectations, and upon my soul, I am very
much obliged to you, and very much ashamed of myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>With these
concluding words, Mr. George gives a shake to each of the hands he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
holds, and relinquishing them, backs a pace or two in a
broad-chested, upright attitude, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had made a final confession
and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George, hear me out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Old
girl, go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet, being in this singular manner heard out, has merely to
observe that the letter must be attended to without any delay, that
it is advisable that George and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should immediately wait on Mr.
Smallweed in person, and that the primary object is to save and hold
harmless Mr. Bagnet, who had none of the money. Mr. George, entirely
assenting, puts on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hat and prepares to march with Mr. Bagnet to
the enemy's camp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you mind a woman's hasty word, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet,
patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I trust my old Lignum to you, and I am
sure you'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) through it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper returns that this is kindly said and that he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) WILL bring
Lignum through it somehow. Upon which Mrs. Bagnet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) cloak,
basket, and umbrella, goes home, bright-eyed again, to the rest of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) family, and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of
mollifying Mr. Smallweed.

<p/>Whether there are two people in England less likely to come
satisfactorily out of any negotiation with Mr. Smallweed than Mr.
George and Mr. Matthew Bagnet may be very reasonably questioned.
Also, notwithstanding their martial appearance, broad square
shoulders, and heavy tread, whether there are within the same limits
two more simple and unaccustomed children in all the Smallweedy
affairs of life. As they proceed with great gravity through the
streets towards the region of Mount Pleasant, Mr. Bagnet, observing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) companion to be thoughtful, considers it a friendly part to refer
to Mrs. Bagnet's late sally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George, you know the old girl--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s as sweet and as mild as milk.
But touch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the children--or myself--and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s off like

without relaxing the rigidity of a single muscle. <div class="bookquote">``Think as high of
the old girl--as the rock of Gibraltar--and still you'll be thinking
low--of such merits. But I never own to it before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Discipline
must be maintained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mount Pleasant</b></font>)</div><p/>These encomiums bring them to Mount Pleasant and to Grandfather
Smallweed's house. The door is opened by the perennial Judy, who,
having surveyed them from top to toe with no particular favour, but
indeed with a malignant sneer, leaves them standing there while she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
consults the oracle as to their admission. The oracle may be inferred
to give consent from the circumstance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) returning with the words
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) honey lips that they can come in if they want to it. Thus
privileged, they come in and find Mr. Smallweed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) feet in the
drawer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) chair as if it were a paper foot-bath and Mrs.
Smallweed obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed with those two lean
affectionate arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) stretched forth. <div class="bookquote">``How de do? How de do? Who
is our friend, my dear friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returns George, not able to be very conciliatory at
first, <div class="bookquote">``is Matthew Bagnet, who has obliged me in that matter of ours,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Bagnet? Surely!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hope you're well, Mr. Bagnet? Fine man, Mr. George! Military air,
sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>No chairs being offered, Mr. George brings one forward for Bagnet and
one for himself. They sit down, Mr. Bagnet as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) had no power of
bending himself, except at the hips, for that purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Judy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Smallweed, <div class="bookquote">``bring the pipe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George interposes, <div class="bookquote">``that the young woman
need give herself that trouble, for to tell you the truth, I am not
inclined to smoke it to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the man</b></font>)</div>returns the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Judy, bring the pipe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, Mr. Smallweed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>proceeds George, <div class="bookquote">``that I find myself in
rather an unpleasant state of mind. It appears to me, sir, that your
friend in the city has been playing tricks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) never does that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? Well, I am glad to hear it, because I thought it might be
HIS (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doing. This, you know, I am speaking of. This letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the
letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Judy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Have you got the pipe? Give it to me. Did
you say what does it mean, my good friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! Now, come, come, you know, Mr. Smallweed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>urges the trooper,
constraining himself to speak as smoothly and confidentially as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
can, holding the open letter in one hand and resting the broad
knuckles of the other on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thigh, <div class="bookquote">``a good lot of money has passed
between us, and we are face to face at the present moment, and are
both well aware of the understanding there has always been. I am
prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to
keep this matter going. I never got a letter like this from you
before, and I have been a little put about by it this morning,
because here's my friend Matthew Bagnet, who, you know, had none of
the money--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``I DON<div class="bookquote">``T know it, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the old man quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, con-found you--it, I mean--I tell you so, don't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, you tell me so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>returns Grandfather Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``But I
don't know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) fire. <div class="bookquote">``I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed replies with excellent temper, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! That's quite
another thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>And adds, <div class="bookquote">``But it don't matter. Mr. Bagnet's
situation is all one, whether or no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>The unfortunate George makes a great effort to arrange the affair
comfortably and to propitiate Mr. Smallweed by taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
own terms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I mean. As you say, Mr. Smallweed, here's Matthew
Bagnet liable to be fixed whether or no. Now, you see, that makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
good lady very uneasy in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind, and me too, for whereas I'm a
harum-scarum sort of a good-for-nought that more kicks than halfpence
come natural to, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)'s a steady family man, don't you see? Now,
Mr. Smallweed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper confidence</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, gaining confidence as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) proceeds
in his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) soldierly mode of doing business, <div class="bookquote">``although you and I are good
friends enough in a certain sort of a way, I am well aware that I
can't ask you to let my friend Bagnet off entirely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, you are too modest. You can ASK me anything, Mr. George.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>-LRB-There is an ogreish kind of jocularity in Grandfather Smallweed
to-day.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you can refuse, you mean, eh? Or not you so much, perhaps, as
your friend in the city? Ha ha ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha ha ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>echoes Grandfather Smallweed. In such a very hard manner
and with eyes so particularly green that Mr. Bagnet's natural gravity
is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says the sanguine George. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to find we can be
pleasant, because I want to arrange this pleasantly. Here's my friend
Bagnet, and here am I. We'll settle the matter on the spot, if you
please, Mr. Smallweed, in the usual way. And you'll ease my friend
Bagnet's mind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) family's mind, a good deal if you'll just
mention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) what our understanding is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here some shrill spectre cries out in a mocking manner, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, good
gracious! Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Judy</b></font>)</div>Unless, indeed, it be the sportive Judy, who is found
to be silent when the startled visitors look round, but whose chin
has received a recent toss, expressive of derision and contempt. Mr.
Bagnet's gravity becomes yet more profound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think you asked me, Mr. George'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>--old Smallweed, who all this
time has had the pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) hand, is the speaker now--<div class="bookquote">``I think you
asked me, what did the letter mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper in his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) off-hand way, <div class="bookquote">``but I
don't care to know particularly, if it's all correct and pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed, purposely balking himself in an aim at the trooper's
head, throws the pipe on the ground and breaks it to pieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what it means, my dear friend. I'll smash you. I'll crumble
you. I'll powder you. Go to the devil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friends</b></font>)</div><p/>The two friends rise and look at one another. Mr. Bagnet's gravity
has now attained its profoundest point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to the devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>repeats the man</b></font>)</div>repeats the old man. <div class="bookquote">``I'll have no more of your
pipe-smokings and swaggerings. What? You're an independent dragoon,
too! Go to my lawyer -LRB-you remember where; you have been there before-RRB-
and show your independence now, will you? Come, my dear friend,
there's a chance for you. Open the street door, Judy; put these
blusterers out! Call in help if they don't go. Put 'em out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vociferates this so loudly that Mr. Bagnet, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hands on
the shoulders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) comrade before the latter can recover from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
amazement, gets him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) on the outside of the street door, which is
instantly slammed by the triumphant Judy. Utterly confounded, Mr.
George awhile stands looking at the knocker. Mr. Bagnet, in a perfect
abyss of gravity, walks up and down before the little parlour window
like a sentry and looks in every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) passes, apparently revolving
something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has recovered himself, <div class="bookquote">``we must
try the lawyer. Now, what do you think of this rascal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet, stopping to take a farewell look into the parlour,
replies with one shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) head directed at the interior, <div class="bookquote">``If my
old girl had been here--I'd have told him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Having so discharged
himself of the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) cogitations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) falls into step and
marches off with the trooper, shoulder to shoulder.

<p/>When they present themselves in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Mr. Tulkinghorn
is engaged and not to be seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is not at all willing to see them,
for when they have waited a full hour, and the clerk, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) bell
being rung, takes the opportunity of mentioning as much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) brings
forth no more encouraging message than that Mr. Tulkinghorn has
nothing to say to them and they had better not wait. They do wait,
however, with the perseverance of military tactics, and at last the
bell rings again and the client in possession comes out of Mr.
Tulkinghorn's room.

<p/>The client is a handsome old lady, no other than Mrs. Rouncewell,
housekeeper at Chesney Wold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) comes out of the sanctuary with a
fair old-fashioned curtsy and softly shuts the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is treated
with some distinction there, for the clerk steps out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) pew to
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) through the outer office and to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) out. The old lady is
thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) attention when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) observes the comrades in
waiting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir, but I think those gentlemen are military?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The clerk George</b></font>)</div><p/>The clerk referring the question to them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) eye, and Mr. George
not turning round from the almanac over the fire-place. Mr. Bagnet
takes upon himself to reply, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am. Formerly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so. I was sure of it. My heart warms, gentlemen, at the
sight of you. It always does at the sight of such. God bless you,
gentlemen! You'll excuse an old woman, but I had a son once who went
for a soldier. A fine handsome youth he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was, and good in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) bold
way, though some people did disparage him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) poor mother. I ask
your pardon for troubling you, sir. God bless you, gentlemen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Same to you, ma'am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bagnet with right good will.

<p/>There is something very touching in the earnestness of the old lady's
voice and in the tremble that goes through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) quaint old figure. But
Mr. George is so occupied with the almanac over the fire-place
-LRB-calculating the coming months by it perhaps-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) does not look
round until she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has gone away and the door is closed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bagnet gruffly whispers when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) does turn from the
almanac at last. ``Don't be cast down! ``Why, soldiers, why--should we
be melancholy, boys?<div class="bookquote">'' Cheer up, my hearty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>soldiers boys</b></font>)</div><p/>The clerk having now again gone in to say that they are still there
and Mr. Tulkinghorn being heard to return with some irascibility,
<div class="bookquote">``Let 'em come in then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>they pass into the great room with the
painted ceiling and find him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) standing before the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you men, what do you want? Sergeant, I told you the last time I
saw you that I don't desire your company here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergeant replies--dashed within the last few minutes as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) usual
manner of speech, and even as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) usual carriage--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) has
received this letter, has been to Mr. Smallweed about it, and has
been referred there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``If you get
into debt, you must pay your debts or take the consequences. You have
no occasion to come here to learn that, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergeant is sorry to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is not prepared with the money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! Then the other man--this man, if this is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--must pay it
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergeant is sorry to add that the other man is not prepared with the
money either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! Then you must pay it between you or you must both be sued
for it and both suffer. You have had the money and must refund it.
You are not to pocket other people's pounds, shillings, and pence and
escape scot-free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>The lawyer sits down in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) easy-chair and stirs the fire. Mr. George
hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will have the goodness to--<div class="bookquote">``I tell you, sergeant, I have
nothing to say to you. I don't like your associates and don't want
you here. This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is
not in my office. Mr. Smallweed is good enough to offer these affairs
to me, but they are not in my way. You must go to Melchisedech's in
Clifford's Inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must make an apology to you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``for pressing
myself upon you with so little encouragement--which is almost as
unpleasant to me as it can be to you--but would you let me say a
private word to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn rises with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pockets and walks into
one of the window recesses. <div class="bookquote">``Now! I have no time to waste.''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>In the
midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) perfect assumption of indifference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) directs a sharp
look at the trooper, taking care to stand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own back to the
light and to have the other with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) face towards it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``this man with me is the other party
implicated in this unfortunate affair--nominally, only nominally--and
my sole object is to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) getting into trouble on my account.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a most respectable man with a wife and family, formerly in the
Royal Artillery--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend, I don't care a pinch of snuff for the whole Royal
Artillery establishment--officers, men, tumbrils, waggons, horses,
guns, and ammunition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis likely, sir. But I care a good deal for Bagnet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wife and
family being injured on my account. And if I could bring them through
this matter, I should have no help for it but to give up without any
other consideration what you wanted of me the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got it here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have got it here, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sergeant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>the lawyer proceeds in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) dry passionless manner, far
more hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence, <div class="bookquote">``make
up your mind while I speak to you, for this is final. After I have
finished speaking I have closed the subject, and I won't re-open it.
Understand that. You can leave here, for a few days, what you say you
have brought here if you choose; you can take it away at once if you
choose. In case you choose to leave it here, I can do this for you--I
can replace this matter on its old footing, and I can go so far
besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet
shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded
against to the utmost, that your means shall be exhausted before the
creditor looks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>). This is in fact all but freeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>). Have you
decided?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper puts his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) breast and answers with a long
breath, <div class="bookquote">``I must do it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mr. Tulkinghorn, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) spectacles, sits down and writes
the undertaking, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) slowly reads and explains to Bagnet, who
has all this time been staring at the ceiling and who puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hand
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) bald head again, under this new verbal shower-bath, and seems
exceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
sentiments. The trooper then takes from his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) breast-pocket a folded
paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer's elbow.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tis only a letter of instructions, sir. The last I ever had from
him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Look at a millstone, Mr. George, for some change in its expression,
and you will find it quite as soon as in the face of Mr. Tulkinghorn
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) opens and reads the letter! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) refolds it and lays it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
desk with a countenance as unperturbable as death.

<p/>Nor has he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) anything more to say or do but to nod once in the same
frigid and discourteous manner and to say briefly, <div class="bookquote">``You can go. Show
these men out, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Being shown out, they repair to Mr. Bagnet's
residence to dine.

<p/>Boiled beef and greens constitute the day's variety on the former
repast of boiled pork and greens, and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal
in the same way and seasons it with the best of temper, being that
rare sort of old girl that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) receives Good to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms without a
hint that it might be Better and catches light from any little spot
of darkness near her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The spot on this occasion is the darkened brow
of Mr. George; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is unusually thoughtful and depressed. At first
Mrs. Bagnet trusts to the combined endearments of Quebec and Malta to
restore him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but finding those young ladies sensible that their
existing Bluffy is not the Bluffy of their usual frolicsome
acquaintance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) winks off the light infantry and leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to
deploy at leisure on the open ground of the domestic hearth.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) does not. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) remains in close order, clouded and depressed.
During the lengthy cleaning up and pattening process, when he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) and Mr.
Bagnet are supplied with their pipes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is no better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) was at
dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) forgets to smoke, looks at the fire and ponders, lets his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
pipe out, fills the breast of Mr. Bagnet with perturbation and dismay
by showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) has no enjoyment of tobacco.

<p/>Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears, rosy from the
invigorating pail, and sits down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) work, Mr. Bagnet growls, <div class="bookquote">``Old
girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>and winks monitions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) to find out what's the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet, quietly threading her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) needle. <div class="bookquote">``How
low you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I? Not good company? Well, I am afraid I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ain't at all like Bluffy, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries little Malta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ain't well, I think, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>adds Quebec.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure that's a bad sign not to be like Bluffy, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the
trooper, kissing the young damsels. <div class="bookquote">``But it's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a sigh,
<div class="bookquote">``true, I am afraid. These little ones are always right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet, working busily, <div class="bookquote">``if I thought you cross
enough to think of anything that a shrill old soldier's wife--who
could have bitten her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tongue off afterwards and ought to have done it
almost--said this morning, I don't know what I shouldn't say to you
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My kind soul of a darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper. <div class="bookquote">``Not a morsel of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because really and truly, George, what I said and meant to say was
that I trusted Lignum to you and was sure you'd bring him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) through it.
And you HAVE brought him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) through it, noble!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says George. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad of your good opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>In giving Mrs. Bagnet's hand, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) work in it, a friendly
shake--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) seat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--the trooper's attention is
attracted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) face. After looking at it for a little while as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
plies her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) needle, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looks to young Woolwich, sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stool in
the corner, and beckons that fifer to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See there, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says George, very gently smoothing the mother's
hair with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``there's a good loving forehead for you! All
bright with love of you, my boy. A little touched by the sun and the
weather through following your father about and taking care of you,
but as fresh and wholesome as a ripe apple on a tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet's face expresses, so far as in its wooden material lies,
the highest approbation and acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time will come, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>pursues the trooper, ``when this hair of
your mother's will be grey, and this forehead all crossed and
re-crossed with wrinkles, and a fine old lady she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll be then. Take
care, while you are young, that you can think in those days, ``I never
whitened a hair of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dear head--I never marked a sorrowful line in
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face!<div class="bookquote">'' For of all the many things that you can think of when you
are a man, you had better have THAT by you, Woolwich!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George concludes by rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair, seating the boy beside
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother in it, and saying, with something of a hurry about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe in the street a bit.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXV

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>I lay ill through several weeks, and the usual tenor of my life
became like an old remembrance. But this was not the effect of time
so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness
and inaction of a sick-room. Before I had been confined to it many
days, everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance
where there was little or no separation between the various stages of
my life which had been really divided by years. In falling ill, I
seemed to have crossed a dark lake and to have left all my
experiences, mingled together by the great distance, on the healthy
shore.

<p/>My housekeeping duties, though at first it caused me great anxiety to
think that they were unperformed, were soon as far off as the oldest
of the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer afternoons when I went
home from school with my portfolio under my arm, and my childish
shadow at my side, to my godmother's house. I had never known before
how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could
put it.

<p/>While I was very ill, the way in which these divisions of time became
confused with one another distressed my mind exceedingly. At once a
child, an elder girl, and the little woman I had been so happy as, I
was not only oppressed by cares and difficulties adapted to each
station, but by the great perplexity of endlessly trying to reconcile
them. I suppose that few who have not been in such a condition can
quite understand what I mean or what painful unrest arose from this
source.

<p/>For the same reason I am almost afraid to hint at that time in my
disorder--it seemed one long night, but I believe there were both
nights and days in it--when I laboured up colossal staircases, ever
striving to reach the top, and ever turned, as I have seen a worm in
a garden path, by some obstruction, and labouring again. I knew
perfectly at intervals, and I think vaguely at most times, that I was
in my bed; and I talked with Charley, and felt her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) touch, and knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) very well; yet I would find myself complaining, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, more of
these never-ending stairs, Charley--more and more--piled up to the
sky', I think!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and labouring on again.

<p/>Dare I hint at that worse time when, strung together somewhere in
great black space, there was a flaming necklace, or ring, or starry
circle of some kind, of which I was one of the beads! And when my
only prayer was to be taken off from the rest and when it was such
inexplicable agony and misery to be a part of the dreadful thing?

<p/>Perhaps the less I say of these sick experiences, the less tedious
and the more intelligible I shall be. I do not recall them to make
others unhappy or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering
them. It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we
might be the better able to alleviate their intensity.

<p/>The repose that succeeded, the long delicious sleep, the blissful
rest, when in my weakness I was too calm to have any care for myself
and could have heard -LRB-or so I think now-RRB- that I was dying, with no
other emotion than with a pitying love for those I left behind--this
state can be perhaps more widely understood. I was in this state when
I first shrunk from the light as it twinkled on me once more, and
knew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough
that I should see again.

<p/>I had heard my Ada crying at the door, day and night; I had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
calling to me that I was cruel and did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>); I had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
praying and imploring to be let in to nurse and comfort me and to
leave my bedside no more; but I had only said, when I could speak,
<div class="bookquote">``Never, my sweet girl, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I had over and over again reminded
Charley that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was to keep my darling from the room whether I lived
or died. Charley had been true to me in that time of need, and with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) little hand and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) great heart had kept the door fast.

<p/>But now, my sight strengthening and the glorious light coming every
day more fully and brightly on me, I could read the letters that my
dear wrote to me every morning and evening and could put them to my
lips and lay my cheek upon them with no fear of hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). I could
see my little maid, so tender and so careful, going about the two
rooms setting everything in order and speaking cheerfully to Ada from
the open window again. I could understand the stillness in the house
and the thoughtfulness it expressed on the part of all those who had
always been so good to me. I could weep in the exquisite felicity of
my heart and be as happy in my weakness as ever I had been in my
strength.

<p/>By and by my strength began to be restored. Instead of lying, with so
strange a calmness, watching what was done for me, as if it were done
for some one else whom I was quietly sorry for, I helped it a little,
and so on to a little more and much more, until I became useful to
myself, and interested, and attached to life again.

<p/>How well I remember the pleasant afternoon when I was raised in bed
with pillows for the first time to enjoy a great tea-drinking with
Charley! The little creature--sent into the world, surely, to
minister to the weak and sick--was so happy, and so busy, and stopped
so often in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) preparations to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head upon my bosom, and
fondle me, and cry with joyful tears she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was so glad, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was so
glad, that I was obliged to say, <div class="bookquote">``Charley, if you go on in this way,
I must lie down again, my darling, for I am weaker than I thought I
was!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So Charley became as quiet as a mouse and took her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bright face
here and there across and across the two rooms, out of the shade into
the divine sunshine, and out of the sunshine into the shade, while I
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) peacefully. When all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) preparations were concluded and
the pretty tea-table with its little delicacies to tempt me, and its
white cloth, and its flowers, and everything so lovingly and
beautifully arranged for me by Ada downstairs, was ready at the
bedside, I felt sure I was steady enough to say something to Charley
that was not new to my thoughts.

<p/>First I complimented Charley on the room, and indeed it was so fresh
and airy, so spotless and neat, that I could scarce believe I had
been lying there so long. This delighted Charley, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face was
brighter than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, looking round, <div class="bookquote">``I miss something, surely,
that I am accustomed to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor little Charley looked round too and pretended to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head
as if there were nothing absent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the pictures all as they used to be?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one of them, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the furniture, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except where I have moved it about to make more room, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I miss some familiar object. Ah, I know what it
is, Charley! It's the looking-glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley got up from the table, making as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had forgotten
something, and went into the next room; and I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) sob there.

<p/>I had thought of this very often. I was now certain of it. I could
thank God that it was not a shock to me now. I called Charley back,
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) came--at first pretending to smile, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) drew
nearer to me, looking grieved--I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) in my arms and said, <div class="bookquote">``It
matters very little, Charley. I hope I can do without my old face
very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>I was presently so far advanced as to be able to sit up in a great
chair and even giddily to walk into the adjoining room, leaning on
Charley. The mirror was gone from its usual place in that room too,
but what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that.

<p/>My guardian had throughout been earnest to visit me, and there was
now no good reason why I should deny myself that happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) came
one morning, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) first came in, could only hold me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
embrace and say, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, dear girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I had long known--who could
know better?--what a deep fountain of affection and generosity his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
heart was; and was it not worth my trivial suffering and change to
fill such a place in it? <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) has seen me, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) loves me better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) did; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) has seen me and is even fonder of
me than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was before; and what have I to mourn for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) sat down by me on the sofa, supporting me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) arm. For a
little while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) face, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) removed
it, fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) usual manner. There never can have been, there
never can be, a pleasanter manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what a sad time this has been. Such an
inflexible little woman, too, through all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for the best, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For the best?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) repeated tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, for the best. But
here have Ada and I been perfectly forlorn and miserable; here has
your friend Caddy been coming and going late and early; here has
every one about the house been utterly lost and dejected; here has
even poor Rick been writing--to ME too--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) anxiety for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had read of Caddy in Ada's letters, but not of Richard. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I have thought it better not to
mention it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) writing to YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``As if it were not natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) to do so, guardian; as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) could write to a better friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) could, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``and to many a
better. The truth is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) wrote to me under a sort of protest while
unable to write to you with any hope of an answer--wrote coldly,
haughtily, distantly, resentfully. Well, dearest little woman, we
must look forbearingly on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) is not to blame. Jarndyce and
Jarndyce has warped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) out of himself and perverted me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) eyes.
I have known it do as bad deeds, and worse, many a time. If two
angels could be concerned in it, I believe it would change their
nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has not changed yours, guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, it has, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said laughingly. <div class="bookquote">``It has made the
south wind easterly, I don't know how often. Rick mistrusts and
suspects me--goes to lawyers, and is taught to mistrust and suspect
me. Hears I have conflicting interests, claims clashing against his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)
and what not. Whereas, heaven knows that if I could get out of the
mountains of wiglomeration on which my unfortunate name has been so
long bestowed -LRB-which I can't-RRB- or could level them by the extinction
of my own original right -LRB-which I can't either, and no human power
ever can, anyhow, I believe, to such a pass have we got-RRB-, I would do
it this hour. I would rather restore to poor Rick his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) proper nature
than be endowed with all the money that dead suitors, broken, heart
and soul, upon the wheel of Chancery, have left unclaimed with the
Accountant-General--and that's money enough, my dear, to be cast into
a pyramid, in memory of Chancery's transcendent wickedness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``IS it possible, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, amazed, <div class="bookquote">``that Richard can be
suspicious of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my love, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is in the subtle poison of such
abuses to breed such diseases. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) blood is infected, and objects
lose their natural aspects in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sight. It is not HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a terrible misfortune, guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a terrible misfortune, little woman, to be ever drawn within
the influences of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. I know none greater. By
little and little he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) has been induced to trust in that rotten reed,
and it communicates some portion of its rottenness to everything
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). But again I say with all my soul, we must be patient with
poor Rick and not blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>). What a troop of fine fresh hearts like
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) have I seen in my time turned by the same means!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help expressing something of my wonder and regret that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) benevolent, disinterested intentions had prospered so little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not say so, Dame Durden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) cheerfully replied; <div class="bookquote">``Ada is the
happier, I hope, and that is much. I did think that I and both these
young creatures might be friends instead of distrustful foes and that
we might so far counter-act the suit and prove too strong for it. But
it was too much to expect. Jarndyce and Jarndyce was the curtain of
Rick's cradle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) what a false and wretched thing it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We WILL hope so, my Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``and that it may not
teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) so too late. In any case we must not be hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>). There
are not many grown and matured men living while we speak, good men
too, who if they were thrown into this same court as suitors would
not be vitally changed and depreciated within three years--within
two--within one. How can we stand amazed at poor Rick? A young man so
unfortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) fell into a lower tone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) were thinking
aloud, <div class="bookquote">``cannot at first believe -LRB-who could?-RRB- that Chancery is what it
is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) looks to it, flushed and fitfully, to do something with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)
interests and bring them to some settlement. It procrastinates,
disappoints, tries, tortures him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>); wears out his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) sanguine hopes and
patience, thread by thread; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) still looks to it, and hankers
after it, and finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) whole world treacherous and hollow. Well,
well, well! Enough of this, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had supported me, as at first, all this time, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) tenderness
was so precious to me that I leaned my head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) shoulder and
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) had been my father. I resolved in my own mind in
this little pause, by some means, to see Richard when I grew strong
and try to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are better subjects than these,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``for such a
joyful time as the time of our dear girl's recovery. And I had a
commission to broach one of them as soon as I should begin to talk.
When shall Ada come to see you, my love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>I had been thinking of that too. A little in connexion with the
absent mirrors, but not much, for I knew my loving girl would be
changed by no change in my looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``as I have shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) out so long--though
indeed, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is like the light to me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it well, Dame Durden, well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was so good, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) touch expressed such endearing compassion and
affection, and the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) voice carried such comfort into my
heart that I stopped for a little while, quite unable to go on. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
yes, you are tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Rest a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I have kept Ada out so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began afresh after a short while,
<div class="bookquote">``I think I should like to have my own way a little longer, guardian.
It would be best to be away from here before I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). If Charley
and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move, and
if I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by
the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with
me again, I think it would be better for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used
to my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so
ardently to see, but it is the truth. I did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) understood me, I was
sure; but I was not afraid of that. If it were a poor thing, I knew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would pass it over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our spoilt little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own way
even in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inflexibility, though at the price, I know, of tears
downstairs. And see here! Here is Boythorn, heart of chivalry,
breathing such ferocious vows as never were breathed on paper before,
that if you don't go and occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) whole house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) having already
turned out of it expressly for that purpose, by heaven and by earth
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)'ll pull it down and not leave one brick standing on another!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>And my guardian put a letter in my hand, without any ordinary
beginning such as <div class="bookquote">``My dear Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>but rushing at once into the
words, <div class="bookquote">``I swear if Miss Summerson do not come down and take
possession of my house, which I vacate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) this day at one
o'clock, P.M.,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>and then with the utmost seriousness, and in the most
emphatic terms, going on to make the extraordinary declaration he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had
quoted. We did not appreciate the writer the less for laughing
heartily over it, and we settled that I should send him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) a letter of
thanks on the morrow and accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) offer. It was a most agreeable
one to me, for all the places I could have thought of, I should have
liked to go to none so well as Chesney Wold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, little housewife,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``I
was strictly timed before I came upstairs, for you must not be tired
too soon; and my time has waned away to the last minute. I have one
other petition. Little Miss Flite, hearing a rumour that you were
ill, made nothing of walking down here--twenty miles, poor soul, in a
pair of dancing shoes--to inquire. It was heaven's mercy we were at
home, or she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) would have walked back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>The old conspiracy to make me happy! Everybody seemed to be in it!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``if it would not be irksome to you to
admit the harmless little creature one afternoon before you save
Boythorn's otherwise devoted house from demolition, I believe you
would make her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) prouder and better pleased with herself than I--though
my eminent name is Jarndyce--could do in a lifetime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>I have no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) knew there would be something in the simple image
of the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson
on my mind at that time. I felt it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) spoke to me. I could not
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) heartily enough how ready I was to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I had always
pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), never so much as now. I had always been glad of my little
power to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) calamity, but never, never, half so
glad before.

<p/>We arranged a time for Miss Flite to come out by the coach and share
my early dinner. When my guardian left me, I turned my face away upon
my couch and prayed to be forgiven if I, surrounded by such
blessings, had magnified to myself the little trial that I had to
undergo. The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired
to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to do good to some
one and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind
with a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and
all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me. If I
were weak now, what had I profited by those mercies? I repeated the
old childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old
peace had not departed from it.

<p/>My guardian now came every day. In a week or so more I could walk
about our rooms and hold long talks with Ada from behind the
window-curtain. Yet I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), for I had not as yet the courage
to look at the dear face, though I could have done so easily without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) seeing me.

<p/>On the appointed day Miss Flite arrived. The poor little creature ran
into my room quite forgetful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) usual dignity, and crying from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) very heart of hearts, <div class="bookquote">``My dear Fitz Jarndyce!''  (<font color='red'><b>The creature</b></font>)</div>fell upon my neck
and kissed me twenty times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) reticule, <div class="bookquote">``I have
nothing here but documents, my dear Fitz Jarndyce; I must borrow a
pocket handkerchief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) one, and the good creature certainly made use of it,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) held it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) eyes with both hands and sat so, shedding
tears for the next ten minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure, my dear Fitz Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was careful to explain.
<div class="bookquote">``Not the least pain. Pleasure to see you well again. Pleasure at
having the honour of being admitted to see you. I am so much fonder
of you, my love, than of the Chancellor. Though I DO attend court
regularly. By the by, my dear, mentioning pocket handkerchiefs--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Flite here looked at Charley, who had been to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) at the
place where the coach stopped. Charley glanced at me and looked
unwilling to pursue the suggestion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ve-ry right!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite, <div class="bookquote">``Ve-ry correct. Truly! Highly
indiscreet of me to mention it; but my dear Miss Fitz Jarndyce, I am
afraid I am at times -LRB-between ourselves, you wouldn't think it-RRB- a
little--rambling you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite, touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you going to tell me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, smiling, for I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
wanted to go on. <div class="bookquote">``You have roused my curiosity, and now you must
gratify it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Flite looked at Charley for advice in this important crisis, who
said, <div class="bookquote">``If you please, ma'am, you had better tell then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>and therein
gratified Miss Flite beyond measure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So sagacious, our young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) to me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) mysterious
way. <div class="bookquote">``Diminutive. But ve-ry sagacious! Well, my dear, it's a pretty
anecdote. Nothing more. Still I think it charming. Who should follow
us down the road from the coach, my dear, but a poor person in a very
ungenteel bonnet--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, if you please, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Flite acquiesced with the greatest suavity. <div class="bookquote">``Jenny.
Ye-es! And what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) tell our young friend but that there has
been a lady with a veil inquiring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) cottage after my dear Fitz
Jarndyce's health and taking a handkerchief away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) as a little
keepsake merely because it was my amiable Fitz Jarndyce's! Now, you
know, so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley, to whom I looked in some
astonishment, <div class="bookquote">``Jenny says that when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) baby died, you left a
handkerchief there, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) put it away and kept it with the
baby's little things. I think, if you please, partly because it was
yours, miss, and partly because it had covered the baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Diminutive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>whispered Miss Flite, making a variety of motions about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) own forehead to express intellect in Charley. <div class="bookquote">``But exceedingly
sagacious! And so dear! My love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s clearer than any counsel I
ever heard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. <div class="bookquote">``I remember it. Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley, <div class="bookquote">``and that's the handkerchief the lady
took. And Jenny wants you to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) wouldn't have made away
with it herself for a heap of money but that the lady took it and
left some money instead. Jenny don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) at all, if you please,
miss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who can she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) be?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Miss Flite suggested, advancing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lips to my ear with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) most mysterious look, <div class="bookquote">``in MY opinion--don't mention this to our
diminutive friend--she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)'s the Lord Chancellor's wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)'s married,
you know. And I understand she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) leads him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) a terrible life. Throws his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>)
lordship's papers into the fire, my dear, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) won't pay the
jeweller!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I did not think very much about this lady then, for I had an
impression that it might be Caddy. Besides, my attention was diverted
by my visitor, who was cold after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ride and looked hungry and who,
our dinner being brought in, required some little assistance in
arraying herself with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and
a much-worn and often-mended pair of gloves, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had brought
down in a paper parcel. I had to preside, too, over the
entertainment, consisting of a dish of fish, a roast fowl, a
sweetbread, vegetables, pudding, and Madeira; and it was so pleasant
to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enjoyed it, and with what state and ceremony she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did
honour to it, that I was soon thinking of nothing else.

<p/>When we had finished and had our little dessert before us,
embellished by the hands of my dear, who would yield the
superintendence of everything prepared for me to no one, Miss Flite
was so very chatty and happy that I thought I would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
own history, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was always pleased to talk about herself. I began
by saying <div class="bookquote">``You have attended on the Lord Chancellor many years, Miss
Flite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, many, many, many years, my dear. But I expect a judgment.
Shortly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an anxiety even in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hopefulness that made me doubtful if
I had done right in approaching the subject. I thought I would say no
more about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father expected a judgment,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite. <div class="bookquote">``My brother. My
sister. They all expected a judgment. The same that I expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are all--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es. Dead of course, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>As I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would go on, I thought it best to try to be serviceable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by meeting the theme rather than avoiding it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not be wiser,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to expect this judgment no more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered promptly, <div class="bookquote">``of course it would!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to attend the court no more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Equally of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Very wearing to be always in
expectation of what never comes, my dear Fitz Jarndyce! Wearing, I
assure you, to the bone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slightly showed me her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm, and it was fearfully thin indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went on in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mysterious way, ``there's a
dreadful attraction in the place. Hush! Don't mention it to our
diminutive friend when she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) comes in. Or it may frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>). With
good reason. There's a cruel attraction in the place. You CAN<div class="bookquote">``T leave
it. And you MUST expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I tried to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that this was not so. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard me patiently
and smilingly, but was ready with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, aye! You think so because I am a little rambling. Ve-ry
absurd, to be a little rambling, is it not? Ve-ry confusing, too. To
the head. I find it so. But, my dear, I have been there many years,
and I have noticed. It's the mace and seal upon the table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What could they do, did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) think? I mildly asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Draw,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Flite. <div class="bookquote">``Draw people on, my dear. Draw peace out
of them. Sense out of them. Good looks out of them. Good qualities
out of them. I have felt them even drawing my rest away in the night.
Cold and glittering devils!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good-humouredly
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to
fear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke so gloomily, and confided these awful
secrets to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you my own case. Before they ever
drew me--before I had ever seen them--what was it I used to do?
Tambourine playing? No. Tambour work. I and my sister worked at
tambour work. Our father and our brother had a builder's business.
We all lived together. Ve-ry respectably, my dear! First, our father
was drawn--slowly. Home was drawn with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). In a few years he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was a fierce, sour, angry bankrupt without a kind word or a kind
look for any one. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been so different, Fitz Jarndyce. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was
drawn to a debtors' prison. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) died. Then our brother was
drawn--swiftly--to drunkenness. And rags. And death. Then my sister
was drawn. Hush! Never ask to what! Then I was ill and in misery, and
heard, as I had often heard before, that this was all the work of
Chancery. When I got better, I went to look at the monster. And then
I found out how it was, and I was drawn to stay there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Having got over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own short narrative, in the delivery of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had spoken in a low, strained voice, as if the shock were fresh upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gradually resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) usual air of amiable importance.

<p/>``You don't quite credit me, my dear! Well, well! You will, some day.
I am a little rambling. But I have noticed. I have seen many new
faces come, unsuspicious, within the influence of the mace and seal
in these many years. As my father's came there. As my brother's. As
my sister's. As my own. I hear Conversation Kenge and the rest of
them say to the new faces, ``Here's little Miss Flite. Oh, you are new
here; and you must come and be presented to little Miss Flite!<div class="bookquote">'' Ve-ry
good. Proud I am sure to have the honour! And we all laugh. But, Fitz
Jarndyce, I know what will happen. I know, far better than they do,
when the attraction has begun. I know the signs, my dear. I saw them
begin in Gridley. And I saw them end. Fitz Jarndyce, my love,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>speaking low again, <div class="bookquote">``I saw them beginning in our friend the ward in
Jarndyce. Let some one hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) back. Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)'ll be drawn to ruin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at me in silence for some moments, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face gradually
softening into a smile. Seeming to fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been too gloomy,
and seeming also to lose the connexion in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said politely
as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sipped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glass of wine, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, as I was saying, I
expect a judgment shortly. Then I shall release my birds, you know,
and confer estates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I was much impressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allusion to Richard and by the sad
meaning, so sadly illustrated in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poor pinched form, that made its
way through all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) incoherence. But happily for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was quite
complacent again now and beamed with nods and smiles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, gaily, reaching another hand to put it upon
mine. <div class="bookquote">``You have not congratulated me on my physician. Positively not
once, yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My physician, Mr. Woodcourt, my dear, who was so exceedingly
attentive to me. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) services were rendered quite
gratuitously. Until the Day of Judgment. I mean THE judgment that
will dissolve the spell upon me of the mace and seal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Woodcourt is so far away, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that I thought the time
for such congratulation was past, Miss Flite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``is it possible that you don't know
what has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not what everybody has been talking of, my beloved Fitz Jarndyce!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``You forget how long I have been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True! My dear, for the moment--true. I blame myself. But my memory
has been drawn out of me, with everything else, by what I mentioned.
Ve-ry strong influence, is it not? Well, my dear, there has been a
terrible shipwreck over in those East Indian seas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Woodcourt shipwrecked!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be agitated, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is safe. An awful scene. Death in all
shapes. Hundreds of dead and dying. Fire, storm, and darkness.
Numbers of the drowning thrown upon a rock. There, and through it
all, my dear physician was a hero. Calm and brave through everything.
Saved many lives, never complained in hunger and thirst, wrapped
naked people in his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) spare clothes, took the lead, showed them what to
do, governed them, tended the sick, buried the dead, and brought the
poor survivors safely off at last! My dear, the poor emaciated
creatures all but worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>). They fell down at his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) feet when
they got to the land and blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>). The whole country rings with
it. Stay! Where's my bag of documents? I have got it there, and you
shall read it, you shall read it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And I DID read all the noble history, though very slowly and
imperfectly then, for my eyes were so dimmed that I could not see the
words, and I cried so much that I was many times obliged to lay down
the long account she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had cut out of the newspaper. I felt so
triumphant ever to have known the man who had done such generous and
gallant deeds, I felt such glowing exultation in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) renown, I so
admired and loved what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done, that I envied the storm-worn
people who had fallen at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as their preserver.
I could myself have kneeled down then, so far away, and blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
in my rapture that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be so truly good and brave. I felt that
no one--mother, sister, wife--could honour him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than I. I did,
indeed!

<p/>My poor little visitor made me a present of the account, and when as
the evening began to close in she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rose to take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) leave, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
should miss the coach by which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was to return, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was still full
of the shipwreck, which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to
understand in all its details.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) carefully folded up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) scarf and gloves,
<div class="bookquote">``my brave physician ought to have a title bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>). And no
doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) will. You are of that opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) well deserved one, yes. That he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would ever have one, no.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, Fitz Jarndyce?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked rather sharply.

<p/>I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men
distinguished by peaceful services, however good and great, unless
occasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very
large amount of money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, good gracious,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite, <div class="bookquote">``how can you say that? Surely
you know, my dear, that all the greatest ornaments of England in
knowledge, imagination, active humanity, and improvement of every
sort are added to its nobility! Look round you, my dear, and
consider. YOU must be rambling a little now, I think, if you don't
know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the
land!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believed what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, for there were moments when
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very mad indeed.

<p/>And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to
keep. I had thought, sometimes, that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had been richer he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would perhaps have told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) loved me
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) went away. I had thought, sometimes, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had done
so, I should have been glad of it. But how much better it was now
that this had never happened! What should I have suffered if I had
had to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) that the poor face he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had known as
mine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
bondage to one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had never seen!

<p/>Oh, it was so much better as it was! With a great pang mercifully
spared me, I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had so brightly shown himself; and there was nothing to be undone:
no chain for me to break or for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) to drag; and I could go, please
God, my lowly way along the path of duty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could go his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nobler
way upon its broader road; and though we were apart upon the journey,
I might aspire to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), unselfishly, innocently, better far than
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had thought me when I found some favour in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes, at the
journey's end.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI

<p/>Chesney Wold


<p/>Charley and I did not set off alone upon our expedition into
Lincolnshire. My guardian had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mind not to lose sight of
me until I was safe in Mr. Boythorn's house, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) accompanied us,
and we were two days upon the road. I found every breath of air, and
every scent, and every flower and leaf and blade of grass, and every
passing cloud, and everything in nature, more beautiful and wonderful
to me than I had ever found it yet. This was my first gain from my
illness. How little I had lost, when the wide world was so full of
delight for me.

<p/>My guardian intending to go back immediately, we appointed, on our
way down, a day when my dear girl should come. I wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a letter,
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took charge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left us within half an hour of our
arrival at our destination, on a delightful evening in the early
summer-time.

<p/>If a good fairy had built the house for me with a wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) wand,
and I had been a princess and her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) favoured god-child, I could not
have been more considered in it. So many preparations were made for
me and such an endearing remembrance was shown of all my little
tastes and likings that I could have sat down, overcome, a dozen
times before I had revisited half the rooms. I did better than that,
however, by showing them all to Charley instead. Charley's delight
calmed mine; and after we had had a walk in the garden, and Charley
had exhausted her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) whole vocabulary of admiring expressions, I was as
tranquilly happy as I ought to have been. It was a great comfort to
be able to say to myself after tea, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, my dear, I think you are
quite sensible enough to sit down now and write a note of thanks to
your host.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had left a note of welcome for me, as sunny as his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) own
face, and had confided his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) bird to my care, which I knew to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
highest mark of confidence. Accordingly I wrote a little note to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
in London, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) how all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) favourite plants and trees were
looking, and how the most astonishing of birds had chirped the
honours of the house to me in the most hospitable manner, and how,
after singing on my shoulder, to the inconceivable rapture of my
little maid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was then at roost in the usual corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) cage,
but whether dreaming or no I could not report. My note finished and
sent off to the post, I made myself very busy in unpacking and
arranging; and I sent Charley to bed in good time and told her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) I
should want her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) no more that night.

<p/>For I had not yet looked in the glass and had never asked to have my
own restored to me. I knew this to be a weakness which must be
overcome, but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh
when I got to where I now was. Therefore I had wanted to be alone,
and therefore I said, now alone, in my own room, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, if you are
to be happy, if you are to have any right to pray to be true-hearted,
you must keep your word, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was quite resolved to keep it,
but I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my
blessings. And then I said my prayers and thought a little more.

<p/>My hair had not been cut off, though it had been in danger more than
once. It was long and thick. I let it down, and shook it out, and
went up to the glass upon the dressing-table. There was a little
muslin curtain drawn across it. I drew it back and stood for a moment
looking through such a veil of my own hair that I could see nothing
else. Then I put my hair aside and looked at the reflection in the
mirror, encouraged by seeing how placidly it looked at me. I was very
much changed--oh, very, very much. At first my face was so strange to
me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back
but for the encouragement I have mentioned. Very soon it became more
familiar, and then I knew the extent of the alteration in it better
than I had done at first. It was not like what I had expected, but I
had expected nothing definite, and I dare say anything definite would
have surprised me.

<p/>I had never been a beauty and had never thought myself one, but I had
been very different from this. It was all gone now. Heaven was so
good to me that I could let it go with a few not bitter tears and
could stand there arranging my hair for the night quite thankfully.

<p/>One thing troubled me, and I considered it for a long time before I
went to sleep. I had kept Mr. Woodcourt's flowers. When they were
withered I had dried them and put them in a book that I was fond of.
Nobody knew this, not even Ada. I was doubtful whether I had a right
to preserve what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had sent to one so different--whether it was
generous towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) to do it. I wished to be generous to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>), even
in the secret depths of my heart, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would never know, because
I could have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)--could have been devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). At last I
came to the conclusion that I might keep them if I treasured them
only as a remembrance of what was irrevocably past and gone, never to
be looked back on any more, in any other light. I hope this may not
seem trivial. I was very much in earnest.

<p/>I took care to be up early in the morning and to be before the glass
when Charley came in on tiptoe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>cried Charley, starting. <div class="bookquote">``Is that you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, quietly putting up my hair. <div class="bookquote">``And I am very
well indeed, and very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw it was a weight off Charley's mind, but it was a greater weight
off mine. I knew the worst now and was composed to it. I shall not
conceal, as I go on, the weaknesses I could not quite conquer, but
they always passed from me soon and the happier frame of mind stayed
by me faithfully.

<p/>Wishing to be fully re-established in my strength and my good spirits
before Ada came, I now laid down a little series of plans with
Charley for being in the fresh air all day long. We were to be out
before breakfast, and were to dine early, and were to be out again
before and after dinner, and were to talk in the garden after tea,
and were to go to rest betimes, and were to climb every hill and
explore every road, lane, and field in the neighbourhood. As to
restoratives and strengthening delicacies, Mr. Boythorn's good
housekeeper was for ever trotting about with something to eat or
drink in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hand; I could not even be heard of as resting in the
park but she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would come trotting after me with a basket, her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) cheerful
face shining with a lecture on the importance of frequent
nourishment. Then there was a pony expressly for my riding, a chubby
pony with a short neck and a mane all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) eyes who could
canter--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) would--so easily and quietly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) was a treasure.
In a very few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) would come to me in the paddock when I called
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>), and eat out of my hand, and follow me about. We arrived at such
a capital understanding that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) was jogging with me lazily, and
rather obstinately, down some shady lane, if I patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) neck and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Stubbs, I am surprised you don't canter when you know how much
I like it; and I think you might oblige me, for you are only getting
stupid and going to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) would give his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) head a comical shake or
two and set off directly, while Charley would stand still and laugh
with such enjoyment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) laughter was like music. I don't know
who had given Stubbs his (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) name, but it seemed to belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) as
naturally as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) rough coat. Once we put him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) in a little chaise and
drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) triumphantly through the green lanes for five miles; but
all at once, as we were extolling him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) to the skies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) seemed to take
it ill that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) should have been accompanied so far by the circle of
tantalizing little gnats that had been hovering round and round his (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>)
ears the whole way without appearing to advance an inch, and stopped
to think about it. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) came to the decision that it was not
to be borne, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) steadily refused to move until I gave the reins
to Charley and got out and walked, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) followed me with a sturdy
sort of good humour, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) head under my arm and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
ear against my sleeve. It was in vain for me to say, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Stubbs, I
feel quite sure from what I know of you that you will go on if I ride
a little while,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>for the moment I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) stood stock still
again. Consequently I was obliged to lead the way, as before; and in
this order we returned home, to the great delight of the village.

<p/>Charley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages, I
am sure, for in a week's time the people were so glad to see us go
by, though ever so frequently in the course of a day, that there were
faces of greeting in every cottage. I had known many of the grown
people before and almost all the children, but now the very steeple
began to wear a familiar and affectionate look. Among my new friends
was an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and
whitewashed dwelling that when the outside shutter was turned up on
its hinges, it shut up the whole house-front. This old lady had a
grandson who was a sailor, and I wrote a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and
drew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
up and where his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) old stool yet occupied its old place. This was
considered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the
world, but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) mentioned that he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was going to take the picture all the way
to America, and from America would write again, I got all the credit
that ought to have been given to the post-office and was invested
with the merit of the whole system.

<p/>Thus, what with being so much in the air, playing with so many
children, gossiping with so many people, sitting on invitation in so
many cottages, going on with Charley's education, and writing long
letters to Ada every day, I had scarcely any time to think about that
little loss of mine and was almost always cheerful. If I did think of
it at odd moments now and then, I had only to be busy and forget it.
I felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said,
<div class="bookquote">``Mother, why is the lady not a pretty lady now like she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div>But when I found the child was not less fond of me, and drew its soft
hand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch,
that soon set me up again. There were many little occurrences which
suggested to me, with great consolation, how natural it is to gentle
hearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority. One of
these particularly touched me. I happened to stroll into the little
church when a marriage was just concluded, and the young couple had
to sign the register.

<p/>The bridegroom, to whom the pen was handed first, made a rude cross
for his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) mark; the bride, who came next, did the same. Now, I had
known the bride when I was last there, not only as the prettiest girl
in the place, but as having quite distinguished herself in the
school, and I could not help looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with some surprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
came aside and whispered to me, while tears of honest love and
admiration stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bright eyes, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>)'s a dear good fellow, miss;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) can't write yet--he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>)'s going to learn of me--and I wouldn't
shame him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) for the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Why, what had I to fear, I thought, when
there was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man's daughter!

<p/>The air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it had ever blown,
and the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my
old one. Charley was wonderful to see, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was so radiant and so
rosy; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole
night.

<p/>There was a favourite spot of mine in the park-woods of Chesney Wold
where a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view. The wood had
been cleared and opened to improve this point of sight, and the
bright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at
least once every day. A picturesque part of the Hall, called the
Ghost's Walk, was seen to advantage from this higher ground; and the
startling name, and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had
heard from Mr. Boythorn accounting for it, mingled with the view and
gave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real
charms. There was a bank here, too, which was a famous one for
violets; and as it was a daily delight of Charley's to gather wild
flowers, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took as much to the spot as I did.

<p/>It would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house
or never went inside it. The family were not there, I had heard on my
arrival, and were not expected. I was far from being incurious or
uninterested about the building; on the contrary, I often sat in this
place wondering how the rooms ranged and whether any echo like a
footstep really did resound at times, as the story said, upon the
lonely Ghost's Walk. The indefinable feeling with which Lady Dedlock
had impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the
house even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was absent. I am not sure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) face and figure
were associated with it, naturally; but I cannot say that they
repelled me from it, though something did. For whatever reason or no
reason, I had never once gone near it, down to the day at which my
story now arrives.

<p/>I was resting at my favourite point after a long ramble, and Charley
was gathering violets at a little distance from me. I had been
looking at the Ghost's Walk lying in a deep shade of masonry afar off
and picturing to myself the female shape that was said to haunt it
when I became aware of a figure approaching through the wood. The
perspective was so long and so darkened by leaves, and the shadows of
the branches on the ground made it so much more intricate to the eye,
that at first I could not discern what figure it was. By little and
little it revealed itself to be a woman's--a lady's--Lady Dedlock's.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was alone and coming to where I sat with a much quicker step, I
observed to my surprise, than was usual with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>).

<p/>I was fluttered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) being unexpectedly so near -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was almost
within speaking distance before I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)-RRB- and would have risen to
continue my walk. But I could not. I was rendered motionless. Not so
much by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hurried gesture of entreaty, not so much by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) quick
advance and outstretched hands, not so much by the great change in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) manner and the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) haughty self-restraint, as by a
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) face that I had pined for and dreamed of when I was
a little child, something I had never seen in any face, something I
had never seen in hers before.

<p/>A dread and faintness fell upon me, and I called to Charley. Lady
Dedlock stopped upon the instant and changed back almost to what I
had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson, I am afraid I have startled you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) said, now
advancing slowly. <div class="bookquote">``You can scarcely be strong yet. You have been very
ill, I know. I have been much concerned to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could no more have removed my eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) pale face than I could
have stirred from the bench on which I sat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand, and
its deadly coldness, so at variance with the enforced composure of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) features, deepened the fascination that overpowered me. I cannot
say what was in my whirling thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are recovering again?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) asked kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was quite well but a moment ago, Lady Dedlock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this your young attendant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you send her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) on before and walk towards your house with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``take your flowers home, and I will follow you
directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) best curtsy, blushingly tied on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) bonnet and went
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) way. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was gone, Lady Dedlock sat down on the seat beside
me.

<p/>I cannot tell in any words what the state of my mind was when I saw
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand my handkerchief with which I had covered the dead baby.

<p/>I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), but I could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), I could not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), I
could not draw my breath. The beating of my heart was so violent and
wild that I felt as if my life were breaking from me. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
caught me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) breast, kissed me, wept over me, compassionated me,
and called me back to myself; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) fell down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) knees and
cried to me, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my child, my child, I am your wicked and unhappy
mother! Oh, try to forgive me!'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>--when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) at my feet on the
bare earth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) great agony of mind, I felt, through all my tumult
of emotion, a burst of gratitude to the providence of God that I was
so changed as that I never could disgrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) by any trace of
likeness, as that nobody could ever now look at me and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
and remotely think of any near tie between us.

<p/>I raised my mother up, praying and beseeching her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not to stoop before
me in such affliction and humiliation. I did so in broken, incoherent
words, for besides the trouble I was in, it frightened me to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
at MY feet. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)--or I tried to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)--that if it were for
me, her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) child, under any circumstances to take upon me to forgive
her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), I did it, and had done it, many, many years. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) that my
heart overflowed with love for her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), that it was natural love which
nothing in the past had changed or could change. That it was not for
me, then resting for the first time on my mother's bosom, to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
to account for having given me life, but that my duty was to bless
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and receive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), though the whole world turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that
I only asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leave to do it. I held my mother in my embrace, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) held me in hers, and among the still woods in the silence of the
summer day there seemed to be nothing but our two troubled minds that
was not at peace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To bless and receive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>groaned my mother, <div class="bookquote">``it is far too late. I
must travel my dark road alone, and it will lead me where it will.
From day to day, sometimes from hour to hour, I do not see the way
before my guilty feet. This is the earthly punishment I have brought
upon myself. I bear it, and I hide it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Even in the thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) endurance, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) habitual air of
proud indifference about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) like a veil, though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soon cast it off
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must keep this secret, if by any means it can be kept, not wholly
for myself. I have a husband, wretched and dishonouring creature that
I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>These words she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uttered with a suppressed cry of despair, more
terrible in its sound than any shriek. Covering her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shrank down in my embrace as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were unwilling that I
should touch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); nor could I, by my utmost persuasions or by any
endearments I could use, prevail upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to rise. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, no, no,
no, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could only speak to me so; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must be proud and disdainful
everywhere else; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be humbled and ashamed there, in the only
natural moments of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life.

<p/>My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been nearly
frantic. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had but then known that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child was living. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
not have suspected me to be that child before. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had followed me
down here to speak to me but once in all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life. We never could
associate, never could communicate, never probably from that time
forth could interchange another word on earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put into my hands
a letter she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had written for my reading only and said when I had read
it and destroyed it--but not so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sake, since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked
nothing, as for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband's and my own--I must evermore consider
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as dead. If I could believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved me, in this agony in
which I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), with a mother's love, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked me to do that, for
then I might think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with a greater pity, imagining what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
suffered. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had put herself beyond all hope and beyond all help.
Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) secret until death or it came to be
discovered and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brought dishonour and disgrace upon the name she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had taken, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) solitary struggle always; and no affection
could come near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and no human creature could render her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) any aid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But is the secret safe so far?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``Is it safe now, dearest
mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied my mother. <div class="bookquote">``It has been very near discovery. It was
saved by an accident. It may be lost by another accident--to-morrow,
any day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you dread a particular person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Do not tremble and cry so much for me. I am not worthy of
these tears,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said my mother, kissing my hands. <div class="bookquote">``I dread one person
very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An enemy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a friend. One who is too passionless to be either. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is Sir

woods of Chesney Wold had closed around the house, but my course
through it is the same. I have but one; I can have but one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was beginning when my mother hurriedly inquired,
<div class="bookquote">``Does HE (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) suspect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! Be assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) does not!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>And I told
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had related to me as his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knowledge of my story. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
is so good and sensible,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) knew--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My mother, who until this time had made no change in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) position,
raised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand up to my lips and stopped me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confide fully in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said after a little while. <div class="bookquote">``You have my
free consent--a small gift from such a mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) injured
child!--but do not tell me of it. Some pride is left in me even yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I explained, as nearly as I could then, or can recall now--for my
agitation and distress throughout were so great that I scarcely
understood myself, though every word that was uttered in the mother's
voice, so unfamiliar and so melancholy to me, which in my childhood I
had never learned to love and recognize, had never been sung to sleep
with, had never heard a blessing from, had never had a hope inspired
by, made an enduring impression on my memory--I say I explained, or
tried to do it, how I had only hoped that Mr. Jarndyce, who had been
the best of fathers to me, might be able to afford some counsel and
support to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But my mother answered no, it was impossible; no one
could help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Through the desert that lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must go
alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child, my child!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``For the last time! These kisses for
the last time! These arms upon my neck for the last time! We shall
meet no more. To hope to do what I seek to do, I must be what I have
been so long. Such is my reward and doom. If you hear of Lady
Dedlock, brilliant, prosperous, and flattered, think of your wretched
mother, conscience-stricken, underneath that mask! Think that the
reality is in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffering, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) useless remorse, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) murdering
within her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast the only love and truth of which it is capable! And
then forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) if you can, and cry to heaven to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), which
it never can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>We held one another for a little space yet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was so firm that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took my hands away, and put them back against my breast, and with
a last kiss as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) held them there, released them, and went from me
into the wood. I was alone, and calm and quiet below me in the sun
and shade lay the old house, with its terraces and turrets, on which
there had seemed to me to be such complete repose when I first saw
it, but which now looked like the obdurate and unpitying watcher of
my mother's misery.

<p/>Stunned as I was, as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in
my sick chamber, the necessity of guarding against the danger of
discovery, or even of the remotest suspicion, did me service. I took
such precautions as I could to hide from Charley that I had been
crying, and I constrained myself to think of every sacred obligation
that there was upon me to be careful and collected. It was not a
little while before I could succeed or could even restrain bursts of
grief, but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might
return. I went home very slowly and told Charley, whom I found at the
gate looking for me, that I had been tempted to extend my walk after
Lady Dedlock had left me and that I was over-tired and would lie
down. Safe in my own room, I read the letter. I clearly derived from
it--and that was much then--that I had not been abandoned by my
mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) elder and only sister, the godmother of my childhood,
discovering signs of life in me when I had been laid aside as dead,
had in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stern sense of duty, with no desire or willingness that I
should live, reared me in rigid secrecy and had never again beheld my
mother's face from within a few hours of my birth. So strangely did I
hold my place in this world that until within a short time back I had
never, to my own mother's knowledge, breathed--had been buried--had
never been endowed with life--had never borne a name. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
first seen me in the church she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been startled and had thought of
what would have been like me if it had ever lived, and had lived on,
but that was all then.

<p/>What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here. It has
its own times and places in my story.

<p/>My first care was to burn what my mother had written and to consume
even its ashes. I hope it may not appear very unnatural or bad in me
that I then became heavily sorrowful to think I had ever been reared.
That I felt as if I knew it would have been better and happier for
many people if indeed I had never breathed. That I had a terror of
myself as the danger and the possible disgrace of my own mother and
of a proud family name. That I was so confused and shaken as to be
possessed by a belief that it was right and had been intended that I
should die in my birth, and that it was wrong and not intended that I
should be then alive.

<p/>These are the real feelings that I had. I fell asleep worn out, and
when I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world
with my load of trouble for others. I was more than ever frightened
of myself, thinking anew of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) against whom I was a witness, of the
owner of Chesney Wold, of the new and terrible meaning of the old
words now moaning in my ear like a surge upon the shore, <div class="bookquote">``Your
mother, Esther, was your disgrace, and you are hers. The time will
come--and soon enough--when you will understand this better, and will
feel it too, as no one save a woman can.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chesney Wold</b></font>)</div>With them, those other
words returned, <div class="bookquote">``Pray daily that the sins of others be not visited
upon your head.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not disentangle all that was about me, and I
felt as if the blame and the shame were all in me, and the visitation
had come down.

<p/>The day waned into a gloomy evening, overcast and sad, and I still
contended with the same distress. I went out alone, and after walking
a little in the park, watching the dark shades falling on the trees
and the fitful flight of the bats, which sometimes almost touched me,
was attracted to the house for the first time. Perhaps I might not
have gone near it if I had been in a stronger frame of mind. As it
was, I took the path that led close by it.

<p/>I did not dare to linger or to look up, but I passed before the
terrace garden with its fragrant odours, and its broad walks, and its
well-kept beds and smooth turf; and I saw how beautiful and grave it
was, and how the old stone balustrades and parapets, and wide flights
of shallow steps, were seamed by time and weather; and how the
trained moss and ivy grew about them, and around the old stone
pedestal of the sun-dial; and I heard the fountain falling. Then the
way went by long lines of dark windows diversified by turreted towers
and porches of eccentric shapes, where old stone lions and grotesque
monsters bristled outside dens of shadow and snarled at the evening
gloom over the escutcheons they held in their grip. Thence the path
wound underneath a gateway, and through a court-yard where the
principal entrance was -LRB-I hurried quickly on-RRB-, and by the stables
where none but deep voices seemed to be, whether in the murmuring of
the wind through the strong mass of ivy holding to a high red wall,
or in the low complaining of the weathercock, or in the barking of
the dogs, or in the slow striking of a clock. So, encountering
presently a sweet smell of limes, whose rustling I could hear, I
turned with the turning of the path to the south front, and there
above me were the balustrades of the Ghost's Walk and one lighted
window that might be my mother's.

<p/>The way was paved here, like the terrace overhead, and my footsteps
from being noiseless made an echoing sound upon the flags. Stopping
to look at nothing, but seeing all I did see as I went, I was passing
quickly on, and in a few moments should have passed the lighted
window, when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind
that there was a dreadful truth in the legend of the Ghost's Walk,
that it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and
that my warning feet were haunting it even then. Seized with an
augmented terror of myself which turned me cold, I ran from myself
and everything, retraced the way by which I had come, and never
paused until I had gained the lodge-gate, and the park lay sullen and
black behind me.

<p/>Not before I was alone in my own room for the night and had again
been dejected and unhappy there did I begin to know how wrong and
thankless this state was. But from my darling who was coming on the
morrow, I found a joyful letter, full of such loving anticipation
that I must have been of marble if it had not moved me; from my
guardian, too, I found another letter, asking me to tell Dame Durden,
if I should see that little woman anywhere, that they had moped most
pitiably without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that the housekeeping was going to rack and
ruin, that nobody else could manage the keys, and that everybody in
and about the house declared it was not the same house and was
becoming rebellious for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) return. Two such letters together made me
think how far beyond my deserts I was beloved and how happy I ought
to be. That made me think of all my past life; and that brought me,
as it ought to have done before, into a better condition.

<p/>For I saw very well that I could not have been intended to die, or I
should never have lived; not to say should never have been reserved
for such a happy life. I saw very well how many things had worked
together for my welfare, and that if the sins of the fathers were
sometimes visited upon the children, the phrase did not mean what I
had in the morning feared it meant. I knew I was as innocent of my
birth as a queen of hers and that before my Heavenly Father I should
not be punished for birth nor a queen rewarded for it. I had had
experience, in the shock of that very day, that I could, even thus
soon, find comforting reconcilements to the change that had fallen on
me. I renewed my resolutions and prayed to be strengthened in them,
pouring out my heart for myself and for my unhappy mother and feeling
that the darkness of the morning was passing away. It was not upon my
sleep; and when the next day's light awoke me, it was gone.

<p/>My dear girl was to arrive at five o'clock in the afternoon. How to
help myself through the intermediate time better than by taking a
long walk along the road by which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was to come, I did not know; so
Charley and I and Stubbs--Stubbs saddled, for we never drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>)
after the one great occasion--made a long expedition along that road
and back. On our return, we held a great review of the house and
garden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition, and
had the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment.

<p/>There were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could
come, and in that interval, which seemed a long one, I must confess I
was nervously anxious about my altered looks. I loved my darling so
well that I was more concerned for their effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) than on any
one. I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am
quite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) be
wholly prepared? When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first saw me, might she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not be a little
shocked and disappointed? Might it not prove a little worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
expected? Might she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not look for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) old Esther and not find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?
Might she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again?

<p/>I knew the various expressions of my sweet girl's face so well, and
it was such an honest face in its loveliness, that I was sure
beforehand she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not hide that first look from me. And I
considered whether, if it should signify any one of these meanings,
which was so very likely, could I quite answer for myself?

<p/>Well, I thought I could. After last night, I thought I could. But to
wait and wait, and expect and expect, and think and think, was such
bad preparation that I resolved to go along the road again and meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>So I said to Charley, <div class="bookquote">``Charley, I will go by myself and walk along
the road until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>Charley highly approving of anything that
pleased me, I went and left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at home.

<p/>But before I got to the second milestone, I had been in so many
palpitations from seeing dust in the distance -LRB-though I knew it was
not, and could not, be the coach yet-RRB- that I resolved to turn back
and go home again. And when I had turned, I was in such fear of the
coach coming up behind me -LRB-though I still knew that it neither would,
nor could, do any such thing-RRB- that I ran the greater part of the way
to avoid being overtaken.

<p/>Then, I considered, when I had got safe back again, this was a nice
thing to have done! Now I was hot and had made the worst of it
instead of the best.

<p/>At last, when I believed there was at least a quarter of an hour more
yet, Charley all at once cried out to me as I was trembling in the
garden, <div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes, miss! Here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I did not mean to do it, but I ran upstairs into my room and hid
myself behind the door. There I stood trembling, even when I heard my
darling calling as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came upstairs, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, my dear, my love,
where are you? Little woman, dear Dame Durden!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ran in, and was running out again when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) saw me. Ah, my angel
girl! The old dear look, all love, all fondness, all affection.
Nothing else in it--no, nothing, nothing!

<p/>Oh, how happy I was, down upon the floor, with my sweet beautiful
girl down upon the floor too, holding my scarred face to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lovely
cheek, bathing it with tears and kisses, rocking me to and fro like a
child, calling me by every tender name that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could think of, and
pressing me to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) faithful heart.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII

<p/>Jarndyce and Jarndyce


<p/>If the secret I had to keep had been mine, I must have confided it to
Ada before we had been long together. But it was not mine, and I did
not feel that I had a right to tell it, even to my guardian, unless
some great emergency arose. It was a weight to bear alone; still my
present duty appeared to be plain, and blest in the attachment of my
dear, I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it. Though
often when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was asleep and all was quiet, the remembrance of my
mother kept me waking and made the night sorrowful, I did not yield
to it at another time; and Ada found me what I used to be--except, of
course, in that particular of which I have said enough and which I
have no intention of mentioning any more just now, if I can help it.

<p/>The difficulty that I felt in being quite composed that first evening
when Ada asked me, over our work, if the family were at the house,
and when I was obliged to answer yes, I believed so, for Lady Dedlock
had spoken to me in the woods the day before yesterday, was great.
Greater still when Ada asked me what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had said, and when I replied
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had been kind and interested, and when Ada, while admitting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) beauty and elegance, remarked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) proud manner and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
imperious chilling air. But Charley helped me through, unconsciously,
by telling us that Lady Dedlock had only stayed at the house two
nights on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) way from London to visit at some other great house in
the next county and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) had left early on the morning after we
had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) at our view, as we called it. Charley verified the adage
about little pitchers, I am sure, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) heard of more sayings and
doings in a day than would have come to my ears in a month.

<p/>We were to stay a month at Mr. Boythorn's. My pet had scarcely been
there a bright week, as I recollect the time, when one evening after
we had finished helping the gardener in watering his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) flowers, and
just as the candles were lighted, Charley, appearing with a very
important air behind Ada's chair, beckoned me mysteriously out of the
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! If you please, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley in a whisper, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) eyes
at their roundest and largest. <div class="bookquote">``You're wanted at the Dedlock Arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``who can possibly want me at the
public-house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>returned Charley, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head forward and
folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hands tight upon the band of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) little apron, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
always did in the enjoyment of anything mysterious or confidential,
<div class="bookquote">``but it's a gentleman, miss, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) compliments, and will you please
to come without saying anything about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose compliments, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)`n, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>returned Charley, whose grammatical education was
advancing, but not very rapidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you come to be the messenger, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not the messenger, if you please, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>maid</b></font>)</div>returned my little
maid. <div class="bookquote">``It was W. Grubble, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is W. Grubble, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mister Grubble, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>returned Charley. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know, miss? The
Dedlock Arms, by W. Grubble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>which Charley delivered as if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) were
slowly spelling out the sign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye? The landlord, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss. If you please, miss, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) wife is a beautiful woman, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) broke her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ankle, and it never joined. And her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother's the
sawyer that was put in the cage, miss, and they expect he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'ll drink
himself to death entirely on beer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley.

<p/>Not knowing what might be the matter, and being easily apprehensive
now, I thought it best to go to this place by myself. I bade Charley
be quick with my bonnet and veil and my shawl, and having put them
on, went away down the little hilly street, where I was as much at
home as in Mr. Boythorn's garden.

<p/>Mr. Grubble was standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) shirt-sleeves at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) very
clean little tavern waiting for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) lifted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) hat with both
hands when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) saw me coming, and carrying it so, as if it were an
iron vessel -LRB-it looked as heavy-RRB-, preceded me along the sanded
passage to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) best parlour, a neat carpeted room with more plants in
it than were quite convenient, a coloured print of Queen Caroline,
several shells, a good many tea-trays, two stuffed and dried fish in
glass cases, and either a curious egg or a curious pumpkin -LRB-but I
don't know which, and I doubt if many people did-RRB- hanging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>)
ceiling. I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) often
standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) door. A pleasant-looking, stoutish, middle-aged man
who never seemed to consider himself cozily dressed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) own
fire-side without his (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) hat and top-boots, but who never wore a coat
except at church.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) snuffed the candle, and backing away a little to see how it
looked, backed out of the room--unexpectedly to me, for I was going
to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grubble</b></font>) had been sent. The door of the opposite parlour
being then opened, I heard some voices, familiar in my ears I
thought, which stopped. A quick light step approached the room in
which I was, and who should stand before me but Richard!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My best friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) really was so
warm-hearted and earnest that in the first surprise and pleasure of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) brotherly greeting I could scarcely find breath to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) that
Ada was well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Answering my very thoughts--always the same dear girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said
Richard, leading me to a chair and seating himself beside me.

<p/>I put my veil up, but not quite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always the same dear girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard just as heartily as before.

<p/>I put up my veil altogether, and laying my hand on Richard's sleeve
and looking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) how much I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) kind
welcome and how greatly I rejoiced to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), the more so because of
the determination I had made in my illness, which I now conveyed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``there is no one with whom I have a greater
wish to talk than you, for I want you to understand me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I want you, Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, shaking my head, <div class="bookquote">``to understand
some one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you refer so immediately to John Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">''--I
suppose you mean him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I may say at once that I am glad of it, because it is on that
subject that I am anxious to be understood. By you, mind--you, my
dear! I am not accountable to Mr. Jarndyce or Mr. Anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was pained to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) taking this tone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) observed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``we won't go into that now. I
want to appear quietly in your country-house here, with you under my
arm, and give my charming cousin a surprise. I suppose your loyalty
to John Jarndyce will allow that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``you know you would be heartily
welcome at his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) house--your home, if you will but consider it so; and
you are as heartily welcome here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Spoken like the best of little women!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard gaily.

<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) profession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I like it well enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``It's all right. It does
as well as anything else, for a time. I don't know that I shall care
about it when I come to be settled, but I can sell out then
and--however, never mind all that botheration at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So young and handsome, and in all respects so perfectly the opposite
of Miss Flite! And yet, in the clouded, eager, seeking look that
passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), so dreadfully like her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in town on leave just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have run over to look after my--my Chancery interests before
the long vacation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, forcing a careless laugh. <div class="bookquote">``We are
beginning to spin along with that old suit at last, I promise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>No wonder that I shook my head!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you say, it's not a pleasant subject.''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>Richard spoke with the
same shade crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face as before. <div class="bookquote">``Let it go to the four winds
for to-night. Puff! Gone! Who do you suppose is with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it Mr. Skimpole's voice I heard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the man! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does me more good than anybody. What a
fascinating child it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I asked Richard if any one knew of their coming down together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
answered, no, nobody. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had been to call upon the dear old
infant--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) called Mr. Skimpole--and the dear old infant had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) where we were, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had told the dear old infant he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was bent on
coming to see us, and the dear old infant had directly wanted to come
too; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is worth--not to say his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sordid expenses--but thrice his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weight in gold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
such a cheery fellow. No worldliness about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Fresh and
green-hearted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I certainly did not see the proof of Mr. Skimpole's worldliness in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) having his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) expenses paid by Richard, but I made no remark about
that. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) came in and turned our conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was charmed
to see me, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had been shedding delicious tears of joy and
sympathy at intervals for six weeks on my account, had never been so
happy as in hearing of my progress, began to understand the mixture
of good and evil in the world now, felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) appreciated health
the more when somebody else was ill, didn't know but what it might be
in the scheme of things that A should squint to make B happier in
looking straight or that C should carry a wooden leg to make D better
satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) flesh and blood in a silk stocking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson, here is our friend Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Skimpole, ``full of the brightest visions of the future, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
evokes out of the darkness of Chancery. Now that's delightful, that's
inspiriting, that's full of poetry! In old times the woods and
solitudes were made joyous to the shepherd by the imaginary piping
and dancing of Pan and the nymphs. This present shepherd, our
pastoral Richard, brightens the dull Inns of Court by making Fortune
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) train sport through them to the melodious notes of a judgment
from the bench. That's very pleasant, you know! Some ill-conditioned
growling fellow may say to me, ``What's the use of these legal and
equitable abuses? How do you defend them?'' I reply, ``My growling
friend, I DON<div class="bookquote">``T defend them, but they are very agreeable to me. There
is a shepherd--youth, a friend of mine, who transmutes them into
something highly fascinating to my simplicity. I don't say it is for
this that they exist--for I am a child among you worldly grumblers,
and not called upon to account to you or myself for anything--but it
may be so.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I began seriously to think that Richard could scarcely have found a
worse friend than this. It made me uneasy that at such a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
most required some right principle and purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) should have this
captivating looseness and putting-off of everything, this airy
dispensing with all principle and purpose, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) elbow. I thought I
could understand how such a nature as my guardian's, experienced in
the world and forced to contemplate the miserable evasions and
contentions of the family misfortune, found an immense relief in Mr.
Skimpole's avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) weaknesses and display of guileless candour;
but I could not satisfy myself that it was as artless as it seemed or
that it did not serve Mr. Skimpole's idle turn quite as well as any
other part, and with less trouble.

<p/>They both walked back with me, and Mr. Skimpole leaving us at the
gate, I walked softly in with Richard and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ada, my love, I have
brought a gentleman to visit you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>It was not difficult to read the
blushing, startled face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) dearly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) knew it, and I
knew it. It was a very transparent business, that meeting as cousins
only.

<p/>I almost mistrusted myself as growing quite wicked in my suspicions,
but I was not so sure that Richard loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) dearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
very much--any one must have done that--and I dare say would have
renewed their youthful engagement with great pride and ardour but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) promise to my guardian. Still
I had a tormenting idea that the influence upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) extended even
here, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was postponing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) best truth and earnestness in this
as in all things until Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) mind.
Ah me! What Richard would have been without that blight, I never
shall know now!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) told Ada, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) most ingenuous way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had not come to make
any secret inroad on the terms she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had accepted -LRB-rather too
implicitly and confidingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) thought-RRB- from Mr. Jarndyce, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
had come openly to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and to see me and to justify himself for
the present terms on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) stood with Mr. Jarndyce. As the dear
old infant would be with us directly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) begged that I would make an
appointment for the morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) might set himself right through
the means of an unreserved conversation with me. I proposed to walk
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) in the park at seven o'clock, and this was arranged. Mr.
Skimpole soon afterwards appeared and made us merry for an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
particularly requested to see little Coavinses -LRB-meaning Charley-RRB- and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), with a patriarchal air, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) late father
all the business in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) power and that if one of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) little brothers
would make haste to get set up in the same profession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
should still be able to put a good deal of employment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For I am constantly being taken in these nets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole,
looking beamingly at us over a glass of wine-and-water, <div class="bookquote">``and am
constantly being bailed out--like a boat. Or paid off--like a ship's
company. Somebody always does it for me. I can't do it, you know, for
I never have any money. But somebody does it. I get out by somebody's
means; I am not like the starling; I get out. If you were to ask me
who somebody is, upon my word I couldn't tell you. Let us drink to
somebody. God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard was a little late in the morning, but I had not to wait for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) long, and we turned into the park. The air was bright and dewy
and the sky without a cloud. The birds sang delightfully; the
sparkles in the fern, the grass, and trees, were exquisite to see;
the richness of the woods seemed to have increased twenty-fold since
yesterday, as if, in the still night when they had looked so
massively hushed in sleep, Nature, through all the minute details of
every wonderful leaf, had been more wakeful than usual for the glory
of that day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a lovely place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, looking round. <div class="bookquote">``None of the
jar and discord of law-suits here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was other trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what, my dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``when I get affairs in
general settled, I shall come down here, I think, and rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not be better to rest now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, as to resting NOW,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``or as to doing anything very
definite NOW, that's not easy. In short, it can't be done; I can't do
it at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know why not, Esther. If you were living in an unfinished house,
liable to have the roof put on or taken off--to be from top to bottom
pulled down or built up--to-morrow, next day, next week, next month,
next year--you would find it hard to rest or settle. So do I. Now?
There's no now for us suitors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I could almost have believed in the attraction on which my poor
little wandering friend had expatiated when I saw again the darkened
look of last night. Terrible to think it had in it also a shade of
that unfortunate man who had died.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``this is a bad beginning of our
conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you would tell me so, Dame Durden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not I alone, dear Richard. It was not I who cautioned you once
never to found a hope or expectation on the family curse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you come back to John Jarndyce!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard impatiently.
<div class="bookquote">``Well! We must approach him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) sooner or later, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is the staple of
what I have to say, and it's as well at once. My dear Esther, how can
you be so blind? Don't you see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is an interested party and
that it may be very well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to wish me to know nothing of the
suit, and care nothing about it, but that it may not be quite so well
for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated, <div class="bookquote">``is it possible that you can ever have
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), that you can ever have lived under his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) roof
and known him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), and can yet breathe, even to me in this solitary place
where there is no one to hear us, such unworthy suspicions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) reddened deeply, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) natural generosity felt a pang of
reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was silent for a little while before he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) replied in a
subdued voice, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, I am sure you know that I am not a mean
fellow and that I have some sense of suspicion and distrust being
poor qualities in one of my years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I am not more sure of anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>retorted Richard, <div class="bookquote">``and like you, because it
gives me comfort. I had need to get some scrap of comfort out of all
this business, for it's a bad one at the best, as I have no occasion
to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know perfectly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I know as well, Richard--what shall I
say? as well as you do--that such misconstructions are foreign to
your nature. And I know, as well as you know, what so changes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, sister, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard a little more gaily, <div class="bookquote">``you will be
fair with me at all events. If I have the misfortune to be under that
influence, so has he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). If it has a little twisted me, it may have a
little twisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) too. I don't say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is not an honourable man,
out of all this complication and uncertainty; I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is. But it
taints everybody. You know it taints everybody. You have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
say so fifty times. Then why should HE (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) escape?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is an uncommon character, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has
resolutely kept himself outside the circle, Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, because and because!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>replied Richard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) vivacious way. <div class="bookquote">``I
am not sure, my dear girl, but that it may be wise and specious to
preserve that outward indifference. It may cause other parties
interested to become lax about their interests; and people may die
off, and points may drag themselves out of memory, and many things
may smoothly happen that are convenient enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was so touched with pity for Richard that I could not reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
any more, even by a look. I remembered my guardian's gentleness
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) errors and with what perfect freedom from resentment he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
had spoken of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>Richard resumed, <div class="bookquote">``you are not to suppose that I have come
here to make underhanded charges against John Jarndyce. I have only
come to justify myself. What I say is, it was all very well and we
got on very well while I was a boy, utterly regardless of this same
suit; but as soon as I began to take an interest in it and to look
into it, then it was quite another thing. Then John Jarndyce
discovers that Ada and I must break off and that if I don't amend
that very objectionable course, I am not fit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). Now, Esther, I
don't mean to amend that very objectionable course: I will not hold
John Jarndyce's favour on those unfair terms of compromise, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
has no right to dictate. Whether it pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) or displeases him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), I
must maintain my rights and Ada's. I have been thinking about it a
good deal, and this is the conclusion I have come to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor dear Richard! He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had indeed been thinking about it a good deal.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) manner, all showed that too plainly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) honourably -LRB-you are to know I have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
about all this-RRB- that we are at issue and that we had better be at
issue openly than covertly. I thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) goodwill and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
protection, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) goes his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) road, and I go mine. The fact is, our
roads are not the same. Under one of the wills in dispute, I should
take much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). I don't mean to say that it is the one to be
established, but there it is, and it has its chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not to learn from you, my dear Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``of your
letter. I had heard of it already without an offended or angry word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>replied Richard, softening. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was an
honourable man, out of all this wretched affair. But I always say
that and have never doubted it. Now, my dear Esther, I know these
views of mine appear extremely harsh to you, and will to Ada when you
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) what has passed between us. But if you had gone into the
case as I have, if you had only applied yourself to the papers as I
did when I was at Kenge's, if you only knew what an accumulation of
charges and counter-charges, and suspicions and cross-suspicions,
they involve, you would think me moderate in comparison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``But do you think that, among those many
papers, there is much truth and justice, Richard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is truth and justice somewhere in the case, Esther--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or was once, long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is--is--must be somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>pursued Richard impetuously, <div class="bookquote">``and must
be brought out. To allow Ada to be made a bribe and hush-money of is
not the way to bring it out. You say the suit is changing me; John
Jarndyce says it changes, has changed, and will change everybody who
has any share in it. Then the greater right I have on my side when I
resolve to do all I can to bring it to an end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All you can, Richard! Do you think that in these many years no
others have done all they could? Has the difficulty grown easier
because of so many failures?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't last for ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard with a fierceness kindling
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) which again presented to me that last sad reminder. <div class="bookquote">``I am
young and earnest, and energy and determination have done wonders
many a time. Others have only half thrown themselves into it. I
devote myself to it. I make it the object of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Richard, my dear, so much the worse, so much the worse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no, don't you be afraid for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) returned affectionately.
<div class="bookquote">``You're a dear, good, wise, quiet, blessed girl; but you have your
prepossessions. So I come round to John Jarndyce. I tell you, my good
Esther, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) and I were on those terms which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) found so
convenient, we were not on natural terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are division and animosity your natural terms, Richard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't say that. I mean that all this business puts us on
unnatural terms, with which natural relations are incompatible. See
another reason for urging it on! I may find out when it's over that I
have been mistaken in John Jarndyce. My head may be clearer when I am
free of it, and I may then agree with what you say to-day. Very well.
Then I shall acknowledge it and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) reparation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Everything postponed to that imaginary time! Everything held in
confusion and indecision until then!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my best of confidantes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``I want my cousin Ada to
understand that I am not captious, fickle, and wilful about John
Jarndyce, but that I have this purpose and reason at my back. I wish
to represent myself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) through you, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) has a great
esteem and respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cousin John; and I know you will soften
the course I take, even though you disapprove of it; and--and in
short,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, who had been hesitating through these words,
<div class="bookquote">``I--I don't like to represent myself in this litigious, contentious,
doubting character to a confiding girl like Ada.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was more like himself in those latter words than
in anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had said yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>acknowledged Richard, <div class="bookquote">``that may be true enough, my love. I
rather feel it to be so. But I shall be able to give myself fair-play
by and by. I shall come all right again, then, don't you be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) if this were all he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wished me to tell Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. ``I am bound not to withhold from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) that
John Jarndyce answered my letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) usual manner, addressing me
as ``My dear Rick,<div class="bookquote">'' trying to argue me out of my opinions, and telling
me that they should make no difference in him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). -LRB-All very well of
course, but not altering the case.-RRB- I also want Ada to know that if I
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) seldom just now, I am looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) interests as well as
my own--we two being in the same boat exactly--and that I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
will not suppose from any flying rumours she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) may hear that I am at
all light-headed or imprudent; on the contrary, I am always looking
forward to the termination of the suit, and always planning in that
direction. Being of age now and having taken the step I have taken, I
consider myself free from any accountability to John Jarndyce; but
Ada being still a ward of the court, I don't yet ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) to renew our
engagement. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is free to act for herself, I shall be myself
once more and we shall both be in very different worldly
circumstances, I believe. If you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) all this with the advantage
of your considerate way, you will do me a very great and a very kind
service, my dear Esther; and I shall knock Jarndyce and Jarndyce on
the head with greater vigour. Of course I ask for no secrecy at Bleak
House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you place great confidence in me, but I fear you
will not take advice from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's impossible that I can on this subject, my dear girl. On any
other, readily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As if there were any other in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) life! As if his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) whole career and
character were not being dyed one colour!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I may ask you a question, Richard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know who may not, if you
may not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say, yourself, you are not leading a very settled life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I, my dear Esther, with nothing settled!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in debt again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, astonished at my simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, certainly. I can't throw myself into an object so
completely without expense. You forget, or perhaps you don't know,
that under either of the wills Ada and I take something. It's only a
question between the larger sum and the smaller. I shall be within
the mark any way. Bless your heart, my excellent girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard,
quite amused with me, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be all right! I shall pull through, my
dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt so deeply sensible of the danger in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) stood that I
tried, in Ada's name, in my guardian's, in my own, by every fervent
means that I could think of, to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) of it and to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) some
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mistakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) received everything I said with patience and
gentleness, but it all rebounded from him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) without taking the least
effect. I could not wonder at this after the reception his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
preoccupied mind had given to my guardian's letter, but I determined
to try Ada's influence yet.

<p/>So when our walk brought us round to the village again, and I went
home to breakfast, I prepared Ada for the account I was going to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) exactly what reason we had to dread that Richard was
losing himself and scattering his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) whole life to the winds. It made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) very unhappy, of course, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had a far, far greater
reliance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) correcting his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) errors than I could have--which was so
natural and loving in my dear!--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) presently wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) this
little letter:


<p/>My dearest cousin,

<p/>Esther has told me all you said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) this morning. I
write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) said to you and to let you know how sure I am that
you will sooner or later find our cousin John a pattern
of truth, sincerity, and goodness, when you will deeply,
deeply grieve to have done him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) -LRB-without intending it-RRB- so
much wrong.

<p/>I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next,
but I trust you will understand it as I mean it. I have
some fears, my dearest cousin, that it may be partly for
my sake you are now laying up so much unhappiness for
yourself--and if for yourself, for me. In case this should
be so, or in case you should entertain much thought of me
in what you are doing, I most earnestly entreat and beg
you to desist. You can do nothing for my sake that will
make me half so happy as for ever turning your back upon
the shadow in which we both were born. Do not be angry
with me for saying this. Pray, pray, dear Richard, for my
sake, and for your own, and in a natural repugnance for
that source of trouble which had its share in making us
both orphans when we were very young, pray, pray, let it
go for ever. We have reason to know by this time that
there is no good in it and no hope, that there is nothing
to be got from it but sorrow.

<p/>My dearest cousin, it is needless for me to say that you
are quite free and that it is very likely you may find
some one whom you will love much better than your first
fancy. I am quite sure, if you will let me say so, that
the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow
your fortunes far and wide, however moderate or poor, and
see you happy, doing your duty and pursuing your chosen
way, than to have the hope of being, or even to be, very
rich with you -LRB-if such a thing were possible-RRB- at the cost
of dragging years of procrastination and anxiety and of
your indifference to other aims. You may wonder at my
saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or
experience, but I know it for a certainty from my own
heart.

<p/>Ever, my dearest cousin, your most affectionate

<p/>Ada


<p/>This note brought Richard to us very soon, but it made little change
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) if any. We would fairly try, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said, who was right and who
was wrong--he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would show us--we should see! He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was animated and
glowing, as if Ada's tenderness had gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>); but I could only
hope, with a sigh, that the letter might have some stronger effect
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind on re-perusal than it assuredly had then.

<p/>As they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to
return by the coach next morning, I sought an opportunity of speaking
to Mr. Skimpole. Our out-of-door life easily threw one in my way, and
I delicately said that there was a responsibility in encouraging
Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Responsibility, my dear Miss Summerson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) repeated, catching at
the word with the pleasantest smile. <div class="bookquote">``I am the last man in the world
for such a thing. I never was responsible in my life--I can't be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid everybody is obliged to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I timidly enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
being so much older and more clever than I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, really?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, receiving this new light with a most
agreeable jocularity of surprise. <div class="bookquote">``But every man's not obliged to be
solvent? I am not. I never was. See, my dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) took
a handful of loose silver and halfpence from his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) pocket, <div class="bookquote">``there's so
much money. I have not an idea how much. I have not the power of
counting. Call it four and ninepence--call it four pound nine. They
tell me I owe more than that. I dare say I do. I dare say I owe as
much as good-natured people will let me owe. If they don't stop, why
should I? There you have Harold Skimpole in little. If that's
responsibility, I am responsible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a handful halfpence</b></font>)</div><p/>The perfect ease of manner with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) put the money up again and
looked at me with a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) refined face, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been
mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else, almost made me
feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) really had nothing to do with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, when you mention responsibility,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) resumed, ``I am disposed to
say that I never had the happiness of knowing any one whom I should
consider so refreshingly responsible as yourself. You appear to me
to be the very touchstone of responsibility. When I see you, my
dear Miss Summerson, intent upon the perfect working of the whole
little orderly system of which you are the centre, I feel inclined
to say to myself--in fact I do say to myself very often--THAT<div class="bookquote">``S
responsibility!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was difficult, after this, to explain what I meant; but I
persisted so far as to say that we all hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would check and not
confirm Richard in the sanguine views he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) entertained just then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) retorted, ``if I could. But, my dear Miss
Summerson, I have no art, no disguise. If he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) takes me by the hand and
leads me through Westminster Hall in an airy procession after
fortune, I must go. If he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says, ``Skimpole, join the dance!<div class="bookquote">'' I must
join it. Common sense wouldn't, I know, but I have NO common sense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very unfortunate for Richard, I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole. ``Don't say that, don't say
that. Let us suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) keeping company with Common Sense--an
excellent man--a good deal wrinkled--dreadfully practical--change for
a ten-pound note in every pocket--ruled account-book in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
hand--say, upon the whole, resembling a tax-gatherer. Our dear
Richard, sanguine, ardent, overleaping obstacles, bursting with
poetry like a young bud, says to this highly respectable companion,
``I see a golden prospect before me; it's very bright, it's very
beautiful, it's very joyous; here I go, bounding over the landscape
to come at it!<div class="bookquote">'' The respectable companion instantly knocks him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) down
with the ruled account-book; tells him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) in a literal, prosaic way that
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sees no such thing; shows him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) it's nothing but fees, fraud,
horsehair wigs, and black gowns. Now you know that's a painful
change--sensible in the last degree, I have no doubt, but
disagreeable. I can't do it. I haven't got the ruled account-book, I
have none of the tax-gathering elements in my composition, I am not
at all respectable, and I don't want to be. Odd perhaps, but so it
is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was idle to say more, so I proposed that we should join Ada and
Richard, who were a little in advance, and I gave up Mr. Skimpole in
despair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had been over the Hall in the course of the morning and
whimsically described the family pictures as we walked. There were
such portentous shepherdesses among the Ladies Dedlock dead and gone,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) told us, that peaceful crooks became weapons of assault in their
hands. They tended their flocks severely in buckram and powder and
put their sticking-plaster patches on to terrify commoners as the
chiefs of some other tribes put on their war-paint. There was a Sir
Somebody Dedlock, with a battle, a sprung-mine, volumes of smoke,
flashes of lightning, a town on fire, and a stormed fort, all in full
action between his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) horse's two hind legs, showing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) supposed, how
little a Dedlock made of such trifles. The whole race he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) represented
as having evidently been, in life, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``stuffed people'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a
large collection, glassy eyed, set up in the most approved manner on
their various twigs and perches, very correct, perfectly free from
animation, and always in glass cases.

<p/>I was not so easy now during any reference to the name but that I
felt it a relief when Richard, with an exclamation of surprise,
hurried away to meet a stranger whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) first descried coming slowly
towards us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``Vholes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>that a friend</b></font>)</div><p/>We asked if that were a friend of Richard's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Friend and legal adviser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear Miss
Summerson, if you want common sense, responsibility, and
respectability, all united--if you want an exemplary man--Vholes is
THE man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>We had not known, we said, that Richard was assisted by any gentleman
of that name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emerged from legal infancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
parted from our conversational friend Kenge and took up, I believe,
with Vholes. Indeed, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) did, because I introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) to
Vholes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you known him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>asked Ada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vholes? My dear Miss Clare, I had had that kind of acquaintance with
him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) which I have had with several gentlemen of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) profession. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had
done something or other in a very agreeable, civil manner--taken
proceedings, I think, is the expression--which ended in the
proceeding of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) taking ME. Somebody was so good as to step in and
pay the money--something and fourpence was the amount; I forget the
pounds and shillings, but I know it ended with fourpence, because it
struck me at the time as being so odd that I could owe anybody
fourpence--and after that I brought them together. Vholes asked me
for the introduction, and I gave it. Now I come to think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
looked inquiringly at us with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) frankest smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) made the
discovery, <div class="bookquote">``Vholes bribed me, perhaps? He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) gave me something and
called it commission. Was it a five-pound note? Do you know, I think
it MUST have been a five-pound note!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) further consideration of the point was prevented by Richard's
coming back to us in an excited state and hastily representing Mr.
Vholes--a sallow man with pinched lips that looked as if they were
cold, a red eruption here and there upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) face, tall and thin,
about fifty years of age, high-shouldered, and stooping. Dressed in
black, black-gloved, and buttoned to the chin, there was nothing so
remarkable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) as a lifeless manner and a slow, fixed way he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) had
of looking at Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I don't disturb you, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, and now I
observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was further remarkable for an inward manner of
speaking. <div class="bookquote">``I arranged with Mr. Carstone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) should always know
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) cause was in the Chancellor's paper, and being informed by
one of my clerks last night after post time that it stood, rather
unexpectedly, in the paper for to-morrow, I put myself into the coach
early this morning and came down to confer with him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, flushed, and looking triumphantly at Ada and me,
<div class="bookquote">``we don't do these things in the old slow way now. We spin along now!
Mr. Vholes, we must hire something to get over to the post town in,
and catch the mail to-night, and go up by it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything you please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Vholes. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite at your
service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``If I run down to
the Dedlock, and get my portmanteau fastened up, and order a gig, or
a chaise, or whatever's to be got, we shall have an hour then before
starting. I'll come back to tea. Cousin Ada, will you and Esther take
care of Mr. Vholes when I am gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was away directly, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) heat and hurry, and was soon lost in the
dusk of evening. We who were left walked on towards the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Carstone's presence necessary to-morrow, Sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Can
it do any good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>Mr. Vholes replied. <div class="bookquote">``I am not aware that it can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Both Ada</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Ada and I expressed our regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) should go, then, only to
be disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carstone has laid down the principle of watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) own
interests,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, <div class="bookquote">``and when a client lays down his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) own
principle, and it is not immoral, it devolves upon me to carry it
out. I wish in business to be exact and open. I am a widower with
three daughters--Emma, Jane, and Caroline--and my desire is so to
discharge the duties of life as to leave them a good name. This
appears to be a pleasant spot, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark being made to me in consequence of my being next him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) as we
walked, I assented and enumerated its chief attractions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes. <div class="bookquote">``I have the privilege of supporting an
aged father in the Vale of Taunton--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) native place--and I admire
that country very much. I had no idea there was anything so
attractive here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>To keep up the conversation, I asked Mr. Vholes if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) would like to
live altogether in the country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you touch me on a tender string. My health
is not good -LRB-my digestion being much impaired-RRB-, and if I had only
myself to consider, I should take refuge in rural habits, especially
as the cares of business have prevented me from ever coming much into
contact with general society, and particularly with ladies' society,
which I have most wished to mix in. But with my three daughters,
Emma, Jane, and Caroline--and my aged father--I cannot afford to be
selfish. It is true I have no longer to maintain a dear grandmother
who died in her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) hundred and second year, but enough remains to render
it indispensable that the mill should be always going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It required some attention to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) inward
speaking and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) lifeless manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will excuse my having mentioned my daughters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They
are my weak point. I wish to leave the poor girls some little
independence, as well as a good name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boythorn/Boythorn/Lawrence Boythorn</b></font>)</div><p/>We now arrived at Mr. Boythorn's house, where the tea-table, all
prepared, was awaiting us. Richard came in restless and hurried
shortly afterwards, and leaning over Mr. Vholes's chair, whispered
something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) ear. Mr. Vholes replied aloud--or as nearly aloud I
suppose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) had ever replied to anything--<div class="bookquote">``You will drive me, will
you, sir? It is all the same to me, sir. Anything you please. I am
quite at your service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We understood from what followed that Mr. Skimpole was to be left
until the morning to occupy the two places which had been already
paid for. As Ada and I were both in low spirits concerning Richard
and very sorry so to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), we made it as plain as we
politely could that we should leave Mr. Skimpole to the Dedlock Arms
and retire when the night-travellers were gone.

<p/>Richard's high spirits carrying everything before them, we all went
out together to the top of the hill above the village, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had
ordered a gig to wait and where we found a man with a lantern
standing at the head of the gaunt pale horse that had been harnessed
to it.

<p/>I never shall forget those two seated side by side in the lantern's
light, Richard all flush and fire and laughter, with the reins in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
hand; Mr. Vholes quite still, black-gloved, and buttoned up, looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) were looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) prey and charming it. I have
before me the whole picture of the warm dark night, the summer
lightning, the dusty track of road closed in by hedgerows and high
trees, the gaunt pale horse with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) ears pricked up, and the driving
away at speed to Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

<p/>My dear girl told me that night how Richard's being thereafter
prosperous or ruined, befriended or deserted, could only make this
difference to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) needed love from one unchanging
heart, the more love that unchanging heart would have to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>);
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) present errors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would think
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) at all times--never of herself if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could devote herself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), never of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own delights if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could minister to his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>).

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) word?

<p/>I look along the road before me, where the distance already shortens
and the journey's end is growing visible; and true and good above the
dead sea of the Chancery suit and all the ashy fruit it cast ashore,
I think I see my darling.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII

<p/>A Struggle


<p/>When our time came for returning to Bleak House again, we were
punctual to the day and were received with an overpowering welcome. I
was perfectly restored to health and strength, and finding my
housekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room, rang myself in as if
I had been a new year, with a merry little peal. <div class="bookquote">``Once more, duty,
duty, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``and if you are not overjoyed to do it, more
than cheerfully and contentedly, through anything and everything, you
ought to be. That's all I have to say to you, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The first few mornings were mornings of so much bustle and business,
devoted to such settlements of accounts, such repeated journeys to
and fro between the growlery and all other parts of the house, so
many rearrangements of drawers and presses, and such a general new
beginning altogether, that I had not a moment's leisure. But when
these arrangements were completed and everything was in order, I paid
a visit of a few hours to London, which something in the letter I had
destroyed at Chesney Wold had induced me to decide upon in my own
mind.

<p/>I made Caddy Jellyby--her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) maiden name was so natural to me that I
always called her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) by it--the pretext for this visit and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) a
note previously asking the favour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) company on a little business
expedition. Leaving home very early in the morning, I got to London
by stage-coach in such good time that I got to Newman Street with the
day before me.

<p/>Caddy, who had not seen me since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) wedding-day, was so glad and so
affectionate that I was half inclined to fear I should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
husband jealous. But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way, just as bad--I mean as good;
and in short it was the old story, and nobody would leave me any
possibility of doing anything meritorious.

<p/>The elder Mr. Turveydrop was in bed, I found, and Caddy was
milling his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) chocolate, which a melancholy little boy who was an
apprentice--it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the
trade of dancing--was waiting to carry upstairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) father-in-law
was extremely kind and considerate, Caddy told me, and they lived
most happily together. -LRB-When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) spoke of their living together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good
lodging, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) husband had what they could get, and were
poked into two corner rooms over the Mews.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is your mama, Caddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>replied Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``through Pa, but I see
very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). We are good friends, I am glad to say, but Ma
thinks there is something absurd in my having married a
dancing-master, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is rather afraid of its extending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>It struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) own natural
duties and obligations before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) swept the horizon with a telescope
in search of others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) would have taken the best precautions
against becoming absurd, but I need scarcely observe that I kept this
to myself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your papa, Caddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) comes here every evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``and is so fond of
sitting in the corner there that it's a treat to see him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking at the corner, I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby's
head against the wall. It was consolatory to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had found
such a resting-place for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you are always busy, I'll be bound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``I am indeed, for to tell you a
grand secret, I am qualifying myself to give lessons. Prince's health
is not strong, and I want to be able to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). What with
schools, and classes here, and private pupils, AND the apprentices,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) really has too much to do, poor fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the apprentices</b></font>)</div><p/>The notion of the apprentices was still so odd to me that I asked
Caddy if there were many of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``One in-door, and three out. They are
very good children; only when they get together they WILL
play--children-like--instead of attending to their work. So the
little boy you saw just now waltzes by himself in the empty kitchen,
and we distribute the others over the house as well as we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is only for their steps, of course?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for their steps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Caddy. <div class="bookquote">``In that way they practise, so
many hours at a time, whatever steps they happen to be upon. They
dance in the academy, and at this time of year we do figures at five
every morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what a laborious life!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Caddy, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``when the out-door
apprentices ring us up in the morning -LRB-the bell rings into our room,
not to disturb old Mr. Turveydrop-RRB-, and when I put up the window and
see them standing on the door-step with their little pumps under
their arms, I am actually reminded of the Sweeps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>All this presented the art to me in a singular light, to be sure.
Caddy enjoyed the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) communication and cheerfully
recounted the particulars of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) own studies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, my dear, to save expense I ought to know something of the
piano, and I ought to know something of the kit too, and consequently
I have to practise those two instruments as well as the details of
our profession. If Ma had been like anybody else, I might have had
some little musical knowledge to begin upon. However, I hadn't any;
and that part of the work is, at first, a little discouraging, I must
allow. But I have a very good ear, and I am used to drudgery--I have
to thank Ma for that, at all events--and where there's a will there's
a way, you know, Esther, the world over.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Saying these words, Caddy
laughingly sat down at a little jingling square piano and really
rattled off a quadrille with great spirit. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) good-humouredly
and blushingly got up again, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) still laughed herself,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't laugh at me, please; that's a dear girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I would sooner have cried, but I did neither. I encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) and
praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) with all my heart. For I conscientiously believed,
dancing-master's wife though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, and dancing-mistress though in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) limited ambition she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aspired to be, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had struck out a natural,
wholesome, loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite
as good as a mission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, delighted, <div class="bookquote">``you can't think how you cheer me.
I shall owe you, you don't know how much. What changes, Esther, even
in my small world! You recollect that first night, when I was so
unpolite and inky? Who would have thought, then, of my ever teaching
people to dance, of all other possibilities and impossibilities!''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband Caddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, who had left us while we had this chat, now coming back,
preparatory to exercising the apprentices in the ball-room, Caddy
informed me she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was quite at my disposal. But it was not my time yet,
I was glad to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), for I should have been vexed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) away
then. Therefore we three adjourned to the apprentices together, and I
made one in the dance.

<p/>The apprentices were the queerest little people. Besides the
melancholy boy, who, I hoped, had not been made so by waltzing alone
in the empty kitchen, there were two other boys and one dirty little
limp girl in a gauzy dress. Such a precocious little girl, with such
a dowdy bonnet on -LRB-that, too, of a gauzy texture-RRB-, who brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule. Such mean
little boys, when they were not dancing, with string, and marbles,
and cramp-bones in their pockets, and the most untidy legs and
feet--and heels particularly.

<p/>I asked Caddy what had made their parents choose this profession for
them. Caddy said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't know; perhaps they were designed for
teachers, perhaps for the stage. They were all people in humble
circumstances, and the melancholy boy's mother kept a ginger-beer
shop.

<p/>We danced for an hour with great gravity, the melancholy child doing
wonders with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lower extremities, in which there appeared to be
some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) waist. Caddy,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was observant of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband and was evidently founded upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), had acquired a grace and self-possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own, which,
united to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pretty face and figure, was uncommonly agreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
already relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of much of the instruction of these young
people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seldom interfered except to walk his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) part in the
figure if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had anything to do in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) always played the tune. The
affectation of the gauzy child, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) condescension to the boys,
was a sight. And thus we danced an hour by the clock.

<p/>When the practice was concluded, Caddy's husband made himself ready
to go out of town to a school, and Caddy ran away to get ready to go
out with me. I sat in the ball-room in the interval, contemplating
the apprentices. The two out-door boys went upon the staircase to put
on their half-boots and pull the in-door boy's hair, as I judged from
the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) objections. Returning with their jackets buttoned
and their pumps stuck in them, they then produced packets of cold
bread and meat and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall. The
little gauzy child, having whisked her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sandals into the reticule and
put on a trodden-down pair of shoes, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head into the dowdy
bonnet at one shake, and answering my inquiry whether she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liked
dancing by replying, <div class="bookquote">``Not with boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>tied it across her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chin, and
went home contemptuous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Mr. Turveydrop is so sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caddy/Caddy Jellyby</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) has not
finished dressing yet and cannot have the pleasure of seeing you
before you go. You are such a favourite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>), Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caddy/Caddy Jellyby</b></font>)</div><p/>I expressed myself much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>), but did not think it
necessary to add that I readily dispensed with this attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) a long time to dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) is very
much looked up to in such things, you know, and has a reputation to
support. You can't think how kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) is to Pa.. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) talks to Pa of an
evening about the Prince Regent, and I never saw Pa so interested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in the picture of Mr. Turveydrop bestowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
deportment on Mr. Jellyby that quite took my fancy. I asked Caddy if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) papa out much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) does that, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) talks to
Pa, and Pa greatly admires him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>), and listens, and likes it. Of course
I am aware that Pa has hardly any claims to deportment, but they get
on together delightfully. You can't think what good companions they
make. I never saw Pa take snuff before in my life, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) takes one
pinch out of Mr. Turveydrop's box regularly and keeps putting it to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) nose and taking it away again all the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turveydrop/Turveydrop/MR. TURVEYDROP</b></font>)</div><p/>That old Mr. Turveydrop should ever, in the chances and changes of
life, have come to the rescue of Mr. Jellyby from Borrioboola-Gha
appeared to me to be one of the pleasantest of oddities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to Peepy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy with a little hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``whom I was most
afraid of--next to having any family of my own, Esther--as an
inconvenience to Mr. Turveydrop, the kindness of the old gentleman to
that child is beyond everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) asks to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>), my dear! He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) lets
him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) take the newspaper up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) in bed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) the crusts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) toast to eat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) on little errands about the house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) to come to me for sixpences. In short,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Caddy
cheerily, <div class="bookquote">``and not to prose, I am a very fortunate girl and ought to
be very grateful. Where are we going, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Old Street Road,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``where I have a few words to say to
the solicitor's clerk who was sent to meet me at the coach-office on
the very day when I came to London and first saw you, my dear. Now I
think of it, the gentleman who brought us to your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, indeed, I seem to be naturally the person to go with you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Caddy.

<p/>To the Old Street Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. Guppy's
residence for Mrs. Guppy. Mrs. Guppy, occupying the parlours and
having indeed been visibly in danger of cracking herself like a nut
in the front-parlour door by peeping out before she (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) was asked for,
immediately presented herself and requested us to walk in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) was an
old lady in a large cap, with rather a red nose and rather an
unsteady eye, but smiling all over. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) close little sitting-room was
prepared for a visit, and there was a portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) son in it
which, I had almost written here, was more like than life: it
insisted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with such obstinacy, and was so determined not to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) off.

<p/>Not only was the portrait there, but we found the original there too.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was dressed in a great many colours and was discovered at a table
reading law-papers with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) forefinger to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, rising, <div class="bookquote">``this is indeed an oasis.
Mother, will you be so good as to put a chair for the other lady and
get out of the gangway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Guppy, whose incessant smiling gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) quite a waggish
appearance, did as her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) son requested and then sat down in a corner,
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) pocket handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) chest, like a fomentation,
with both hands.

<p/>I presented Caddy, and Mr. Guppy said that any friend of mine was
more than welcome. I then proceeded to the object of my visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I took the liberty of sending you a note, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>Mr. Guppy acknowledged the receipt by taking it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
breast-pocket, putting it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) lips, and returning it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) pocket
with a bow. Mr. Guppy's mother was so diverted that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
head as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) elbow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I speak to you alone for a moment?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>Anything like the jocoseness of Mr. Guppy's mother just now, I think
I never saw. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made no sound of laughter, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head,
and shook it, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth, and appealed to
Caddy with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) elbow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulder, and was so
unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could marshal Caddy through the little folding-door into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
bedroom adjoining.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``you will excuse the waywardness of
a parent ever mindful of a son's appiness. My mother, though highly
exasperating to the feelings, is actuated by maternal dictates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>I could hardly have believed that anybody could in a moment have
turned so red or changed so much as Mr. Guppy did when I now put up
my veil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I,
<div class="bookquote">``in preference to calling at Mr. Kenge's because, remembering what
you said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence, I feared
I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment, Mr. Guppy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) embarrassment enough as it was, I am sure. I never saw
such faltering, such confusion, such amazement and apprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>stammered Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``I--I--beg your pardon, but in
our profession--we--we--find it necessary to be explicit. You have
referred to an occasion, miss, when I--when I did myself the honour
of making a declaration which--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Something seemed to rise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) throat that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) could not possibly
swallow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hand there, coughed, made faces, tried again to
swallow it, coughed again, made faces again, looked all round the
room, and fluttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) papers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A kind of giddy sensation has come upon me, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) explained,
<div class="bookquote">``which rather knocks me over. I--er--a little subject to this sort of
thing--er--by George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) a little time to recover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) consumed it in putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) forehead and taking it away again, and in backing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
chair into the corner behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My intention was to remark, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``dear
me--something bronchial, I think--hem!--to remark that you was so
good on that occasion as to repel and repudiate that declaration.
You--you wouldn't perhaps object to admit that? Though no witnesses
are present, it might be a satisfaction to--to your mind--if you was
to put in that admission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that I declined your proposal
without any reservation or qualification whatever, Mr. Guppy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) returned, measuring the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) troubled
hands. <div class="bookquote">``So far that's satisfactory, and it does you credit. Er--this
is certainly bronchial!--must be in the tubes--er--you wouldn't
perhaps be offended if I was to mention--not that it's necessary, for
your own good sense or any person's sense must show 'em that--if I
was to mention that such declaration on my part was final, and there
terminated?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite understand that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps--er--it may not be worth the form, but it might be a
satisfaction to your mind--perhaps you wouldn't object to admit that,
miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I admit it most fully and freely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Very honourable, I am sure. I
regret that my arrangements in life, combined with circumstances over
which I have no control, will put it out of my power ever to fall
back upon that offer or to renew it in any shape or form whatever,
but it will ever be a retrospect entwined--er--with friendship's
bowers.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy's bronchitis came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) relief and stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
measurement of the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be honoured, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``I am so persuaded
that your own good sense and right feeling, miss, will--will keep you
as square as possible--that I can have nothing but pleasure, I am
sure, in hearing any observations you may wish to offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were so good as to imply, on that occasion--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``but we had better not travel out
of the record into implication. I cannot admit that I implied
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said on that occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I recommenced, <div class="bookquote">``that you might possibly
have the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by
making discoveries of which I should be the subject. I presume that
you founded that belief upon your general knowledge of my being an
orphan girl, indebted for everything to the benevolence of Mr.
Jarndyce. Now, the beginning and the end of what I have come to beg
of you is, Mr. Guppy, that you will have the kindness to relinquish
all idea of so serving me. I have thought of this sometimes, and I
have thought of it most lately--since I have been ill. At length I
have decided, in case you should at any time recall that purpose and
act upon it in any way, to come to you and assure you that you are
altogether mistaken. You could make no discovery in reference to me
that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure. I
am acquainted with my personal history, and I have it in my power to
assure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means. You
may, perhaps, have abandoned this project a long time. If so, excuse
my giving you unnecessary trouble. If not, I entreat you, on the
assurance I have given you, henceforth to lay it aside. I beg you to
do this, for my peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am bound to confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``that you express yourself,
miss, with that good sense and right feeling for which I gave you
credit. Nothing can be more satisfactory than such right feeling, and
if I mistook any intentions on your part just now, I am prepared to
tender a full apology. I should wish to be understood, miss, as
hereby offering that apology--limiting it, as your own good sense and
right feeling will point out the necessity of, to the present
proceedings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>I must say for Mr. Guppy that the snuffling manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) had had upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) improved very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) seemed truly glad to be able to do
something I asked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) looked ashamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once so that I
may have no occasion to resume,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) about to
speak, <div class="bookquote">``you will do me a kindness, sir. I come to you as privately as
possible because you announced this impression of yours to me in a
confidence which I have really wished to respect--and which I always
have respected, as you remember. I have mentioned my illness. There
really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very
well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to
you is quite removed. Therefore I make the entreaty I have now
preferred, and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me
to accede to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I must do Mr. Guppy the further justice of saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) had looked
more and more ashamed and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) looked most ashamed and very
earnest when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) now replied with a burning face, <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word and
honour, upon my life, upon my soul, Miss Summerson, as I am a living
man, I'll act according to your wish! I'll never go another step in
opposition to it. I'll take my oath to it if it will be any
satisfaction to you. In what I promise at this present time touching
the matters now in question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Guppy rapidly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
were repeating a familiar form of words, <div class="bookquote">``I speak the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said I, rising at this point, <div class="bookquote">``and I thank
you very much. Caddy, my dear, I am ready!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy's mother returned with Caddy -LRB-now making me the recipient
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silent laughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nudges-RRB-, and we took our leave. Mr.
Guppy saw us to the door with the air of one who was either
imperfectly awake or walking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) sleep; and we left him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) there,
staring.

<p/>But in a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) came after us down the street without any hat, and
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) long hair all blown about, and stopped us, saying fervently,
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson, upon my honour and soul, you may depend upon me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``quite confidently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, going with one leg and
staying with the other, <div class="bookquote">``but this lady being present--your own
witness--it might be a satisfaction to your mind -LRB-which I should wish
to set at rest-RRB- if you was to repeat those admissions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Caddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you will not be
surprised when I tell you, my dear, that there never has been any
engagement--''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Guppy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``between
this gentleman--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``William Guppy, of Penton Place, Pentonville, in the county of
Middlesex,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Between this gentleman, Mr. William Guppy, of Penton Place,
Pentonville, in the county of Middlesex, and myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Very full--er--excuse me--lady's
name, Christian and surname both?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I gave them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Married woman, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Married woman. Thank
you. Formerly Caroline Jellyby, spinster, then of Thavies Inn, within
the city of London, but extra-parochial; now of Newman Street, Oxford
Street. Much obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) ran home and came running back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Touching that matter, you know, I really and truly am very sorry
that my arrangements in life, combined with circumstances over which
I have no control, should prevent a renewal of what was wholly
terminated some time back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy to me forlornly and
despondently, <div class="bookquote">``but it couldn't be. Now COULD it, you know! I only put
it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I replied it certainly could not. The subject did not admit of a
doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) thanked me and ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mother's again--and back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very honourable of you, miss, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``If
an altar could be erected in the bowers of friendship--but, upon my
soul, you may rely upon me in every respect save and except the
tender passion only!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>The struggle in Mr. Guppy's breast and the numerous oscillations it
occasioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) between his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mother's door and us were sufficiently
conspicuous in the windy street -LRB-particularly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hair wanted
cutting-RRB- to make us hurry away. I did so with a lightened heart; but
when we last looked back, Mr. Guppy was still oscillating in the same
troubled state of mind.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX

<p/>Attorney and Client


<p/>The name of Mr. Vholes, preceded by the legend Ground-Floor, is
inscribed upon a door-post in Symond's Inn, Chancery Lane--a little,
pale, wall-eyed, woebegone inn like a large dust-binn of two
compartments and a sifter. It looks as if Symond were a sparing man
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Symond</b></font>) way and constructed his (<font color='blue'><b>Symond</b></font>) inn of old building materials which
took kindly to the dry rot and to dirt and all things decaying and
dismal, and perpetuated Symond's memory with congenial shabbiness.
Quartered in this dingy hatchment commemorative of Symond are the
legal bearings of Mr. Vholes.

<p/>Mr. Vholes's office, in disposition retiring and in situation
retired, is squeezed up in a corner and blinks at a dead wall. Three
feet of knotty-floored dark passage bring the client to Mr. Vholes's
jet-black door, in an angle profoundly dark on the brightest
midsummer morning and encumbered by a black bulk-head of cellarage
staircase against which belated civilians generally strike their
brows. Mr. Vholes's chambers are on so small a scale that one clerk
can open the door without getting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) stool, while the other who
elbows him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) at the same desk has equal facilities for poking the fire.
A smell as of unwholesome sheep blending with the smell of must and
dust is referable to the nightly -LRB-and often daily-RRB- consumption of
mutton fat in candles and to the fretting of parchment forms and
skins in greasy drawers. The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close.
The place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man,
and the two chimneys smoke, and there is a loose outer surface of
soot everywhere, and the dull cracked windows in their heavy frames
have but one piece of character in them, which is a determination to
be always dirty and always shut unless coerced. This accounts for the
phenomenon of the weaker of the two usually having a bundle of
firewood thrust between its jaws in hot weather.

<p/>Mr. Vholes is a very respectable man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) has not a large business,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) is a very respectable man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) is allowed by the greater
attorneys who have made good fortunes or are making them to be a most
respectable man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never misses a chance in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) practice, which is a
mark of respectability. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never takes any pleasure, which is another
mark of respectability. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is reserved and serious, which is another
mark of respectability. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) digestion is impaired, which is highly
respectable. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is making hay of the grass which is flesh, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) three daughters. And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father is dependent on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the Vale
of Taunton.

<p/>The one great principle of the English law is to make business for
itself. There is no other principle distinctly, certainly, and
consistently maintained through all its narrow turnings. Viewed by
this light it becomes a coherent scheme and not the monstrous maze
the laity are apt to think it. Let them but once clearly perceive
that its grand principle is to make business for itself at their
expense, and surely they will cease to grumble.

<p/>But not perceiving this quite plainly--only seeing it by halves in a
confused way--the laity sometimes suffer in peace and pocket, with a
bad grace, and DO grumble very much. Then this respectability of Mr.
Vholes is brought into powerful play against them. <div class="bookquote">``Repeal this
statute, my good sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Kenge to a smarting client. <div class="bookquote">``Repeal
it, my dear sir? Never, with my consent. Alter this law, sir, and
what will be the effect of your rash proceeding on a class of
practitioners very worthily represented, allow me to say to you, by
the opposite attorney in the case, Mr. Vholes? Sir, that class of
practitioners would be swept from the face of the earth. Now you
cannot afford--I will say, the social system cannot afford--to lose
an order of men like Mr. Vholes. Diligent, persevering, steady, acute
in business. My dear sir, I understand your present feelings against
the existing state of things, which I grant to be a little hard in
your case; but I can never raise my voice for the demolition of a
class of men like Mr. Vholes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>The respectability of Mr. Vholes has
even been cited with crushing effect before Parliamentary committees,
as in the following blue minutes of a distinguished attorney's
evidence. <div class="bookquote">``Question -LRB-number five hundred and seventeen thousand eight
hundred and sixty-nine-RRB-: If I understand you, these forms of practice
indisputably occasion delay? Answer: Yes, some delay. Question: And
great expense? Answer: Most assuredly they cannot be gone through for
nothing. Question: And unspeakable vexation? Answer: I am not
prepared to say that. They have never given ME any vexation; quite
the contrary. Question: But you think that their abolition would
damage a class of practitioners? Answer: I have no doubt of it.
Question: Can you instance any type of that class? Answer: Yes. I
would unhesitatingly mention Mr. Vholes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) would be ruined.
Question: Mr. Vholes is considered, in the profession, a respectable
man? Answer:'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--which proved fatal to the inquiry for ten years--<div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Vholes is considered, in the profession, a MOST respectable man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>authorities</b></font>)</div><p/>So in familiar conversation, private authorities no less
disinterested will remark that they don't know what this age is
coming to, that we are plunging down precipices, that now here is
something else gone, that these changes are death to people like
Vholes--a man of undoubted respectability, with a father in the Vale
of Taunton, and three daughters at home. Take a few steps more in
this direction, say they, and what is to become of Vholes's father?
Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) to perish? And of Vholes's daughters? Are they to be
shirt-makers, or governesses? As though, Mr. Vholes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) relations
being minor cannibal chiefs and it being proposed to abolish
cannibalism, indignant champions were to put the case thus: Make
man-eating unlawful, and you starve the Vholeses!

<p/>In a word, Mr. Vholes, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) three daughters and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) father in the
Vale of Taunton, is continually doing duty, like a piece of timber,
to shore up some decayed foundation that has become a pitfall and a
nuisance. And with a great many people in a great many instances, the
question is never one of a change from wrong to right -LRB-which is quite
an extraneous consideration-RRB-, but is always one of injury or
advantage to that eminently respectable legion, Vholes.

<p/>The Chancellor is, within these ten minutes, <div class="bookquote">``up''  (<font color='red'><b>The Chancellor</b></font>)</div>for the long
vacation. Mr. Vholes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) young client, and several blue bags
hastily stuffed out of all regularity of form, as the larger sort of
serpents are in their first gorged state, have returned to the
official den. Mr. Vholes, quiet and unmoved, as a man of so much
respectability ought to be, takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) close black gloves as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
were skinning his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) hands, lifts off his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) tight hat as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) were
scalping himself, and sits down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) desk. The client throws his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
hat and gloves upon the ground--tosses them anywhere, without looking
after them or caring where they go; flings himself into a chair, half
sighing and half groaning; rests his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) aching head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) hand and
looks the portrait of young despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again nothing done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>says Richard. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing, nothing done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say nothing done, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns the placid Vholes. <div class="bookquote">``That is
scarcely fair, sir, scarcely fair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what IS done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>says Richard, turning gloomily upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That may not be the whole question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>returns Vholes, <div class="bookquote">``The question
may branch off into what is doing, what is doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>the moody client</b></font>)</div>asks the moody client.

<p/>Vholes, sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) arms on the desk, quietly bringing the tips
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) five right fingers to meet the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) five left fingers,
and quietly separating them again, and fixedly and slowly looking at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) client, replies, <div class="bookquote">``A good deal is doing, sir. We have put our
shoulders to the wheel, Mr. Carstone, and the wheel is going round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>client</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, with Ixion on it. How am I to get through the next four or five
accursed months?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaims the young man, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) chair and
walking about the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. C.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>returns Vholes, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) close with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) eyes wherever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) goes, <div class="bookquote">``your spirits are hasty, and I am sorry for it on your
account. Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much, not to be
so impetuous, not to wear yourself out so. You should have more
patience. You should sustain yourself better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to imitate you, in fact, Mr. Vholes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>says Richard, sitting
down again with an impatient laugh and beating the devil's tattoo
with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) boot on the patternless carpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the client</b></font>)</div>returns Vholes, always looking at the client as if he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) were
making a lingering meal of him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) eyes as well as with his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>)
professional appetite. <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>returns Vholes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) inward manner
of speech and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) bloodless quietude, <div class="bookquote">``I should not have had the
presumption to propose myself as a model for your imitation or any
man's. Let me but leave the good name to my three daughters, and that
is enough for me; I am not a self-seeker. But since you mention me so
pointedly, I will acknowledge that I should like to impart to you a
little of my--come, sir, you are disposed to call it insensibility,
and I am sure I have no objection--say insensibility--a little of my
insensibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vholes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the client</b></font>)</div>explains the client, somewhat abashed, <div class="bookquote">``I had no
intention to accuse you of insensibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the client</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you had, sir, without knowing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns the equable
Vholes. <div class="bookquote">``Very naturally. It is my duty to attend to your interests
with a cool head, and I can quite understand that to your excited
feelings I may appear, at such times as the present, insensible. My
daughters may know me better; my aged father may know me better. But
they have known me much longer than you have, and the confiding eye
of affection is not the distrustful eye of business. Not that I
complain, sir, of the eye of business being distrustful; quite the
contrary. In attending to your interests, I wish to have all possible
checks upon me; it is right that I should have them; I court inquiry.
But your interests demand that I should be cool and methodical, Mr.
Carstone; and I cannot be otherwise--no, sir, not even to please
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vholes, after glancing at the official cat who is patiently
watching a mouse's hole, fixes his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) charmed gaze again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) young
client and proceeds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) buttoned-up, half-audible voice as if
there were an unclean spirit in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) that will neither come out nor
speak out, <div class="bookquote">``What are you to do, sir, you inquire, during the
vacation. I should hope you gentlemen of the army may find many means
of amusing yourselves if you give your minds to it. If you had asked
me what I was to do during the vacation, I could have answered you
more readily. I am to attend to your interests. I am to be found
here, day by day, attending to your interests. That is my duty, Mr.
C., and term-time or vacation makes no difference to me. If you wish
to consult me as to your interests, you will find me here at all
times alike. Other professional men go out of town. I don't. Not that
I blame them for going; I merely say I don't go. This desk is your
rock, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vholes gives it a rap, and it sounds as hollow as a coffin. Not
to Richard, though. There is encouragement in the sound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).
Perhaps Mr. Vholes knows there is.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly aware, Mr. Vholes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>says Richard, more familiarly and
good-humouredly, <div class="bookquote">``that you are the most reliable fellow in the world
and that to have to do with you is to have to do with a man of
business who is not to be hoodwinked. But put yourself in my case,
dragging on this dislocated life, sinking deeper and deeper into
difficulty every day, continually hoping and continually
disappointed, conscious of change upon change for the worse in
myself, and of no change for the better in anything else, and you
will find it a dark-looking case sometimes, as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Vholes, <div class="bookquote">``that I never give hopes, sir. I told
you from the first, Mr. C., that I never give hopes. Particularly in
a case like this, where the greater part of the costs comes out of
the estate, I should not be considerate of my good name if I gave
hopes. It might seem as if costs were my object. Still, when you say
there is no change for the better, I must, as a bare matter of fact,
deny that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returns Richard, brightening. <div class="bookquote">``But how do you make it out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carstone, you are represented by--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said just now--a rock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Vholes, gently shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) head and rapping the
hollow desk, with a sound as if ashes were falling on ashes, and dust
on dust, ``a rock. That's something. You are separately represented,
and no longer hidden and lost in the interests of others. THAT``S
something. The suit does not sleep; we wake it up, we air it, we walk
it about. THAT``S something. It's not all Jarndyce, in fact as well as
in name. THAT``S something. Nobody has it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) own way now, sir.
And THAT<div class="bookquote">``S something, surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face flushing suddenly, strikes the desk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
clenched hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vholes! If any man had told me when I first went to John
Jarndyce's house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was anything but the disinterested friend he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
seemed--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) has gradually turned out to be--I could
have found no words strong enough to repel the slander; I could not
have defended him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) too ardently. So little did I know of the world!
Whereas now I do declare to you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) becomes to me the embodiment
of the suit; that in place of its being an abstraction, it is John
Jarndyce; that the more I suffer, the more indignant I am with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>);
that every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new
injury from John Jarndyce's hand.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I, Mr. C.?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well enough to know what his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) intentions were. Are or are not our
interests conflicting? Tell--me--that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>says Richard, accompanying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) last three words with three raps on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) rock of trust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. C.,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Vholes, immovable in attitude and never winking his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
hungry eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I should be wanting in my duty as your professional
adviser, I should be departing from my fidelity to your interests, if
I represented those interests as identical with the interests of Mr.
Jarndyce. They are no such thing, sir. I never impute motives; I both
have and am a father, and I never impute motives. But I must not
shrink from a professional duty, even if it sows dissensions in
families. I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as
to your interests? You are so? I reply, then, they are not identical
with those of Mr. Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they are not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cries Richard. <div class="bookquote">``You found that out long

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. C.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>returns Vholes, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to say no more of any third party
than is necessary. I wish to leave my good name unsullied, together
with any little property of which I may become possessed through
industry and perseverance, to my daughters Emma, Jane, and Caroline.
I also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren. When
Mr. Skimpole did me the honour, sir--I will not say the very high
honour, for I never stoop to flattery--of bringing us together in
this room, I mentioned to you that I could offer no opinion or advice
as to your interests while those interests were entrusted to another
member of the profession. And I spoke in such terms as I was bound to
speak of Kenge and Carboy's office, which stands high. You, sir,
thought fit to withdraw your interests from that keeping nevertheless
and to offer them to me. You brought them with clean hands, sir, and
I accepted them with clean hands. Those interests are now paramount
in this office. My digestive functions, as you may have heard me
mention, are not in a good state, and rest might improve them; but I
shall not rest, sir, while I am your representative. Whenever you
want me, you will find me here. Summon me anywhere, and I will come.
During the long vacation, sir, I shall devote my leisure to studying
your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for
moving heaven and earth -LRB-including, of course, the Chancellor-RRB- after
Michaelmas term; and when I ultimately congratulate you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>says
Mr. Vholes with the severity of a determined man, <div class="bookquote">``when I ultimately
congratulate you, sir, with all my heart, on your accession to
fortune--which, but that I never give hopes, I might say something
further about--you will owe me nothing beyond whatever little balance
may be then outstanding of the costs as between solicitor and client
not included in the taxed costs allowed out of the estate. I pretend
to no claim upon you, Mr. C., but for the zealous and active
discharge--not the languid and routine discharge, sir: that much
credit I stipulate for--of my professional duty. My duty prosperously
ended, all between us is ended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Vholes finally adds, by way of rider to this declaration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
principles, that as Mr. Carstone is about to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) regiment,
perhaps Mr. C. will favour him (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) with an order on his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) agent for twenty
pounds on account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For there have been many little consultations and attendances of
late, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observes Vholes, turning over the leaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) diary,
<div class="bookquote">``and these things mount up, and I don't profess to be a man of
capital. When we first entered on our present relations I stated to
you openly--it is a principle of mine that there never can be too
much openness between solicitor and client--that I was not a man of
capital and that if capital was your object you had better leave your
papers in Kenge's office. No, Mr. C., you will find none of the
advantages or disadvantages of capital here, sir. This,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Vholes gives
the desk one hollow blow again, <div class="bookquote">``is your rock; it pretends to be
nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The client</b></font>)</div><p/>The client, with his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) dejection insensibly relieved and his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) vague
hopes rekindled, takes pen and ink and writes the draft, not without
perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear,
implying scant effects in the agent's hands. All the while, Vholes,
buttoned up in body and mind, looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) attentively. All the
while, Vholes's official cat watches the mouse's hole.

<p/>Lastly, the client, shaking hands, beseeches Mr. Vholes, for heaven's
sake and earth's sake, to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) utmost to <div class="bookquote">``pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) through''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>the
Court of Chancery. Mr. Vholes, who never gives hopes, lays his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) palm
upon the client's shoulder and answers with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``Always here,
sir. Personally, or by letter, you will always find me here, sir,
with my shoulder to the wheel.''  (<font color='red'><b>the client</b></font>)</div>Thus they part, and Vholes, left
alone, employs himself in carrying sundry little matters out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
diary into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) draft bill book for the ultimate behoof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) three
daughters. So might an industrious fox or bear make up his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) account of
chickens or stray travellers with an eye to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) cubs, not to
disparage by that word the three raw-visaged, lank, and buttoned-up
maidens who dwell with the parent Vholes in an earthy cottage
situated in a damp garden at Kennington.

<p/>Richard, emerging from the heavy shade of Symond's Inn into the
sunshine of Chancery Lane--for there happens to be sunshine there
to-day--walks thoughtfully on, and turns into Lincoln's Inn, and
passes under the shadow of the Lincoln's Inn trees. On many such
loungers have the speckled shadows of those trees often fallen; on
the like bent head, the bitten nail, the lowering eye, the lingering
step, the purposeless and dreamy air, the good consuming and
consumed, the life turned sour. This lounger is not shabby yet, but
that may come. Chancery, which knows no wisdom but in precedent, is
very rich in such precedents; and why should one be different from
ten thousand?

<p/>Yet the time is so short since his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) depreciation began that as he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>)
saunters away, reluctant to leave the spot for some long months
together, though he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) hates it, Richard himself may feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own case
as if it were a startling one. While his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) heart is heavy with
corroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt, it may have room for
some sorrowful wonder when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) recalls how different his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) first visit
there, how different he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), how different all the colours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind.
But injustice breeds injustice; the fighting with shadows and being
defeated by them necessitates the setting up of substances to combat;
from the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand, the time
for that being long gone by, it has become a gloomy relief to turn to
the palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from this
ruin and make HIM his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) enemy. Richard has told Vholes the truth. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
in a hardened or a softened mood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) still lays his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) injuries equally
at that door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was thwarted, in that quarter, of a set purpose, and
that purpose could only originate in the one subject that is
resolving his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) existence into itself; besides, it is a justification
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own eyes to have an embodied antagonist and oppressor.

<p/>Is Richard a monster in all this, or would Chancery be found rich in
such precedents too if they could be got for citation from the
Recording Angel?

<p/>Two pairs of eyes not unused to such people look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), as,
biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) nails and brooding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) crosses the square and is swallowed
up by the shadow of the southern gateway. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle
are the possessors of those eyes, and they have been leaning in
conversation against the low stone parapet under the trees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) passes
close by them, seeing nothing but the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Weevle, adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) whiskers, <div class="bookquote">``there's
combustion going on there! It's not a case of spontaneous, but it's
smouldering combustion it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wouldn't keep out of Jarndyce, and I
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)'s over head and ears in debt. I never knew much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
was as high as the monument when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) was on trial at our place. A good
riddance to me, whether as clerk or client! Well, Tony, that as I was
mentioning is what they're up to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy, refolding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) arms, resettles himself against the parapet,
as resuming a conversation of interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are still up to it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``still taking stock,
still examining papers, still going over the heaps and heaps of
rubbish. At this rate they'll be at it these seven years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Small is helping?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Small left us at a week's notice. Told Kenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) grandfather's
business was too much for the old gentleman and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could better
himself by undertaking it. There had been a coolness between myself
and Small on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) being so close. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) said you and I
began it, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had me there--for we did--I put our acquaintance
on the old footing. That's how I come to know what they're up to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't looked in at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy, a little disconcerted, <div class="bookquote">``to be unreserved with
you, I don't greatly relish the house, except in your company, and
therefore I have not; and therefore I proposed this little
appointment for our fetching away your things. There goes the hour by
the clock! Tony'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Guppy becomes mysteriously and tenderly
eloquent--<div class="bookquote">``it is necessary that I should impress upon your mind once
more that circumstances over which I have no control have made a
melancholy alteration in my most cherished plans and in that
unrequited image which I formerly mentioned to you as a friend. That
image is shattered, and that idol is laid low. My only wish now in
connexion with the objects which I had an idea of carrying out in the
court with your aid as a friend is to let 'em alone and bury 'em in
oblivion. Do you think it possible, do you think it at all likely -LRB-I
put it to you, Tony, as a friend-RRB-, from your knowledge of that
capricious and deep old character who fell a prey to the--spontaneous
element, do you, Tony, think it at all likely that on second thoughts
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) put those letters away anywhere, after you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) alive, and that
they were not destroyed that night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weevle reflects for some time. Shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) head. Decidedly thinks
not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Guppy as they walk towards the court, <div class="bookquote">``once again
understand me, as a friend. Without entering into further
explanations, I may repeat that the idol is down. I have no purpose
to serve now but burial in oblivion. To that I have pledged myself. I
owe it to myself, and I owe it to the shattered image, as also to the
circumstances over which I have no control. If you was to express to
me by a gesture, by a wink, that you saw lying anywhere in your late
lodgings any papers that so much as looked like the papers in
question, I would pitch them into the fire, sir, on my own
responsibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weevle nods. Mr. Guppy, much elevated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) own opinion by
having delivered these observations, with an air in part forensic and
in part romantic--this gentleman having a passion for conducting
anything in the form of an examination, or delivering anything in the
form of a summing up or a speech--accompanies his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend with dignity
to the court.

<p/>Never since it has been a court has it had such a Fortunatus' purse
of gossip as in the proceedings at the rag and bottle shop.
Regularly, every morning at eight, is the elder Mr. Smallweed brought
down to the corner and carried in, accompanied by Mrs. Smallweed,
Judy, and Bart; and regularly, all day, do they all remain there
until nine at night, solaced by gipsy dinners, not abundant in
quantity, from the cook's shop, rummaging and searching, digging,
delving, and diving among the treasures of the late lamented. What
those treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened.
In its delirium it imagines guineas pouring out of tea-pots,
crown-pieces overflowing punch-bowls, old chairs and mattresses
stuffed with Bank of England notes. It possesses itself of the
sixpenny history -LRB-with highly coloured folding frontispiece-RRB- of Mr.
Daniel Dancer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sister, and also of Mr. Elwes, of Suffolk, and
transfers all the facts from those authentic narratives to Mr. Krook.
Twice when the dustman is called in to carry off a cartload of old
paper, ashes, and broken bottles, the whole court assembles and pries
into the baskets as they come forth. Many times the two gentlemen who
write with the ravenous little pens on the tissue-paper are seen
prowling in the neighbourhood--shy of each other, their late
partnership being dissolved. The Sol skilfully carries a vein of the
prevailing interest through the Harmonic nights. Little Swills, in
what are professionally known as <div class="bookquote">``patter''  (<font color='red'><b>the vocalist gags</b></font>)</div>allusions to the subject,
is received with loud applause; and the same vocalist <div class="bookquote">``gags''  (<font color='red'><b>the vocalist gags</b></font>)</div>in the
regular business like a man inspired. Even Miss M. Melvilleson, in
the revived Caledonian melody of <div class="bookquote">``We're a-Nodding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss M. Melvilleson</b></font>)</div>points the
sentiment that <div class="bookquote">``the dogs love broo''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss M. Melvilleson</b></font>)</div>-LRB-whatever the nature of that
refreshment may be-RRB- with such archness and such a turn of the head
towards next door that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melvilleson</b></font>) is immediately understood to mean Mr.
Smallweed loves to find money, and is nightly honoured with a double
encore. For all this, the court discovers nothing; and as Mrs. Piper
and Mrs. Perkins now communicate to the late lodger whose appearance
is the signal for a general rally, it is in one continual ferment to
discover everything, and more.

<p/>Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy, with every eye in the court's head upon
them, knock at the closed door of the late lamented's house, in a
high state of popularity. But being contrary to the court's
expectation admitted, they immediately become unpopular and are
considered to mean no good.

<p/>The shutters are more or less closed all over the house, and the
ground-floor is sufficiently dark to require candles. Introduced into
the back shop by Mr. Smallweed the younger, they, fresh from the
sunlight, can at first see nothing save darkness and shadows; but
they gradually discern the elder Mr. Smallweed seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) chair
upon the brink of a well or grave of waste-paper, the virtuous Judy
groping therein like a female sexton, and Mrs. Smallweed on the level
ground in the vicinity snowed up in a heap of paper fragments, print,
and manuscript which would appear to be the accumulated compliments
that have been sent flying at her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) in the course of the day. The whole
party, Small included, are blackened with dust and dirt and present a
fiendish appearance not relieved by the general aspect of the room.
There is more litter and lumber in it than of old, and it is dirtier
if possible; likewise, it is ghostly with traces of its dead
inhabitant and even with his (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) chalked writing on the wall.

<p/>On the entrance of visitors, Mr. Smallweed and Judy simultaneously
fold their arms and stop in their researches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>croaks the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``How de do, gentlemen, how de do!
Come to fetch your property, Mr. Weevle? That's well, that's well.
Ha! Ha! We should have been forced to sell you up, sir, to pay your
warehouse room if you had left it here much longer. You feel quite at
home here again, I dare say? Glad to see you, glad to see you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weevle, thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>), casts an eye about. Mr. Guppy's eye follows
Mr. Weevle's eye. Mr. Weevle's eye comes back without any new
intelligence in it. Mr. Guppy's eye comes back and meets Mr.
Smallweed's eye. That engaging old gentleman is still murmuring, like
some wound-up instrument running down, <div class="bookquote">``How de do, sir--how
de--how--''  (<font color='red'><b>That gentleman</b></font>)</div>And then having run down, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lapses into grinning silence,
as Mr. Guppy starts at seeing Mr. Tulkinghorn standing in the
darkness opposite with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentleman so kind as to act as my solicitor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>says Grandfather
Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``I am not the sort of client for a gentleman of such note,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is so good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy, slightly nudging his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend to take another look, makes a
shuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn, who returns it with an easy nod.
Mr. Tulkinghorn is looking on as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had nothing else to do and
were rather amused by the novelty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good deal of property here, sir, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy observes
to Mr. Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Principally rags and rubbish, my dear friend! Rags and rubbish! Me
and Bart and my granddaughter Judy are endeavouring to make out an
inventory of what's worth anything to sell. But we haven't come to
much as yet; we--haven't--come--to--hah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed has run down again, while Mr. Weevle's eye, attended by
Mr. Guppy's eye, has again gone round the room and come back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weevle/Weevle</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Weevle. <div class="bookquote">``We won't intrude any longer if you'll
allow us to go upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere, my dear sir, anywhere! You're at home. Make yourself so,
pray!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>As they go upstairs, Mr. Guppy lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) eyebrows inquiringly and
looks at Tony. Tony shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) head. They find the old room very dull
and dismal, with the ashes of the fire that was burning on that
memorable night yet in the discoloured grate. They have a great
disinclination to touch any object, and carefully blow the dust from
it first. Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit, packing the
few movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a
whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony/Jobling/Tony Jobling</b></font>)</div>says Tony, recoiling. <div class="bookquote">``Here's that horrible cat coming
in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy retreats behind a chair. <div class="bookquote">``Small told me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) went
leaping and bounding and tearing about that night like a dragon, and
got out on the house-top, and roamed about up there for a fortnight,
and then came tumbling down the chimney very thin. Did you ever see
such a brute? Looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) knew all about it, don't she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)? Almost
looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) was Krook. Shoohoo! Get out, you goblin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Jane/Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Jane, in the doorway, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tiger snarl from ear to ear and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) club of a tail, shows no intention of obeying; but Mr.
Tulkinghorn stumbling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) spits at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) rusty legs, and
swearing wrathfully, takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) arched back upstairs. Possibly to roam
the house-tops again and return by the chimney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, <div class="bookquote">``could I have a word with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy is engaged in collecting the Galaxy Gallery of British
Beauty from the wall and depositing those works of art in their old
ignoble band-box. <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) returns, reddening, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to act with
courtesy towards every member of the profession, and especially, I am
sure, towards a member of it so well known as yourself--I will truly
add, sir, so distinguished as yourself. Still, Mr. Tulkinghorn, sir,
I must stipulate that if you have any word with me, that word is
spoken in the presence of my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. My reasons are not of a personal nature at all, but they

conditions, Mr. Guppy.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pauses here to smile, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) smile is as
dull and rusty as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pantaloons. <div class="bookquote">``You are to be congratulated, Mr.

reddening ears to be one of those people at present instead of
himself, replies, <div class="bookquote">``Sir, if I attend to my profession and do what is

sir, and without offence--I repeat, without offence--''

 (<font color='red'><b>those people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--I don't intend to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a calm nod. <div class="bookquote">``Very good; I see
by these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable
great, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) addresses this to the astounded Tony, who admits the soft
impeachment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A virtue in which few Englishmen are deficient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>observes Mr.
Tulkinghorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has been standing on the hearthstone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) back to
the smoked chimney-piece, and now turns round with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) glasses to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
eyes. ``Who is this? ``Lady Dedlock.<div class="bookquote">'' Ha! A very good likeness in its
way, but it wants force of character. Good day to you, gentlemen;
good day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has walked out, Mr. Guppy, in a great perspiration, nerves
himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the Galaxy
Gallery, concluding with Lady Dedlock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) says hurriedly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) astonished companion, <div class="bookquote">``let us be
quick in putting the things together and in getting out of this
place. It were in vain longer to conceal from you, Tony, that between
myself and one of the members of a swan-like aristocracy whom I now
hold in my hand, there has been undivulged communication and
association. The time might have been when I might have revealed it
to you. It never will be more. It is due alike to the oath I have
taken, alike to the shattered idol, and alike to circumstances over
which I have no control, that the whole should be buried in oblivion.
I charge you as a friend, by the interest you have ever testified in
the fashionable intelligence, and by any little advances with which I
may have been able to accommodate you, so to bury it without a word
of inquiry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>This charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic
lunacy, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend shows a dazed mind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) whole head of hair
and even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) cultivated whiskers.




<p/>CHAPTER XL

<p/>National and Domestic


<p/>England has been in a dreadful state for some weeks. Lord Coodle
would go out, Sir Thomas Doodle wouldn't come in, and there being
nobody in Great Britain -LRB-to speak of-RRB- except Coodle and Doodle, there
has been no government. It is a mercy that the hostile meeting
between those two great men, which at one time seemed inevitable, did
not come off, because if both pistols had taken effect, and Coodle
and Doodle had killed each other, it is to be presumed that England
must have waited to be governed until young Coodle and young Doodle,
now in frocks and long stockings, were grown up. This stupendous
national calamity, however, was averted by Lord Coodle's making the
timely discovery that if in the heat of debate he (<font color='blue'><b>Coodle</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coodle</b></font>)
scorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) to withhold from it the tribute of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) warmest admiration; while
it as opportunely turned out, on the other hand, that Sir Thomas
Doodle had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down
to posterity as the mirror of virtue and honour. Still England has
been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot -LRB-as was well
observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock-RRB- to weather the storm; and the
marvellous part of the matter is that England has not appeared to
care very much about it, but has gone on eating and drinking and
marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days
before the flood. But Coodle knew the danger, and Doodle knew the
danger, and all their followers and hangers-on had the clearest
possible perception of the danger. At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not
only condescended to come in, but has done it handsomely, bringing in
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) nephews, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) male cousins, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>)
brothers-in-law. So there is hope for the old ship yet.

<p/>Doodle has found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) must throw himself upon the country, chiefly
in the form of sovereigns and beer. In this metamorphosed state he (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) is
available in a good many places simultaneously and can throw himself
upon a considerable portion of the country at one time. Britannia
being much occupied in pocketing Doodle in the form of sovereigns,
and swallowing Doodle in the form of beer, and in swearing herself
black in the face that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) does neither--plainly to the advancement
of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) glory and morality--the London season comes to a sudden end,
through all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist
Britannia in those religious exercises.

<p/>Hence Mrs. Rouncewell, housekeeper at Chesney Wold, foresees, though
no instructions have yet come down, that the family may shortly be
expected, together with a pretty large accession of cousins and
others who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work. And
hence the stately old dame, taking Time by the forelock, leads him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) up
and down the staircases, and along the galleries and passages, and
through the rooms, to witness before he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) grows any older that
everything is ready, that floors are rubbed bright, carpets spread,
curtains shaken out, beds puffed and patted, still-room and kitchen
cleared for action--all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock
dignity.

<p/>This present summer evening, as the sun goes down, the preparations
are complete. Dreary and solemn the old house looks, with so many
appliances of habitation and with no inhabitants except the pictured
forms upon the walls. So did these come and go, a Dedlock in
possession might have ruminated passing along; so did they see this
gallery hushed and quiet, as I see it now; so think, as I think, of
the gap that they would make in this domain when they were gone; so
find it, as I find it, difficult to believe that it could be without
them; so pass from my world, as I pass from theirs, now closing the
reverberating door; so leave no blank to miss them, and so die.

<p/>Through some of the fiery windows beautiful from without, and set, at
this sunset hour, not in dull-grey stone but in a glorious house of
gold, the light excluded at other windows pours in rich, lavish,
overflowing like the summer plenty in the land. Then do the frozen
Dedlocks thaw. Strange movements come upon their features as the
shadows of leaves play there. A dense justice in a corner is beguiled
into a wink. A staring baronet, with a truncheon, gets a dimple in
his (<font color='blue'><b>baronet</b></font>) chin. Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a
fleck of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred
years ago. One ancestress of Volumnia, in high-heeled shoes, very
like her (<font color='blue'><b>baronet</b></font>)--casting the shadow of that virgin event before her (<font color='blue'><b>baronet</b></font>) full two
centuries--shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint. A maid of
honour of the court of Charles the Second, with large round eyes -LRB-and
other charms to correspond-RRB-, seems to bathe in glowing water, and it
ripples as it glows.

<p/>But the fire of the sun is dying. Even now the floor is dusky, and
shadow slowly mounts the walls, bringing the Dedlocks down like age
and death. And now, upon my Lady's picture over the great
chimney-piece, a weird shade falls from some old tree, that turns it
pale, and flutters it, and looks as if a great arm held a veil or
hood, watching an opportunity to draw it over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). Higher and darker
rises shadow on the wall--now a red gloom on the ceiling--now the
fire is out.

<p/>All that prospect, which from the terrace looked so near, has moved
solemnly away and changed--not the first nor the last of beautiful
things that look so near and will so change--into a distant phantom.
Light mists arise, and the dew falls, and all the sweet scents in the
garden are heavy in the air. Now the woods settle into great masses
as if they were each one profound tree. And now the moon rises to
separate them, and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines
behind their stems, and to make the avenue a pavement of light among
high cathedral arches fantastically broken.

<p/>Now the moon is high; and the great house, needing habitation more
than ever, is like a body without life. Now it is even awful,
stealing through it, to think of the live people who have slept in
the solitary bedrooms, to say nothing of the dead. Now is the time
for shadow, when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a
pit, when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon
the floors, when anything and everything can be made of the heavy
staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes, when the armour
has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy
movement, and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads
inside. But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold, the shadow in the
long drawing-room upon my Lady's picture is the first to come, the
last to be disturbed. At this hour and by this light it changes into
threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every
breath that stirs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is not well, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>a groom</b></font>)</div>says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell's
audience-chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady not well! What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my Lady has been but poorly, ma'am, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was last here--I
don't mean with the family, ma'am, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was here as a bird of
passage like. My Lady has not been out much, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and has kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) room a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chesney Wold, Thomas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>rejoins the housekeeper with proud
complacency, <div class="bookquote">``will set my Lady up! There is no finer air and no
healthier soil in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomas may have his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own personal opinions on this subject, probably
hints them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) manner of smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sleek head from the nape of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) neck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) temples, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) forbears to express them further and
retires to the servants' hall to regale on cold meat-pie and ale.

<p/>This groom is the pilot-fish before the nobler shark. Next evening,
down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue, and
down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass.
Thenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men
with no names, who fly about all those particular parts of the
country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an
auriferous and malty shower, but who are merely persons of a restless
disposition and never do anything anywhere.

<p/>On these national occasions Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful. A
better man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at
dinner, there could not possibly be. Better got up gentlemen than the
other cousins to ride over to polling-booths and hustings here and
there, and show themselves on the side of England, it would be hard
to find. Volumnia is a little dim, but she (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) is of the true descent;
and there are many who appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) sprightly conversation, her (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>)
French conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time
almost new again, the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner,
or even the privilege of her (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) hand in the dance. On these national
occasions dancing may be a patriotic service, and Volumnia is
constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and
unpensioning country.

<p/>My Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests, and
being still unwell, rarely appears until late in the day. But at all
the dismal dinners, leaden lunches, basilisk balls, and other
melancholy pageants, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mere appearance is a relief. As to Sir
Leicester, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be
wanting, in any direction, by any one who has the good fortune to be
received under that roof; and in a state of sublime satisfaction, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>)
moves among the company, a magnificent refrigerator.

<p/>Daily the cousins trot through dust and canter over roadside turf,
away to hustings and polling-booths -LRB-with leather gloves and
hunting-whips for the counties and kid gloves and riding-canes for
the boroughs-RRB-, and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester
holds forth after dinner. Daily the restless men who have no
occupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy. Daily
Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state
of the nation, from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that
Volumnia is a more reflecting woman than he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are we getting on?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Miss Volumnia, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``ARE
we safe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doodle/Thomas Doodle/Thomas</b></font>)</div><p/>The mighty business is nearly over by this time, and Doodle will
throw himself off the country in a few days more. Sir Leicester has
just appeared in the long drawing-room after dinner, a bright
particular star surrounded by clouds of cousins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Volumnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replies Sir Leicester, who has a list in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``we
are doing tolerably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only tolerably!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Although it is summer weather, Sir Leicester always has his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) own
particular fire in the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) usual screened seat near
it and repeats with much firmness and a little displeasure, as who
should say, I am not a common man, and when I say tolerably, it must
not be understood as a common expression, <div class="bookquote">``Volumnia, we are doing
tolerably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At least there is no opposition to YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Volumnia asserts with
confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Volumnia. This distracted country has lost its senses in many
respects, I grieve to say, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so mad as that. I am glad to hear it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia's finishing the sentence restores her (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle</b></font>) to favour. Sir
Leicester, with a gracious inclination of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, seems to say to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``A sensible woman this, on the whole, though occasionally
precipitate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, as to this question of opposition, the fair Dedlock's
observation was superfluous, Sir Leicester on these occasions always
delivering in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own candidateship, as a kind of handsome wholesale
order to be promptly executed. Two other little seats that belong to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treats as retail orders of less importance, merely sending
down the men and signifying to the tradespeople, <div class="bookquote">``You will have the
goodness to make these materials into two members of Parliament and
to send them home when done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the tradespeople</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I regret to say, Volumnia, that in many places the people have shown
a bad spirit, and that this opposition to the government has been of
a most determined and most implacable description.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``W-r-retches!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Volumnia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousins</b></font>)</div>proceeds Sir Leicester, glancing at the circumjacent cousins
on sofas and ottomans, <div class="bookquote">``even in many--in fact, in most--of those
places in which the government has carried it against a faction--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cousins</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Note, by the way, that the Coodleites are always a faction with the
Doodleites, and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position
towards the Coodleites.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--Even in them I am shocked, for the credit of Englishmen, to be
constrained to inform you that the party has not triumphed without
being put to an enormous expense. Hundreds,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousins</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester,
eyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and swelling indignation,
<div class="bookquote">``hundreds of thousands of pounds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cousins</b></font>)</div><p/>If Volumnia have a fault, it is the fault of being a trifle too
innocent, seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well
with a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and
pearl necklace. Howbeit, impelled by innocence, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asks, <div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Volumnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>remonstrates Sir Leicester with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) utmost severity.
<div class="bookquote">``Volumnia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I don't mean what for,''  (<font color='red'><b>scream</b></font>)</div>cries Volumnia with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) favourite
little scream. <div class="bookquote">``How stupid I am! I mean what a pity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``that you do mean what a pity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia hastens to express her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) opinion that the shocking people
ought to be tried as traitors and made to support the party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad, Volumnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeats Sir Leicester, unmindful of these
mollifying sentiments, <div class="bookquote">``that you do mean what a pity. It is
disgraceful to the electors. But as you, though inadvertently and
without intending so unreasonable a question, asked me `what for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>let me reply to you. For necessary expenses. And I trust to your good
sense, Volumnia, not to pursue the subject, here or elsewhere.''

<p/>Sir Leicester feels it incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to observe a crushing aspect
towards Volumnia because it is whispered abroad that these necessary
expenses will, in some two hundred election petitions, be
unpleasantly connected with the word bribery, and because some
graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the
Church service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the High
Court of Parliament and have recommended instead that the prayers of
the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty-eight
gentlemen in a very unhealthy state.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>observes Volumnia, having taken a little time to recover
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spirits after her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) late castigation, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mr. Tulkinghorn
has been worked to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``why Mr.
Tulkinghorn should be worked to death. I don't know what Mr.
Tulkinghorn's engagements may be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is not a candidate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might have been employed. Sir Leicester could
desire to know by whom, and what for. Volumnia, abashed again,
suggests, by somebody--to advise and make arrangements. Sir Leicester
is not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) assistance.

<p/>Lady Dedlock, seated at an open window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) arm upon its
cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the
park, has seemed to attend since the lawyer's name was mentioned.

<p/>A languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility now
observes from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) couch that man told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) ya'as`dy that Tulkinghorn
had gone down t' that iron place t' give legal `pinion `bout
something, and that contest being over t' day, `twould be highly
jawlly thing if Tulkinghorn should `pear with news that Coodle man
was floored.

<p/>Mercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester, hereupon,
that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner. My Lady turns
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head inward for the moment, then looks out again as before.

<p/>Volumnia is charmed to hear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) delight is come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is so
original, such a stolid creature, such an immense being for knowing
all sorts of things and never telling them! Volumnia is persuaded
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) must be a Freemason. Is sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is at the head of a lodge,
and wears short aprons, and is made a perfect idol of with
candlesticks and trowels. These lively remarks the fair Dedlock
delivers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) youthful manner, while making a purse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has not been here once,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) adds, <div class="bookquote">``since I came. I really had
some thoughts of breaking my heart for the inconstant creature. I had
almost made up my mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) was dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It may be the gathering gloom of evening, or it may be the darker
gloom within herself, but a shade is on my Lady's face, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
thought, <div class="bookquote">``I would he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) were!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulkinghorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``is always welcome here and
always discreet wheresoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is. A very valuable person, and
deservedly respected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>The debilitated cousin supposes he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">''`normously rich fler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has a stake in the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``I have no
doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is, of course, handsomely paid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) associates almost on
a footing of equality with the highest society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody starts. For a gun is fired close by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious, what's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>scream</b></font>)</div>cries Volumnia with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) little withered
scream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A rat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady. <div class="bookquote">``And they have shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Enter Mr. Tulkinghorn, followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Leicester</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``I think not. My Lady, do you object to
the twilight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sir Leicester</b></font>)</div><p/>On the contrary, my Lady prefers it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Volumnia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh! Nothing is so delicious to Volumnia as to sit and talk in the
dark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then take them away,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Tulkinghorn, I beg your
pardon. How do you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) usual leisurely ease advances, renders his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
passing homage to my Lady, shakes Sir Leicester's hand, and subsides
into the chair proper to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has anything to communicate, on
the opposite side of the Baronet's little newspaper-table. Sir
Leicester is apprehensive that my Lady, not being very well, will
take cold at that open window. My Lady is obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), but would
rather sit there for the air. Sir Leicester rises, adjusts her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) scarf
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) seat. Mr. Tulkinghorn in the meanwhile
takes a pinch of snuff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``How has that contest gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hollow from the beginning. Not a chance. They have brought in
both their people. You are beaten out of all reason. Three to one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>It is a part of Mr. Tulkinghorn's policy and mastery to have no
political opinions; indeed, NO opinions. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says <div class="bookquote">``you''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>are
beaten, and not <div class="bookquote">``we.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester is majestically wroth. Volumnia never heard of such a
thing. ``The debilitated cousin holds that it's sort of thing that's

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the place, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the
fast-increasing darkness when there is silence again, <div class="bookquote">``where they
wanted to put up Mrs. Rouncewell's son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A proposal which, as you correctly informed me at the time, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had
the becoming taste and perception,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``to
decline. I cannot say that I by any means approve of the sentiments
expressed by Mr. Rouncewell when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) was here for some half-hour in

am glad to acknowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn. <div class="bookquote">``It did not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) from being very
active in this election, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking. <div class="bookquote">``Did I
understand you? Did you say that Mr. Rouncewell had been very active
in this election?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncommonly active.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Against--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear yes, against you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) is a very good speaker. Plain and
emphatic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) made a damaging effect, and has great influence. In the
business part of the proceedings he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) carried all before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>It is evident to the whole company, though nobody can see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), that
Sir Leicester is staring majestically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) was much assisted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn as a wind-up, <div class="bookquote">``by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) son, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeats Sir Leicester with awful politeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The son who wished to marry the young woman in my Lady's service?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has but one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then upon my honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester after a terrific pause
during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has been heard to snort and felt to stare, <div class="bookquote">``then
upon my honour, upon my life, upon my reputation and principles,
the floodgates of society are burst open, and the waters
have--a--obliterated the landmarks of the framework of the cohesion
by which things are held together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>General burst of cousinly indignation. Volumnia thinks it is
really high time, you know, for somebody in power to step in
and do something strong. Debilitated cousin thinks--country's
going--Dayvle--steeple-chase pace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester in a breathless condition, <div class="bookquote">``that we may
not comment further on this circumstance. Comment is superfluous. My
Lady, let me suggest in reference to that young woman--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no intention,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>observes my Lady from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) window in a low but
decided tone, <div class="bookquote">``of parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was not my meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear
you say so. I would suggest that as you think her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) worthy of your
patronage, you should exert your influence to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from these

such association to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) duties and principles, and you might preserve
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a better fate. You might point out to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) probably
would, in good time, find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
not be--''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester adds, after a moment's consideration,
<div class="bookquote">``dragged from the altars of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forefathers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>These remarks he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) offers with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) unvarying politeness and deference
when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) addresses himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) merely moves her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head in
reply. The moon is rising, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sits there is a little
stream of cold pale light, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head is seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is worthy of remark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, <div class="bookquote">``however, that these
people are, in their way, very proud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proud?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester doubts his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the
girl--yes, lover and all--instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) abandoning them, supposing
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) remained at Chesney Wold under such circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester tremulously. <div class="bookquote">``Well! You should know, Mr.
Tulkinghorn. You have been among them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Sir Leicester,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>returns the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``I state the fact. Why,
I could tell you a story--with Lady Dedlock's permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head concedes it, and Volumnia is enchanted. A story! Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) is
going to tell something at last! A ghost in it, Volumnia hopes?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Real flesh and blood.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn stops for an instant and
repeats with some little emphasis grafted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) usual monotony,
<div class="bookquote">``Real flesh and blood, Miss Dedlock. Sir Leicester, these particulars
have only lately become known to me. They are very brief. They
exemplify what I have said. I suppress names for the present. Lady
Dedlock will not think me ill-bred, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>By the light of the fire, which is low, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) can be seen looking
towards the moonlight. By the light of the moon Lady Dedlock can be
seen, perfectly still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A townsman of this Mrs. Rouncewell, a man in exactly parallel
circumstances as I am told, had the good fortune to have a daughter
who attracted the notice of a great lady. I speak of really a great
lady, not merely great to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but married to a gentleman of your
condition, Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester condescendingly says, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Tulkinghorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>implying
that then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) must have appeared of very considerable moral
dimensions indeed in the eyes of an iron-master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady was wealthy and beautiful, and had a liking for the girl,
and treated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with great kindness, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always near her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Now this lady preserved a secret under all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) greatness, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had preserved for many years. In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had in early life been
engaged to marry a young rake--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) was a captain in the army--nothing
connected with whom came to any good. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never did marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), but
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave birth to a child of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) was the father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By the light of the fire he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) can be seen looking towards the
moonlight. By the moonlight, Lady Dedlock can be seen in profile,
perfectly still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The captain in the army being dead, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believed herself safe; but a
train of circumstances with which I need not trouble you led to
discovery. As I received the story, they began in an imprudence on
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own part one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was taken by surprise, which shows how
difficult it is for the firmest of us -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very firm-RRB- to be
always guarded. There was great domestic trouble and amazement, you
may suppose; I leave you to imagine, Sir Leicester, the husband's
grief. But that is not the present point. When Mr. Rouncewell's
townsman heard of the disclosure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) no more allowed the girl to be
patronized and honoured than he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) would have suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be trodden
underfoot before his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) eyes. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) pride, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) indignantly
took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away, as if from reproach and disgrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) had no sense of
the honour done him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) daughter by the lady's condescension; not
the least. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) resented the girl's position, as if the lady had been
the commonest of commoners. That is the story. I hope Lady Dedlock
will excuse its painful nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There are various opinions on the merits, more or less conflicting
with Volumnia's. That fair young creature cannot believe there ever
was any such lady and rejects the whole history on the threshold. The
majority incline to the debilitated cousin's sentiment, which is in
few words--<div class="bookquote">``no business--Rouncewell's fernal townsman.''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester
generally refers back in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mind to Wat Tyler and arranges a
sequence of events on a plan of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own.

<p/>There is not much conversation in all, for late hours have been kept
at Chesney Wold since the necessary expenses elsewhere began, and
this is the first night in many on which the family have been alone.
It is past ten when Sir Leicester begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to ring for
candles. Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake, and
then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves, and rises, and comes
forward to a table for a glass of water. Winking cousins, bat-like in
the candle glare, crowd round to give it; Volumnia -LRB-always ready for
something better if procurable-RRB- takes another, a very mild sip of
which contents her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>); Lady Dedlock, graceful, self-possessed, looked
after by admiring eyes, passes away slowly down the long perspective
by the side of that nymph, not at all improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) as a question of
contrast.




<p/>CHAPTER XLI

<p/>In Mr. Tulkinghorn's Room


<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn arrives in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) turret-room a little breathed by the
journey up, though leisurely performed. There is an expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
face as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had discharged his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) mind of some grave matter and were,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) close way, satisfied. To say of a man so severely and strictly
self-repressed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is triumphant would be to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) as great an
injustice as to suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) troubled with love or sentiment or any
romantic weakness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is sedately satisfied. Perhaps there is a
rather increased sense of power upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) loosely grasps one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) veinous wrists with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) other hand and holding it behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) back
walks noiselessly up and down.

<p/>There is a capacious writing-table in the room on which is a pretty
large accumulation of papers. The green lamp is lighted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
reading-glasses lie upon the desk, the easy-chair is wheeled up to
it, and it would seem as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had intended to bestow an hour or
so upon these claims on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) attention before going to bed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
happens not to be in a business mind. After a glance at the documents
awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) notice--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head bent low over the table, the old
man's sight for print or writing being defective at night--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) opens
the French window and steps out upon the leads. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) again walks
slowly up and down in the same attitude, subsiding, if a man so cool
may have any need to subside, from the story he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has related
downstairs.

<p/>The time was once when men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk
on turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read
their fortunes there. Hosts of stars are visible to-night, though
their brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) be
seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own star as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) methodically turns and turns upon the
leads, it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented
below. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) be tracing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) destiny, that may be written in other
characters nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hand.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) paces the leads with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) eyes most probably as high above his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
thoughts as they are high above the earth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is suddenly stopped in
passing the window by two eyes that meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own. The ceiling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
room is rather low; and the upper part of the door, which is opposite
the window, is of glass. There is an inner baize door, too, but the
night being warm he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) did not close it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) came upstairs. These
eyes that meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own are looking in through the glass from the
corridor outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) knows them well. The blood has not flushed into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
recognizes Lady Dedlock.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) steps into the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) comes in too, closing both the doors
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>). There is a wild disturbance--is it fear or anger?--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
eyes. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) carriage and all else she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) looks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) looked downstairs
two hours ago.

<p/>Is it fear or is it anger now? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) cannot be sure. Both might be as
pale, both as intent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) does not speak at first, nor even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has slowly dropped
into the easy-chair by the table. They look at each other, like two
pictures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have you told my story to so many persons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, it was necessary for me to inform you that I knew it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have you known it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have suspected it a long while--fully known it a little while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Months?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) stands before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) with one hand on a chair-back and the other in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill, exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has stood
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) at any time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) marriage. The same formal
politeness, the same composed deference that might as well be
defiance; the whole man the same dark, cold object, at the same
distance, which nothing has ever diminished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this true concerning the poor girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slightly inclines and advances his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head as not quite understanding
the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what you related. Is it true? Do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends know my story
also? Is it the town-talk yet? Is it chalked upon the walls and cried
in the streets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So! Anger, and fear, and shame. All three contending. What power this
woman has to keep these raging passions down! Mr. Tulkinghorn's
thoughts take such form as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) looks at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) ragged grey
eyebrows a hair's breadth more contracted than usual under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lady Dedlock. That was a hypothetical case, arising out of Sir
Leicester's unconsciously carrying the matter with so high a hand.
But it would be a real case if they knew--what we know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they do not know it yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I save the poor girl from injury before they know it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot give a
satisfactory opinion on that point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) thinks, with the interest of attentive curiosity, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
watches the struggle in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast, <div class="bookquote">``The power and force of this
woman are astonishing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says, for the moment obliged to set her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips with all the
energy she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may speak distinctly, <div class="bookquote">``I will make it
plainer. I do not dispute your hypothetical case. I anticipated it,
and felt its truth as strongly as you can do, when I saw Mr.
Rouncewell here. I knew very well that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) could have had the power
of seeing me as I was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) would consider the poor girl tarnished by
having for a moment been, although most innocently, the subject of my
great and distinguished patronage. But I have an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or
I should rather say--no longer belonging to this place--I had, and if
you can find so much consideration for the woman under your foot as
to remember that, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be very sensible of your mercy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn, profoundly attentive, throws this off with a shrug
of self-depreciation and contracts his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) eyebrows a little more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have prepared me for my exposure, and I thank you for that too.
Is there anything that you require of me? Is there any claim that I
can release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in
obtaining HIS (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) release by certifying to the exactness of your
discovery? I will write anything, here and now, that you will
dictate. I am ready to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would do it, thinks the lawyer, watchful of the firm hand
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes the pen!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not trouble you, Lady Dedlock. Pray spare yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have long expected this, as you know. I neither wish to spare
myself nor to be spared. You can do nothing worse to me than you have
done. Do what remains now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, there is nothing to be done. I will take leave to say
a few words when you have finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their need for watching one another should be over now, but they do
it all this time, and the stars watch them both through the opened
window. Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest, and
the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one. The narrow one! Where
are the digger and the spade, this peaceful night, destined to add
the last great secret to the many secrets of the Tulkinghorn
existence? Is the man born yet, is the spade wrought yet? Curious
questions to consider, more curious perhaps not to consider, under
the watching stars upon a summer night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of repentance or remorse or any feeling of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Lady Dedlock
presently proceeds, <div class="bookquote">``I say not a word. If I were not dumb, you would
be deaf. Let that go by. It is not for your ears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes a feint of offering a protest, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sweeps it away with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) disdainful hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of other and very different things I come to speak to you. My jewels
are all in their proper places of keeping. They will be found there.
So, my dresses. So, all the valuables I have. Some ready money I had
with me, please to say, but no large amount. I did not wear my own
dress, in order that I might avoid observation. I went to be
henceforward lost. Make this known. I leave no other charge with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, quite unmoved. <div class="bookquote">``I am
not sure that I understand you. You want--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be lost to all here. I leave Chesney Wold to-night. I go this
hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) rises, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), without moving
hand from chair-back or from old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill,
shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Not go as I have said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) very calmly replies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be? Have you
forgotten the stain and blot upon this place, and where it is, and
who it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lady Dedlock, not by any means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Without deigning to rejoin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) moves to the inner door and has it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) says to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), without himself stirring hand or foot
or raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, have the goodness to stop and
hear me, or before you reach the staircase I shall ring the
alarm-bell and rouse the house. And then I must speak out before
every guest and servant, every man and woman, in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) falters, trembles, and puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand
confusedly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) head. Slight tokens these in any one else, but when
so practised an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn's sees indecision for a moment
in such a subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) thoroughly knows its value.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) promptly says again, <div class="bookquote">``Have the goodness to hear me, Lady Dedlock,''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and motions to the chair from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has risen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hesitates, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) motions again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sits down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The relations between us are of an unfortunate description, Lady
Dedlock; but as they are not of my making, I will not apologize for
them. The position I hold in reference to Sir Leicester is so well
known to you that I can hardly imagine but that I must long have
appeared in your eyes the natural person to make this discovery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) returns without looking up from the ground on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
eyes are now fixed, <div class="bookquote">``I had better have gone. It would have been far
better not to have detained me. I have no more to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Lady Dedlock, if I add a little more to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to hear it at the window, then. I can't breathe where I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) jealous glance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) walks that way betrays an instant's
misgiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) may have it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) thoughts to leap over, and
dashing against ledge and cornice, strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) life out upon the
terrace below. But a moment's observation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) figure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) stands
in the window without any support, looking out at the stars--not
up--gloomily out at those stars which are low in the heavens,
reassures him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>). By facing round as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has moved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) stands a little
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, I have not yet been able to come to a decision
satisfactory to myself on the course before me. I am not clear what
to do or how to act next. I must request you, in the meantime, to
keep your secret as you have kept it so long and not to wonder that I
keep it too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pauses, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) makes no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, Lady Dedlock. This is an important subject. You are
honouring me with your attention?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. I might have known it from what I have seen of your
strength of character. I ought not to have asked the question, but I
have the habit of making sure of my ground, step by step, as I go on.
The sole consideration in this unhappy case is Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) asks in a low voice and without removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) gloomy
look from those distant stars, <div class="bookquote">``do you detain me in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) IS the consideration. Lady Dedlock, I have no occasion to
tell you that Sir Leicester is a very proud man, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reliance
upon you is implicit, that the fall of that moon out of the sky would
not amaze him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than your fall from your high position as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) breathes quickly and heavily, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) stands as unflinchingly as
ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) grandest company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare to you, Lady Dedlock, that with anything short of this
case that I have, I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of
my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to
shake your hold upon Sir Leicester and Sir Leicester's trust and
confidence in you. And even now, with this case, I hesitate. Not that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could doubt -LRB-that, even with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), is impossible-RRB-, but that nothing
can prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the blow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not my flight?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``Think of it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There is a quiet decision in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) reply which admits of no
remonstrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I speak of Sir Leicester being the sole consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and

patrimony'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Tulkinghorn very dry here--<div class="bookquote">``are, I need not say to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) case in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) jog-trot
style, <div class="bookquote">``I have much to consider. This is to be hushed up if it can
be. How can it be, if Sir Leicester is driven out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) wits or laid
upon a death-bed? If I inflicted this shock upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) to-morrow
morning, how could the immediate change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) be accounted for? What
could have caused it? What could have divided you? Lady Dedlock, the
wall-chalking and the street-crying would come on directly, and you
are to remember that it would not affect you merely -LRB-whom I cannot at
all consider in this business-RRB- but your husband, Lady Dedlock, your
husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) gets plainer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) gets on, but not an atom more emphatic or
animated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is another point of view,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) continues, <div class="bookquote">``in which the case
presents itself. Sir Leicester is devoted to you almost to
infatuation. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might not be able to overcome that infatuation, even
knowing what we know. I am putting an extreme case, but it might be
so. If so, it were better that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew nothing. Better for common
sense, better for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), better for me. I must take all this into
account, and it combines to render a decision very difficult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) stands looking out at the same stars without a word. They are
beginning to pale, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) looks as if their coldness froze her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My experience teaches me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who has by this
time got his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pockets and is going on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) business
consideration of the matter like a machine. <div class="bookquote">``My experience teaches
me, Lady Dedlock, that most of the people I know would do far better
to leave marriage alone. It is at the bottom of three fourths of
their troubles. So I thought when Sir Leicester married, and so I

by circumstances. In the meanwhile I must beg you to keep your own
counsel, and I will keep mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure,
day by day?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) asks, still looking at the distant sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am afraid so, Lady Dedlock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is necessary, you think, that I should be so tied to the stake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure that what I recommend is necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to remain on this gaudy platform on which my miserable
deception has been so long acted, and it is to fall beneath me when
you give the signal?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) said slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not without notice, Lady Dedlock. I shall take no step without
forewarning you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) asks all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) questions as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) were repeating them from memory
or calling them over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are to meet as usual?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely as usual, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you have done so many years. I should not have made that
reference myself, Lady Dedlock, but I may now remind you that your
secret can be no heavier to you than it was, and is no worse and no
better than it was. I know it certainly, but I believe we have never
wholly trusted each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) stands absorbed in the same frozen way for some little time
before asking, <div class="bookquote">``Is there anything more to be said to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn returns methodically as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) softly rubs his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
hands, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to be assured of your acquiescence in my
arrangements, Lady Dedlock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be assured of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. And I would wish in conclusion to remind you, as a business
precaution, in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any
communication with Sir Leicester, that throughout our interview I
have expressly stated my sole consideration to be Sir Leicester's
feelings and honour and the family reputation. I should have been
happy to have made Lady Dedlock a prominent consideration, too, if
the case had admitted of it; but unfortunately it does not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can attest your fidelity, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Both before and after saying it she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) remains absorbed, but at length
moves, and turns, unshaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) natural and acquired presence,
towards the door. Mr. Tulkinghorn opens both the doors exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
would have done yesterday, or as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) would have done ten years ago,
and makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) old-fashioned bow as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) passes out. It is not an
ordinary look that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) receives from the handsome face as it goes into
the darkness, and it is not an ordinary movement, though a very
slight one, that acknowledges his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) courtesy. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) reflects when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is left alone, the woman has been putting no common constraint
upon herself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) would know it all the better if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) saw the woman pacing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
rooms with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair wildly thrown from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flung-back face, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands
clasped behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure twisted as if by pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) would
think so all the more if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) saw the woman thus hurrying up and down
for hours, without fatigue, without intermission, followed by the
faithful step upon the Ghost's Walk. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) shuts out the now chilled
air, draws the window-curtain, goes to bed, and falls asleep. And
truly when the stars go out and the wan day peeps into the
turret-chamber, finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) oldest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) looks as if the digger
and the spade were both commissioned and would soon be digging.

<p/>The same wan day peeps in at Sir Leicester pardoning the repentant
country in a majestically condescending dream; and at the cousins
entering on various public employments, principally receipt of
salary; and at the chaste Volumnia, bestowing a dower of fifty
thousand pounds upon a hideous old general with a mouth of false
teeth like a pianoforte too full of keys, long the admiration of Bath
and the terror of every other community. Also into rooms high in the
roof, and into offices in court-yards, and over stables, where
humbler ambition dreams of bliss, in keepers' lodges, and in holy
matrimony with Will or Sally. Up comes the bright sun, drawing
everything up with it--the Wills and Sallys, the latent vapour in the
earth, the drooping leaves and flowers, the birds and beasts and
creeping things, the gardeners to sweep the dewy turf and unfold
emerald velvet where the roller passes, the smoke of the great
kitchen fire wreathing itself straight and high into the lightsome
air. Lastly, up comes the flag over Mr. Tulkinghorn's unconscious
head cheerfully proclaiming that Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are
in their happy home and that there is hospitality at the place in
Lincolnshire.




<p/>CHAPTER XLII

<p/>In Mr. Tulkinghorn's Chambers


<p/>From the verdant undulations and the spreading oaks of the Dedlock
property, Mr. Tulkinghorn transfers himself to the stale heat and
dust of London. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) manner of coming and going between the two places
is one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) impenetrabilities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) walks into Chesney Wold as if it
were next door to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chambers and returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chambers as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
had never been out of Lincoln's Inn Fields. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) neither changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
dress before the journey nor talks of it afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) melted out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) turret-room this morning, just as now, in the late twilight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
melts into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own square.

<p/>Like a dingy London bird among the birds at roost in these pleasant
fields, where the sheep are all made into parchment, the goats into
wigs, and the pasture into chaff, the lawyer, smoke-dried and faded,
dwelling among mankind but not consorting with them, aged without
experience of genial youth, and so long used to make his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cramped nest
in holes and corners of human nature that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) has forgotten its
broader and better range, comes sauntering home. In the oven made by
the hot pavements and hot buildings, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) has baked himself dryer than
usual; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) thirsty mind his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) mellowed port-wine half a
century old.

<p/>The lamplighter is skipping up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) ladder on Mr.
Tulkinghorn's side of the Fields when that high-priest of noble
mysteries arrives at his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) own dull court-yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) ascends the
door-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) encounters, on
the top step, a bowing and propitiatory little man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that Snagsby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. I hope you are well, sir. I was just giving you up, sir,
and going home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye? What is it? What do you want with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hat at the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) deference towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) best customer, <div class="bookquote">``I was wishful to
say a word to you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>customer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you say it here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say it then.''  (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div>The lawyer turns, leans his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) arms on the iron railing
at the top of the steps, and looks at the lamplighter lighting the
court-yard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is relating,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby in a mysterious low voice, <div class="bookquote">``it is
relating--not to put too fine a point upon it--to the foreigner,
sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn eyes him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) with some surprise. <div class="bookquote">``What foreigner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The foreign female, sir. French, if I don't mistake? I am not
acquainted with that language myself, but I should judge from her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)
manners and appearance that she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) was French; anyways, certainly
foreign. Her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) that was upstairs, sir, when Mr. Bucket and me had the
honour of waiting upon you with the sweeping-boy that night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Yes, yes. Mademoiselle Hortense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby coughs his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of submission behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
hat. <div class="bookquote">``I am not acquainted myself with the names of foreigners in
general, but I have no doubt it WOULD be that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby appears
to have set out in this reply with some desperate design of repeating
the name, but on reflection coughs again to excuse himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what can you have to say, Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>demands Mr. Tulkinghorn,
<div class="bookquote">``about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>returns the stationer, shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) communication with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hat, <div class="bookquote">``it falls a little hard upon me. My domestic happiness is
very great--at least, it's as great as can be expected, I'm sure--but
my little woman is rather given to jealousy. Not to put too fine a
point upon it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is very much given to jealousy. And you see, a
foreign female of that genteel appearance coming into the shop, and
hovering--I should be the last to make use of a strong expression if
I could avoid it, but hovering, sir--in the court--you know it
is--now ain't it? I only put it to yourself, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby, having said this in a very plaintive manner, throws in a
cough of general application to fill up all the blanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Snagsby; <div class="bookquote">``I was sure you would feel it
yourself and would excuse the reasonableness of MY feelings when
coupled with the known excitableness of my little woman. You see, the
foreign female--which you mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) name just now, with quite a
native sound I am sure--caught up the word Snagsby that night, being
uncommon quick, and made inquiry, and got the direction and come at
dinner-time. Now Guster, our young woman, is timid and has fits, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), taking fright at the foreigner's looks--which are fierce--and at
a grinding manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has of speaking--which is calculated to
alarm a weak mind--gave way to it, instead of bearing up against it,
and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another, such
fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into, or come out of, in
any house but ours. Consequently there was by good fortune ample
occupation for my little woman, and only me to answer the shop. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) DID say that Mr. Tulkinghorn, being always denied to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
employer -LRB-which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of
viewing a clerk-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) would do herself the pleasure of continually
calling at my place until she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was let in here. Since then she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) has
been, as I began by saying, hovering, hovering, sir'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Snagsby
repeats the word with pathetic emphasis--<div class="bookquote">``in the court. The effects
of which movement it is impossible to calculate. I shouldn't wonder
if it might have already given rise to the painfullest mistakes even
in the neighbours' minds, not mentioning -LRB-if such a thing was
possible-RRB- my little woman. Whereas, goodness knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Snagsby, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``I never had an idea of a foreign female,
except as being formerly connected with a bunch of brooms and a baby,
or at the present time with a tambourine and earrings. I never had, I
do assure you, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn had listened gravely to this complaint and inquires
when the stationer has finished, <div class="bookquote">``And that's all, is it, Snagsby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why yes, sir, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, ending with a cough
that plainly adds, <div class="bookquote">``and it's enough too--for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what Mademoiselle Hortense may want or mean, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)
is mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) was, you know, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Snagsby pleads, <div class="bookquote">``it wouldn't be
a consolation to have some weapon or another in the form of a foreign
dagger planted in the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the other. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well! This shall be stopped. I am sorry
you have been inconvenienced. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) comes again, send her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Snagsby, with much bowing and short apologetic coughing, takes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) leave, lightened in heart. Mr. Tulkinghorn goes upstairs, saying
to himself, <div class="bookquote">``These women were created to give trouble the whole earth
over. The mistress not being enough to deal with, here's the maid
now! But I will be short with THIS jade at least!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) unlocks his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) door, gropes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) way into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) murky rooms,
lights his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) candles, and looks about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>). It is too dark to see much
of the Allegory overhead there, but that importunate Roman, who is
for ever toppling out of the clouds and pointing, is at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) old work
pretty distinctly. Not honouring him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) with much attention, Mr.
Tulkinghorn takes a small key from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) pocket, unlocks a drawer in
which there is another key, which unlocks a chest in which there is
another, and so comes to the cellar-key, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) prepares to
descend to the regions of old wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is going towards the door with
a candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hand when a knock comes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's this? Aye, aye, mistress, it's you, is it? You appear at a
good time. I have just been hearing of you. Now! What do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) stands the candle on the chimney-piece in the clerk's hall and
taps his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) dry cheek with the key as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) addresses these words of
welcome to Mademoiselle Hortense. That feline personage, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)
lips tightly shut and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) eyes looking out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) sideways, softly
closes the door before replying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had great deal of trouble to find you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HAVE you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been here very often, sir. It has always been said to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
is not at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is engage, he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is this and that, he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is not for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, and quite true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not true. Lies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div><p/>At times there is a suddenness in the manner of Mademoiselle Hortense
so like a bodily spring upon the subject of it that such subject
involuntarily starts and fails back. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn's case at
present, though Mademoiselle Hortense, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) eyes almost shut up
-LRB-but still looking out sideways-RRB-, is only smiling contemptuously and
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer, tapping the key hastily upon the
chimney-piece. <div class="bookquote">``If you have anything to say, say it, say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, you have not use me well. You have been mean and shabby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mean and shabby, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the lawyer</b></font>)</div>returns the lawyer, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) nose with the
key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. What is it that I tell you? You know you have. You have
attrapped me--catched me--to give you information; you have asked me
to show you the dress of mine my Lady must have wore that night, you
have prayed me to come in it here to meet that boy. Say! Is it not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div>Mademoiselle Hortense makes another spring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a vixen, a vixen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn seems to meditate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
looks distrustfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>), then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) replies, <div class="bookquote">``Well, wench, well. I
paid you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You paid me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) repeats with fierce disdain. <div class="bookquote">``Two sovereign! I
have not change them, I re-fuse them, I des-pise them, I throw them
from me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) literally does, taking them out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) bosom as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) speaks and flinging them with such violence on the floor that
they jerk up again into the light before they roll away into corners
and slowly settle down there after spinning vehemently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div>says Mademoiselle Hortense, darkening her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) large eyes again.
<div class="bookquote">``You have paid me? Eh, my God, oh yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn rubs his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head with the key while she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) entertains
herself with a sarcastic laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be rich, my fair friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) composedly observes, <div class="bookquote">``to throw
money about in that way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I AM rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) returns. <div class="bookquote">``I am very rich in hate. I hate my Lady, of
all my heart. You know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Know it? How should I know it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you have known it perfectly before you prayed me to give you
that information. Because you have known perfectly that I was
en-r-r-r-raged!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It appears impossible for mademoiselle to roll the
letter <div class="bookquote">``r''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>sufficiently in this word, notwithstanding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)
assists her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) energetic delivery by clenching both her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) hands and
setting all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I knew that, did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, examining the wards
of the key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, without doubt. I am not blind. You have made sure of me because
you knew that. You had reason! I det-est her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div>Mademoiselle folds her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>)
arms and throws this last remark at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) over one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Having said this, have you anything else to say, mademoiselle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not yet placed. Place me well. Find me a good condition! If you
cannot, or do not choose to do that, employ me to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), to
chase her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), to disgrace and to dishonour her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). I will help you well,
and with a good will. It is what YOU do. Do I not know that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You appear to know a good deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn retorts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I not? Is it that I am so weak as to believe, like a child, that
I come here in that dress to rec-eive that boy only to decide a
little bet, a wager? Eh, my God, oh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In this reply, down to the
word <div class="bookquote">``wager''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inclusive, mademoiselle has been ironically polite and
tender, then as suddenly dashed into the bitterest and most defiant
scorn, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) black eyes in one and the same moment very nearly
shut and staringly wide open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, let us see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chin with the
key and looking imperturbably at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how this matter stands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Let us see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>mademoiselle assents, with many angry and tight
nods of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You come here to make a remarkably modest demand, which you have
just stated, and it not being conceded, you will come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And again,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods. <div class="bookquote">``And
yet again. And yet again. And many times again. In effect, for ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not only here, but you will go to Mr. Snagsby's too, perhaps?
That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And again,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeats mademoiselle, cataleptic with determination.
<div class="bookquote">``And yet again. And yet again. And many times again. In effect, for
ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Now, Mademoiselle Hortense, let me recommend you to take
the candle and pick up that money of yours. I think you will find it
behind the clerk's partition in the corner yonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) merely throws a laugh over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) shoulder and stands her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) ground
with folded arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the poorer you; so much the richer I! Look, mistress, this
is the key of my wine-cellar. It is a large key, but the keys of
prisons are larger. In this city there are houses of correction
-LRB-where the treadmills are, for women-RRB-, the gates of which are very
strong and heavy, and no doubt the keys too. I am afraid a lady of
your spirit and activity would find it an inconvenience to have one
of those keys turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for any length of time. What do you
think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>mademoiselle replies without any action and in a clear,
obliging voice, <div class="bookquote">``that you are a miserable wretch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Tulkinghorn, quietly blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) nose. <div class="bookquote">``But I
don't ask what you think of myself; I ask what you think of the
prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. What does it matter to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it matters this much, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer, deliberately
putting away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) handkerchief and adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) frill; <div class="bookquote">``the law is so
despotic here that it interferes to prevent any of our good English
citizens from being troubled, even by a lady's visits against his (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
desire. And on his (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) complaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is so troubled, it takes hold
of the troublesome lady and shuts her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up in prison under hard
discipline. Turns the key upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), mistress.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>Illustrating with the
cellar-key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns mademoiselle in the same pleasant voice. <div class="bookquote">``That is
droll! But--my faith!--still what does it matter to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My fair friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, <div class="bookquote">``make another visit here, or
at Mr. Snagsby's, and you shall learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case you will send me to the prison, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It would be contradictory for one in mademoiselle's state of
agreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth, otherwise a tigerish
expansion thereabouts might look as if a very little more would make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a word, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to be
unpolite, but if you ever present yourself uninvited here--or
there--again, I will give you over to the police. Their gallantry is
great, but they carry troublesome people through the streets in an
ignominious manner, strapped down on a board, my good wench.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will prove you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispers mademoiselle, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) hand,
<div class="bookquote">``I will try if you dare to do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>pursues the lawyer without minding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I place you in

before you find yourself at liberty again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will prove you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeats mademoiselle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) former whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>proceeds the lawyer, still without minding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you had
better go. Think twice before you come here again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) answers, <div class="bookquote">``twice two hundred times!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were dismissed by your lady, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn
observes, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) out upon the staircase, <div class="bookquote">``as the most

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) goes down without answering or looking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) is
gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) goes down too, and returning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) cobweb-covered bottle,
devotes himself to a leisurely enjoyment of its contents, now and
then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) throws his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chair, catching sight of the
pertinacious Roman pointing from the ceiling.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>It matters little now how much I thought of my living mother who had
told me evermore to consider her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dead. I could not venture to
approach her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) or to communicate with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in writing, for my sense of
the peril in which her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life was passed was only to be equalled by my
fears of increasing it. Knowing that my mere existence as a living
creature was an unforeseen danger in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) way, I could not always
conquer that terror of myself which had seized me when I first knew
the secret. At no time did I dare to utter her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name. I felt as if I
did not even dare to hear it. If the conversation anywhere, when I
was present, took that direction, as it sometimes naturally did, I
tried not to hear: I mentally counted, repeated something that I
knew, or went out of the room. I am conscious now that I often did
these things when there can have been no danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being spoken
of, but I did them in the dread I had of hearing anything that might
lead to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) betrayal, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) betrayal through me.

<p/>It matters little now how often I recalled the tones of my mother's
voice, wondered whether I should ever hear it again as I so longed to
do, and thought how strange and desolate it was that it should be so
new to me. It matters little that I watched for every public mention
of my mother's name; that I passed and repassed the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house
in town, loving it, but afraid to look at it; that I once sat in the
theatre when my mother was there and saw me, and when we were so wide
asunder before the great company of all degrees that any link or
confidence between us seemed a dream. It is all, all over. My lot has
been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story
of goodness and generosity in others. I may well pass that little and
go on.

<p/>When we were settled at home again, Ada and I had many conversations
with my guardian of which Richard was the theme. My dear girl was
deeply grieved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) should do their kind cousin so much wrong, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so faithful to Richard that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not bear to blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
even for that. My guardian was assured of it, and never coupled his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
name with a word of reproof. <div class="bookquote">``Rick is mistaken, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would
say to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, well! We have all been mistaken over and over
again. We must trust to you and time to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We knew afterwards what we suspected then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) did not trust to
time until he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had often tried to open Richard's eyes. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had
written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), tried every gentle and
persuasive art his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) kindness could devise. Our poor devoted Richard
was deaf and blind to all. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) were wrong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would make amends
when the Chancery suit was over. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) were groping in the dark,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could not do better than do his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) utmost to clear away those
clouds in which so much was confused and obscured. Suspicion and
misunderstanding were the fault of the suit? Then let him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) work the
suit out and come through it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) right mind. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
unvarying reply. Jarndyce and Jarndyce had obtained such possession
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) whole nature that it was impossible to place any consideration
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) did not, with a distorted kind of reason, make a
new argument in favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) did. <div class="bookquote">``So that it is even
more mischievous,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian once to me, <div class="bookquote">``to remonstrate with
the poor dear fellow than to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I took one of these opportunities of mentioning my doubts of Mr.
Skimpole as a good adviser for Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Adviser!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, who would advise
with Skimpole?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Encourager would perhaps have been a better word,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Encourager!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian again. <div class="bookquote">``Who could be encouraged by
Skimpole?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Richard?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Such an unworldly, uncalculating, gossamer
creature is a relief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and an amusement. But as to advising or
encouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or
anything, it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as
Skimpole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, cousin John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, who had just joined us and now looked
over my shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``what made him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) such a child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What made him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) such a child?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>inquired my guardian, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head,
a little at a loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, cousin John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) slowly replied, roughening his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head more and more, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is
all sentiment, and--and susceptibility, and--and sensibility,
and--and imagination. And these qualities are not regulated in him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),
somehow. I suppose the people who admired him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) for them in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) youth
attached too much importance to them and too little to any training
that would have balanced and adjusted them, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) became what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
is. Hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, stopping short and looking at us
hopefully. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think, you two?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada, glancing at me, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) thought it was a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) should be an
expense to Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is, so it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``That must not
be. We must arrange that. I must prevent it. That will never do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And I said I thought it was to be regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had ever
introduced Richard to Mr. Vholes for a present of five pounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian with a passing shade of vexation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
face. <div class="bookquote">``But there you have the man. There you have the man! There is
nothing mercenary in that with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no idea of the value of
money. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) introduces Rick, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is good friends with Mr.
Vholes and borrows five pounds of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) means nothing by it and
thinks nothing of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) told you himself, I'll be bound, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>cried my guardian, quite triumphant. <div class="bookquote">``There you have the
man! If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had meant any harm by it or was conscious of any harm in
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't tell it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells it as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does it in mere
simplicity. But you shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own home, and then you'll
understand him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better. We must pay a visit to Harold Skimpole and
caution him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) on these points. Lord bless you, my dears, an infant, an
infant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>In pursuance of this plan, we went into London on an early day and
presented ourselves at Mr. Skimpole's door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) lived in a place called the Polygon, in Somers Town, where there
were at that time a number of poor Spanish refugees walking about in
cloaks, smoking little paper cigars. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was a better tenant
than one might have supposed, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) friend Somebody
always paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) rent at last, or whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) inaptitude for
business rendered it particularly difficult to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) out, I don't
know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had occupied the same house some years. It was in a
state of dilapidation quite equal to our expectation. Two or three of
the area railings were gone, the water-butt was broken, the knocker
was loose, the bell-handle had been pulled off a long time to judge
from the rusty state of the wire, and dirty footprints on the steps
were the only signs of its being inhabited.

<p/>A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the
rents in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gown and the cracks in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoes like an over-ripe berry
answered our knock by opening the door a very little way and stopping
up the gap with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) figure. As she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew Mr. Jarndyce -LRB-indeed Ada and
I both thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) evidently associated him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) with the receipt of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) wages-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) immediately relented and allowed us to pass in. The
lock of the door being in a disabled condition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) then applied
herself to securing it with the chain, which was not in good action
either, and said would we go upstairs?

<p/>We went upstairs to the first floor, still seeing no other furniture
than the dirty footprints. Mr. Jarndyce without further ceremony
entered a room there, and we followed. It was dingy enough and not at
all clean, but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury, with a
large footstool, a sofa, and plenty of cushions, an easy-chair, and
plenty of pillows, a piano, books, drawing materials, music,
newspapers, and a few sketches and pictures. A broken pane of glass
in one of the dirty windows was papered and wafered over, but there
was a little plate of hothouse nectarines on the table, and there was
another of grapes, and another of sponge-cakes, and there was a
bottle of light wine. Mr. Skimpole himself reclined upon the sofa in
a dressing-gown, drinking some fragrant coffee from an old china
cup--it was then about mid-day--and looking at a collection of
wallflowers in the balcony.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was not in the least disconcerted by our appearance, but rose and
received us in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) usual airy manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am, you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said when we were seated, not without some
little difficulty, the greater part of the chairs being broken. <div class="bookquote">``Here
I am! This is my frugal breakfast. Some men want legs of beef and
mutton for breakfast; I don't. Give me my peach, my cup of coffee,
and my claret; I am content. I don't want them for themselves, but
they remind me of the sun. There's nothing solar about legs of beef
and mutton. Mere animal satisfaction!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is our friend's consulting-room -LRB-or would be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ever

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) bright face about, <div class="bookquote">``this is the

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) handed us the grapes, repeating in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) radiant way, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sings!

an ambitious note, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``A present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) answered. ``No! Some amiable gardener sells them. His (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) man
wanted to know, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) brought them last evening, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) should
wait for the money. ``Really, my friend,'' I said, ``I think not--if
your time is of any value to you.<div class="bookquote">'' I suppose it was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) went
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian looked at us with a smile, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) asked us, <div class="bookquote">``Is it
possible to be worldly with this baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, gaily taking a little claret in a
tumbler, <div class="bookquote">``that will ever be remembered here. We shall call it Saint
Clare and Saint Summerson day. You must see my daughters. I have a
blue-eyed daughter who is my Beauty daughter, I have a Sentiment
daughter, and I have a Comedy daughter. You must see them all.
They'll be enchanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was going to summon them when my guardian interposed and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
to pause a moment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) wished to say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) first. <div class="bookquote">``My dear
Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) cheerfully replied, going back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) sofa, ``as many
moments as you please. Time is no object here. We never know what
o'clock it is, and we never care. Not the way to get on in life,
you'll tell me? Certainly. But we DON<div class="bookquote">``T get on in life. We don't
pretend to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian looked at us again, plainly saying, <div class="bookquote">``You hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Harold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``the word I have to say relates to Rick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The dearest friend I have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole cordially. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ought not to be my dearest friend, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not on terms
with you. But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is, I can't help it; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is full of youthful poetry,
and I love him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). If you don't like it, I can't help it. I love him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The engaging frankness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) made this declaration really had
a disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian, if not, for
the moment, Ada too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are welcome to love him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as much as you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>returned Mr.
Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``but we must save his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket, Harold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket? Now you are coming to what I
don't understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Taking a little more claret and dipping one of the
cakes in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head and smiled at Ada and me with an
ingenuous foreboding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) never could be made to understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you go with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) here or there,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian plainly, <div class="bookquote">``you
must not let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pay for both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole, his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) genial face irradiated
by the comicality of this idea, <div class="bookquote">``what am I to do? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) takes me
anywhere, I must go. And how can I pay? I never have any money. If I
had any money, I don't know anything about it. Suppose I say to a
man, how much? Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence? I know
nothing about seven and sixpence. It is impossible for me to pursue
the subject with any consideration for the man. I don't go about
asking busy people what seven and sixpence is in Moorish--which I
don't understand. Why should I go about asking them what seven and
sixpence is in Money--which I don't understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, by no means displeased with this artless
reply, <div class="bookquote">``if you come to any kind of journeying with Rick, you must
borrow the money of me -LRB-never breathing the least allusion to that
circumstance-RRB-, and leave the calculation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``I will do anything to
give you pleasure, but it seems an idle form--a superstition.
Besides, I give you my word, Miss Clare and my dear Miss Summerson, I
thought Mr. Carstone was immensely rich. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) had only to
make over something, or to sign a bond, or a draft, or a cheque, or a
bill, or to put something on a file somewhere, to bring down a shower
of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed it is not so, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>said Ada. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) is poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) bright smile. ``You
surprise me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And not being the richer for trusting in a rotten reed,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my
guardian, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) hand emphatically on the sleeve of Mr.
Skimpole's dressing-gown, <div class="bookquote">``be you very careful not to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>)
in that reliance, Harold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``and my dear Miss
Simmerson, and my dear Miss Clare, how can I do that? It's business,
and I don't know business. It is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) who encourages me. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) emerges
from great feats of business, presents the brightest prospects before
me as their result, and calls upon me to admire them. I do admire
them--as bright prospects. But I know no more about them, and I tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>The helpless kind of candour with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) presented this before us,
the light-hearted manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was amused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) innocence, the
fantastic way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) took himself under his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own protection and
argued about that curious person, combined with the delightful ease
of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said exactly to make out my guardian's case. The
more I saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), the more unlikely it seemed to me, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was
present, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) could design, conceal, or influence anything; and
yet the less likely that appeared when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was not present, and the
less agreeable it was to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) having anything to do with any
one for whom I cared.

<p/>Hearing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) examination -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) called it-RRB- was now over, Mr.
Skimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) daughters
-LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) sons had run away at various times-RRB-, leaving my guardian quite
delighted by the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had vindicated his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) childish
character. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) soon came back, bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) the three young
ladies and Mrs. Skimpole, who had once been a beauty but was now a
delicate high-nosed invalid suffering under a complication of
disorders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``is my Beauty daughter, Arethusa--plays
and sings odds and ends like her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father. This is my Sentiment
daughter, Laura--plays a little but don't sing. This is my Comedy
daughter, Kitty--sings a little but don't play. We all draw a little
and compose a little, and none of us have any idea of time or money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Skimpole sighed, I thought, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would have been glad to
strike out this item in the family attainments. I also thought that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) rather impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) sigh upon my guardian and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) took
every opportunity of throwing in another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) sprightly eyes from
one to the other of us, <div class="bookquote">``and it is whimsically interesting to trace
peculiarities in families. In this family we are all children, and I
am the youngest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>The daughters, who appeared to be very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), were amused by
this droll fact, particularly the Comedy daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dears, it is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``is it not? So it is, and
so it must be, because like the dogs in the hymn, `it is our nature
to.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>Now, here is Miss Summerson with a fine administrative capacity
and a knowledge of details perfectly surprising. It will sound very
strange in Miss Summerson's ears, I dare say, that we know nothing
about chops in this house. But we don't, not the least. We can't cook
anything whatever. A needle and thread we don't know how to use. We
admire the people who possess the practical wisdom we want, but we
don't quarrel with them. Then why should they quarrel with us? Live
and let live, we say to them. Live upon your practical wisdom, and
let us live upon you!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laughed, but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have sympathy, my roses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``sympathy for
everything. Have we not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughters</b></font>)</div>cried the three daughters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In fact, that is our family department,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``in this
hurly-burly of life. We are capable of looking on and of being
interested, and we DO look on, and we ARE interested. What more can
we do? Here is my Beauty daughter, married these three years. Now I
dare say her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marrying another child, and having two more, was all
wrong in point of political economy, but it was very agreeable. We
had our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social
ideas. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) young husband home one day, and they and their
young fledglings have their nest upstairs. I dare say at some time or
other Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have
THEIR nests upstairs too. So we get on, we don't know how, but
somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children, and I
could not help pitying both her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) and them. It was evident that the
three daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little
haphazard instruction as qualified them to be their father's
playthings in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) idlest hours. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pictorial tastes were consulted,
I observed, in their respective styles of wearing their hair, the
Beauty daughter being in the classic manner, the Sentiment daughter
luxuriant and flowing, and the Comedy daughter in the arch style,
with a good deal of sprightly forehead, and vivacious little curls
dotted about the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eyes. They were dressed to
correspond, though in a most untidy and negligent way.

<p/>Ada and I conversed with these young ladies and found them
wonderfully like their father. In the meanwhile Mr. Jarndyce -LRB-who had
been rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) head to a great extent, and hinted at a change in
the wind-RRB- talked with Mrs. Skimpole in a corner, where we could not
help hearing the chink of money. Mr. Skimpole had previously
volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for
the purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My roses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) came back, <div class="bookquote">``take care of mama. She (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) is
poorly to-day. By going home with Mr. Jarndyce for a day or two, I
shall hear the larks sing and preserve my amiability. It has been
tried, you know, and would be tried again if I remained at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That bad man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Comedy daughter</b></font>)</div>said the Comedy daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the very time when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew papa was lying ill by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wallflowers,
looking at the blue sky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura</b></font>)</div>Laura complained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when the smell of hay was in the air!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arethusa</b></font>)</div>said Arethusa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It showed a want of poetry in the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>Mr. Skimpole assented, but
with perfect good humour. <div class="bookquote">``It was coarse. There was an absence of the
finer touches of humanity in it! My daughters have taken great
offence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) explained to us, <div class="bookquote">``at an honest man--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not honest, papa. Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>they all three protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At a rough kind of fellow--a sort of human hedgehog rolled up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Skimpole, ``who is a baker in this neighbourhood and from whom we
borrowed a couple of arm-chairs. We wanted a couple of arm-chairs,
and we hadn't got them, and therefore of course we looked to a man
who HAD got them, to lend them. Well! This morose person lent them,
and we wore them out. When they were worn out, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted them back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had them back. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was contented, you will say. Not at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
objected to their being worn. I reasoned with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and pointed out
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistake. I said, ``Can you, at your time of life, be so
headstrong, my friend, as to persist that an arm-chair is a thing to
put upon a shelf and look at? That it is an object to contemplate, to
survey from a distance, to consider from a point of sight? Don't you
KNOW that these arm-chairs were borrowed to be sat upon?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was
unreasonable and unpersuadable and used intemperate language. Being
as patient as I am at this minute, I addressed another appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>).
I said, ``Now, my good man, however our business capacities may vary,
we are all children of one great mother, Nature. On this blooming
summer morning here you see me' -LRB-I was on the sofa-RRB- `with flowers
before me, fruit upon the table, the cloudless sky above me, the air
full of fragrance, contemplating Nature. I entreat you, by our common
brotherhood, not to interpose between me and a subject so sublime,
the absurd figure of an angry baker!<div class="bookquote">'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>an baker</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole,
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) laughing eyes in playful astonishment; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) did interpose
that ridiculous figure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) does, and he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) will again. And therefore
I am very glad to get out of his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) way and to go home with my friend
Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the
daughters remained behind to encounter the baker, but this was so old
a story to all of them that it had become a matter of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) took
leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) family with a tenderness as airy and graceful as any
other aspect in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) showed himself and rode away with us in
perfect harmony of mind. We had an opportunity of seeing through some
open doors, as we went downstairs, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own apartment was a
palace to the rest of the house.

<p/>I could have no anticipation, and I had none, that something very
startling to me at the moment, and ever memorable to me in what
ensued from it, was to happen before this day was out. Our guest was
in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to
him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) and wonder at him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>); nor was I alone in this, for Ada yielded to
the same fascination. As to my guardian, the wind, which had
threatened to become fixed in the east when we left Somers Town,
veered completely round before we were a couple of miles from it.

<p/>Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters, Mr.
Skimpole had a child's enjoyment of change and bright weather. In no
way wearied by his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) sallies on the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was in the drawing-room
before any of us; and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) at the piano while I was yet
looking after my housekeeping, singing refrains of barcaroles and
drinking songs, Italian and German, by the score.

<p/>We were all assembled shortly before dinner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) was still at the
piano idly picking out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) luxurious way little strains of music,
and talking between whiles of finishing some sketches of the ruined
old Verulam wall to-morrow, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had begun a year or two ago and
had got tired of, when a card was brought in and my guardian read
aloud in a surprised voice, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>The visitor was in the room while it was yet turning round with me
and before I had the power to stir. If I had had it, I should have
hurried away. I had not even the presence of mind, in my giddiness,
to retire to Ada in the window, or to see the window, or to know
where it was. I heard my name and found that my guardian was
presenting me before I could move to a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray be seated, Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sir Leicester in reply as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) bowed and seated
himself, <div class="bookquote">``I do myself the honour of calling here--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do ME the honour, Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you--of calling here on my road from Lincolnshire to express
my regret that any cause of complaint, however strong, that I may
have against a gentleman who--who is known to you and has been your
host, and to whom therefore I will make no farther reference, should
have prevented you, still more ladies under your escort and charge,
from seeing whatever little there may be to gratify a polite and
refined taste at my house, Chesney Wold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are exceedingly obliging, Sir Leicester, and on behalf of those
ladies -LRB-who are present-RRB- and for myself, I thank you very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that the gentleman to whom, for the
reasons I have mentioned, I refrain from making further allusion--it
is possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that that gentleman may have done me the
honour so far to misapprehend my character as to induce you to
believe that you would not have been received by my local
establishment in Lincolnshire with that urbanity, that courtesy,
which its members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen
who present themselves at that house. I merely beg to observe, sir,
that the fact is the reverse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian delicately dismissed this remark without making any
verbal answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has given me pain, Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester weightily
proceeded. <div class="bookquote">``I assure you, sir, it has given--me--pain--to learn from
the housekeeper at Chesney Wold that a gentleman who was in your
company in that part of the county, and who would appear to possess a
cultivated taste for the fine arts, was likewise deterred by some
such cause from examining the family pictures with that leisure, that
attention, that care, which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have desired to bestow upon them
and which some of them might possibly have repaid.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) produced
a card and read, with much gravity and a little trouble, through his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
eye-glass, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hirrold--Herald--Harold--Skampling--Skumpling--I beg
your pardon--Skimpole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Mr. Harold Skimpole,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, evidently surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``I am happy to meet Mr. Skimpole and
to have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets. I hope,
sir, that when you again find yourself in my part of the county, you
will be under no similar sense of restraint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very obliging, Sir Leicester Dedlock. So encouraged, I shall
certainly give myself the pleasure and advantage of another visit to
your beautiful house. The owners of such places as Chesney Wold,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) usual happy and easy air, <div class="bookquote">``are public
benefactors. They are good enough to maintain a number of delightful
objects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men; and not to
reap all the admiration and pleasure that they yield is to be
ungrateful to our benefactors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this sentiment highly. <div class="bookquote">``An artist,
sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``A perfectly idle man. A mere amateur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this even more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) might
have the good fortune to be at Chesney Wold when Mr. Skimpole next
came down into Lincolnshire. Mr. Skimpole professed himself much
flattered and honoured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Skimpole mentioned,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>pursued Sir Leicester, addressing himself
again to my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``mentioned to the housekeeper, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) may
have observed, is an old and attached retainer of the family--''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``That is, when I walked through the house the other day, on the
occasion of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare,''
 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>Mr. Skimpole airily explained to us.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--That the friend with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) had formerly been staying there was
Mr. Jarndyce.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester bowed to the bearer of that name. <div class="bookquote">``And
hence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have professed
my regret. That this should have occurred to any gentleman, Mr.
Jarndyce, but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock,
and indeed claiming some distant connexion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), and for whom -LRB-as
I learn from my Lady herself-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) entertains a high respect, does, I
assure you, give--me--pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray say no more about it, Sir Leicester,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``I
am very sensible, as I am sure we all are, of your consideration.
Indeed the mistake was mine, and I ought to apologize for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had not once looked up. I had not seen the visitor and had not even
appeared to myself to hear the conversation. It surprises me to find
that I can recall it, for it seemed to make no impression on me as it
passed. I heard them speaking, but my mind was so confused and my
instinctive avoidance of this gentleman made his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) presence so
distressing to me that I thought I understood nothing, through the
rushing in my head and the beating of my heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mentioned the subject to Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sir Leicester,
rising, <div class="bookquote">``and my Lady informed me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had had the pleasure of
exchanging a few words with Mr. Jarndyce and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) wards on the
occasion of an accidental meeting during their sojourn in the
vicinity. Permit me, Mr. Jarndyce, to repeat to yourself, and to
these ladies, the assurance I have already tendered to Mr. Skimpole.
Circumstances undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me
any gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favoured my house
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) presence, but those circumstances are confined to that
gentleman himself and do not extend beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know my old opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, lightly
appealing to us. <div class="bookquote">``An amiable bull who is determined to make every
colour scarlet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester Dedlock coughed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) could not possibly hear
another word in reference to such an individual and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) leave
with great ceremony and politeness. I got to my own room with all
possible speed and remained there until I had recovered my
self-command. It had been very much disturbed, but I was thankful to
find when I went downstairs again that they only rallied me for
having been shy and mute before the great Lincolnshire baronet.

<p/>By that time I had made up my mind that the period was come when I
must tell my guardian what I knew. The possibility of my being
brought into contact with my mother, of my being taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house,
even of Mr. Skimpole's, however distantly associated with me,
receiving kindnesses and obligations from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, was so painful
that I felt I could no longer guide myself without his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) assistance.

<p/>When we had retired for the night, and Ada and I had had our usual
talk in our pretty room, I went out at my door again and sought my
guardian among his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) books. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) always read at that hour, and as
I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
reading-lamp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I come in, guardian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, little woman. What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is the matter. I thought I would like to take this quiet
time of saying a word to you about myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put a chair for me, shut his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) book, and put it by, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
kind attentive face towards me. I could not help observing that it
wore that curious expression I had observed in it once before--on
that night when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in no trouble which I could
readily understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What concerns you, my dear Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``concerns us all. You
cannot be more ready to speak than I am to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, guardian. But I have such need of your advice and
support. Oh! You don't know how much need I have to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked unprepared for my being so earnest, and even a little
alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or how anxious I have been to speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``ever since the
visitor was here to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The visitor, my dear! Sir Leicester Dedlock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) folded his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms and sat looking at me with an air of the
profoundest astonishment, awaiting what I should say next. I did not
know how to prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), breaking into a smile, <div class="bookquote">``our visitor and you
are the two last persons on earth I should have thought of connecting
together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, guardian, I know it. And I too, but a little while ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The smile passed from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) became graver than before. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
crossed to the door to see that it was shut -LRB-but I had seen to that-RRB-
and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seat before me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``do you remember, when we were overtaken by the
thunder-storm, Lady Dedlock's speaking to you of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. Of course I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And reminding you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sister had differed, had gone
their several ways?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did they separate, guardian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face quite altered as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at me. <div class="bookquote">``My child, what questions
are these! I never knew. No one but themselves ever did know, I
believe. Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and
proud women were! You have seen Lady Dedlock. If you had ever seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sister, you would know her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) to have been as resolute and haughty
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, guardian, I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) many and many a time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) paused a little, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Then, Esther, when you spoke to
me long ago of Boythorn, and when I told you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was all but
married once, and that the lady did not die, but died to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), and
that that time had had its influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) later life--did you know
it all, and know who the lady was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, fearful of the light that dimly broke
upon me. <div class="bookquote">``Nor do I know yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock's sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could scarcely ask him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``why, guardian, pray tell me why
were THEY parted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) act, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) kept its motives in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) inflexible heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
afterwards did conjecture -LRB-but it was mere conjecture-RRB- that some
injury which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) haughty spirit had received in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) cause of quarrel
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sister had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) beyond all reason, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
that from the date of that letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) died to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)--as in literal
truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did--and that the resolution was exacted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) proud temper and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) strained sense of honour, which
were both her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) nature too. In consideration for those master points in
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and even in consideration for them in herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) made the
sacrifice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said, and would live in it and die in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did
both, I fear; certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) from
that hour. Nor did any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, guardian, what have I done!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, giving way to my grief;
<div class="bookquote">``what sorrow have I innocently caused!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You caused, Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, guardian. Innocently, but most surely. That secluded sister is
my first remembrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cried, starting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, guardian, yes! And HER sister is my mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I would have told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) all my mother's letter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not hear
it then. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke so tenderly and wisely to me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put so plainly
before me all I had myself imperfectly thought and hoped in my better
state of mind, that, penetrated as I had been with fervent gratitude
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) through so many years, I believed I had never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
so dearly, never thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in my heart so fully, as I did that
night. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had taken me to my room and kissed me at the door,
and when at last I lay down to sleep, my thought was how could I ever
be busy enough, how could I ever be good enough, how in my little way
could I ever hope to be forgetful enough of myself, devoted enough to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and useful enough to others, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) how I blessed and
honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV

<p/>The Letter and the Answer


<p/>My guardian called me into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) room next morning, and then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
what had been left untold on the previous night. There was nothing to
be done, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, but to keep the secret and to avoid another such
encounter as that of yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) understood my feeling and entirely
shared it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) charged himself even with restraining Mr. Skimpole from
improving his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opportunity. One person whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) need not name to me, it
was not now possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to advise or help. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wished it were,
but no such thing could be. If her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mistrust of the lawyer whom she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had mentioned were well-founded, which he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) scarcely doubted, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
dreaded discovery. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) knew something of him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), both by sight and by
reputation, and it was certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was a dangerous man. Whatever
happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) repeatedly impressed upon me with anxious affection and
kindness, I was as innocent of as himself and as unable to influence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor do I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that any doubts tend towards you, my
dear. Much suspicion may exist without that connexion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the lawyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. ``But two other persons have come into
my mind since I have been anxious. Then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) all about Mr.
Guppy, who I feared might have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) vague surmises when I little
understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) meaning, but in whose silence after our last interview
I expressed perfect confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``Then we may dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) for the present.
Who is the other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I called to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) recollection the French maid and the eager offer of
herself she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had made to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) returned thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``That is a more alarming person than
the clerk. But after all, my dear, it was but seeking for a new
service. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had seen you and Ada a little while before, and it was
natural that you should come into her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) merely proposed
herself for your maid, you know. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) did nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) manner was strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) manner was strange when she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) shoes off and
showed that cool relish for a walk that might have ended in her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)
death-bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``It would be useless self-distress and
torment to reckon up such chances and possibilities. There are very
few harmless circumstances that would not seem full of perilous
meaning, so considered. Be hopeful, little woman. You can be nothing
better than yourself; be that, through this knowledge, as you were
before you had it. It is the best you can do for everybody's sake. I,
sharing the secret with you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And lightening it, guardian, so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--will be attentive to what passes in that family, so far as I can
observe it from my distance. And if the time should come when I can
stretch out a hand to render the least service to one whom it is
better not to name even here, I will not fail to do it for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dear
daughter's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) with my whole heart. What could I ever do but thank
him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)! I was going out at the door when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) asked me to stay a moment.
Quickly turning round, I saw that same expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) face again;
and all at once, I don't know how, it flashed upon me as a new and
far-off possibility that I understood it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``I have long had something in my
thoughts that I have wished to say to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had some difficulty in approaching it, and I still have. I
should wish it to be so deliberately said, and so deliberately
considered. Would you object to my writing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear guardian, how could I object to your writing anything for ME to
read?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then see, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cheery smile, <div class="bookquote">``am I at this
moment quite as plain and easy--do I seem as open, as honest and
old-fashioned--as I am at any time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I answered in all earnestness, <div class="bookquote">``Quite.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>With the strictest truth, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) momentary hesitation was gone -LRB-it had not lasted a minute-RRB-, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) fine, sensible, cordial, sterling manner was restored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I look as if I suppressed anything, meant anything but what I
said, had any reservation at all, no matter what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
bright clear eyes on mine.

<p/>I answered, most assuredly he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) did not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you fully trust me, and thoroughly rely on what I profess,
Esther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most thoroughly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I with my whole heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``give me your hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), holding me lightly with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) arm, and looking down
into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of
manner--the old protecting manner which had made that house my home
in a moment--said, <div class="bookquote">``You have wrought changes in me, little woman,
since the winter day in the stage-coach. First and last you have done
me a world of good since that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, guardian, what have you done for me since that time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that is not to be remembered now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It never can be forgotten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) with a gentle seriousness, <div class="bookquote">``it is to be
forgotten now, to be forgotten for a while. You are only to remember
now that nothing can change me as you know me. Can you feel quite
assured of that, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can, and I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``That's everything. But I must not take
that at a word. I will not write this something in my thoughts until
you have quite resolved within yourself that nothing can change me as
you know me. If you doubt that in the least degree, I will never
write it. If you are sure of that, on good consideration, send
Charley to me this night week--`for the letter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But if you are not
quite certain, never send. Mind, I trust to your truth, in this thing
as in everything. If you are not quite certain on that one point,
never send!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I am already certain, I can no more be changed
in that conviction than you can be changed towards me. I shall send
Charley for the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) shook my hand and said no more. Nor was any more said in reference
to this conversation, either by him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) or me, through the whole week.
When the appointed night came, I said to Charley as soon as I was
alone, <div class="bookquote">``Go and knock at Mr. Jarndyce's door, Charley, and say you
have come from me--`for the letter.'''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Charley went up the stairs, and
down the stairs, and along the passages--the zig-zag way about the
old-fashioned house seemed very long in my listening ears that
night--and so came back, along the passages, and down the stairs, and
up the stairs, and brought the letter. <div class="bookquote">``Lay it on the table,
Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I. So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed,
and I sat looking at it without taking it up, thinking of many
things.

<p/>I began with my overshadowed childhood, and passed through those
timid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead, with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resolute
face so cold and set, and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael
than if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at. I
passed to the altered days when I was so blest as to find friends in
all around me, and to be beloved. I came to the time when I first saw
my dear girl and was received into that sisterly affection which was
the grace and beauty of my life. I recalled the first bright gleam of
welcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our expectant
faces on that cold bright night, and which had never paled. I lived
my happy life there over again, I went through my illness and
recovery, I thought of myself so altered and of those around me so
unchanged; and all this happiness shone like a light from one central
figure, represented before me by the letter on the table.

<p/>I opened it and read it. It was so impressive in its love for me, and
in the unselfish caution it gave me, and the consideration it showed
for me in every word, that my eyes were too often blinded to read
much at a time. But I read it through three times before I laid it
down. I had thought beforehand that I knew its purport, and I did. It
asked me, would I be the mistress of Bleak House.

<p/>It was not a love letter, though it expressed so much love, but was
written just as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would at any time have spoken to me. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
face, and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) voice, and felt the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) kind
protecting manner in every line. It addressed me as if our places
were reversed, as if all the good deeds had been mine and all the
feelings they had awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). It dwelt on my being young, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
past the prime of life; on his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) having attained a ripe age, while I
was a child; on his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) writing to me with a silvered head, and knowing
all this so well as to set it in full before me for mature
deliberation. It told me that I would gain nothing by such a marriage
and lose nothing by rejecting it, for no new relation could enhance
the tenderness in which he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) held me, and whatever my decision was, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
was certain it would be right. But he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had considered this step anew
since our late confidence and had decided on taking it, if it only
served to show me through one poor instance that the whole world
would readily unite to falsify the stern prediction of my childhood.
I was the last to know what happiness I could bestow upon him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), but of
that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said no more, for I was always to remember that I owed him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
nothing and that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was my debtor, and for very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had often
thought of our future, and foreseeing that the time must come, and
fearing that it might come soon, when Ada -LRB-now very nearly of age-RRB-
would leave us, and when our present mode of life must be broken up,
had become accustomed to reflect on this proposal. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) made it.
If I felt that I could ever give him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) the best right he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could have to
be my protector, and if I felt that I could happily and justly become
the dear companion of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) remaining life, superior to all lighter
chances and changes than death, even then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could not have me bind
myself irrevocably while this letter was yet so new to me, but even
then I must have ample time for reconsideration. In that case, or in
the opposite case, let him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) be unchanged in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) old relation, in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
old manner, in the old name by which I called him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). And as to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
bright Dame Durden and little housekeeper, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would ever be the
same, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) knew.

<p/>This was the substance of the letter, written throughout with a
justice and a dignity as if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) were indeed my responsible guardian
impartially representing the proposal of a friend against whom in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
integrity he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stated the full case.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
had this same proceeding in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thoughts and had refrained from it.
That when my old face was gone from me, and I had no attractions, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
could love me just as well as in my fairer days. That the discovery
of my birth gave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) no shock. That his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) generosity rose above my
disfigurement and my inheritance of shame. That the more I stood in
need of such fidelity, the more firmly I might trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to the
last.

<p/>But I knew it, I knew it well now. It came upon me as the close of
the benignant history I had been pursuing, and I felt that I had but
one thing to do. To devote my life to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) happiness was to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
poorly, and what had I wished for the other night but some new means
of thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?

<p/>Still I cried very much, not only in the fullness of my heart after
reading the letter, not only in the strangeness of the prospect--for
it was strange though I had expected the contents--but as if
something for which there was no name or distinct idea were
indefinitely lost to me. I was very happy, very thankful, very
hopeful; but I cried very much.

<p/>By and by I went to my old glass. My eyes were red and swollen, and I
said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Esther, Esther, can that be you!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am afraid the face in
the glass was going to cry again at this reproach, but I held up my
finger at it, and it stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is more like the composed look you comforted me with, my dear,
when you showed me such a change!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, beginning to let down my
hair. <div class="bookquote">``When you are mistress of Bleak House, you are to be as
cheerful as a bird. In fact, you are always to be cheerful; so let us
begin for once and for all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went on with my hair now, quite comfortably. I sobbed a little
still, but that was because I had been crying, not because I was
crying then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so Esther, my dear, you are happy for life. Happy with your best
friends, happy in your old home, happy in the power of doing a great
deal of good, and happy in the undeserved love of the best of men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought, all at once, if my guardian had married some one else, how
should I have felt, and what should I have done! That would have been
a change indeed. It presented my life in such a new and blank form
that I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid
them down in their basket again.

<p/>Then I went on to think, as I dressed my hair before the glass, how
often had I considered within myself that the deep traces of my
illness and the circumstances of my birth were only new reasons why I
should be busy, busy, busy--useful, amiable, serviceable, in all
honest, unpretending ways. This was a good time, to be sure, to sit
down morbidly and cry! As to its seeming at all strange to me at
first -LRB-if that were any excuse for crying, which it was not-RRB- that I
was one day to be the mistress of Bleak House, why should it seem
strange? Other people had thought of such things, if I had not.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember, my plain dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked myself, looking at the
glass, <div class="bookquote">``what Mrs. Woodcourt said before those scars were there about
your marrying--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps the name brought them to my remembrance. The dried remains of
the flowers. It would be better not to keep them now. They had only
been preserved in memory of something wholly past and gone, but it
would be better not to keep them now.

<p/>They were in a book, and it happened to be in the next room--our
sitting-room, dividing Ada's chamber from mine. I took a candle and
went softly in to fetch it from its shelf. After I had it in my hand,
I saw my beautiful darling, through the open door, lying asleep, and
I stole in to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>).

<p/>It was weak in me, I know, and I could have no reason for crying; but
I dropped a tear upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) dear face, and another, and another. Weaker
than that, I took the withered flowers out and put them for a moment
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lips. I thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) love for Richard, though, indeed,
the flowers had nothing to do with that. Then I took them into my own
room and burned them at the candle, and they were dust in an instant.

<p/>On entering the breakfast-room next morning, I found my guardian just
as usual, quite as frank, as open, and free. There being not the
least constraint in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) manner, there was none -LRB-or I think there was
none-RRB- in mine. I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) several times in the course of the
morning, in and out, when there was no one there, and I thought it
not unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) might speak to me about the letter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) did
not say a word.

<p/>So, on the next morning, and the next, and for at least a week, over
which time Mr. Skimpole prolonged his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) stay. I expected, every day,
that my guardian might speak to me about the letter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) never
did.

<p/>I thought then, growing uneasy, that I ought to write an answer. I
tried over and over again in my own room at night, but I could not
write an answer that at all began like a good answer, so I thought
each night I would wait one more day. And I waited seven more days,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) never said a word.

<p/>At last, Mr. Skimpole having departed, we three were one afternoon
going out for a ride; and I, being dressed before Ada and going down,
came upon my guardian, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) back towards me, standing at the
drawing-room window looking out.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) turned on my coming in and said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``Aye, it's you, little
woman, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and looked out again.

<p/>I had made up my mind to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) now. In short, I had come down
on purpose. <div class="bookquote">``Guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, rather hesitating and trembling,
<div class="bookquote">``when would you like to have the answer to the letter Charley came
for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When it's ready, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Charley to bring it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) asked pleasantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I have brought it myself, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned.

<p/>I put my two arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) neck and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said was this
the mistress of Bleak House, and I said yes; and it made no
difference presently, and we all went out together, and I said
nothing to my precious pet about it.




<p/>CHAPTER XLV

<p/>In Trust


<p/>One morning when I had done jingling about with my baskets of keys,
as my beauty and I were walking round and round the garden I happened
to turn my eyes towards the house and saw a long thin shadow going in
which looked like Mr. Vholes. Ada had been telling me only that
morning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hopes that Richard might exhaust his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) ardour in the
Chancery suit by being so very earnest in it; and therefore, not to
damp my dear girl's spirits, I said nothing about Mr. Vholes's
shadow.

<p/>Presently came Charley, lightly winding among the bushes and tripping
along the paths, as rosy and pretty as one of Flora's attendants
instead of my maid, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you please, miss, would you step
and speak to Mr. Jarndyce!''

 (<font color='red'><b>maid</b></font>)</div><p/>It was one of Charley's peculiarities that whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was charged
with a message she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) always began to deliver it as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) beheld,
at any distance, the person for whom it was intended. Therefore I saw
Charley asking me in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) usual form of words to <div class="bookquote">``step and speak''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>to
Mr. Jarndyce long before I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). And when I did hear her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
had said it so often that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was out of breath.

<p/>I told Ada I would make haste back and inquired of Charley as we went
in whether there was not a gentleman with Mr. Jarndyce. To which
Charley, whose grammar, I confess to my shame, never did any credit
to my educational powers, replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) as come down in
the country with Mr. Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>A more complete contrast than my guardian and Mr. Vholes I suppose
there could not be. I found them looking at one another across a
table, the one so open and the other so close, the one so broad and
upright and the other so narrow and stooping, the one giving out what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) had to say in such a rich ringing voice and the other keeping it
in in such a cold-blooded, gasping, fish-like manner that I thought I
never had seen two people so unmatched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Mr. Vholes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. Not with the
greatest urbanity, I must say.

<p/>Mr. Vholes rose, gloved and buttoned up as usual, and seated himself
again, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) had seated himself beside Richard in the gig. Not
having Richard to look at, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) looked straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vholes,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) black figure as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) were
a bird of ill omen, <div class="bookquote">``has brought an ugly report of our most
unfortunate Rick.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Laying a marked emphasis on <div class="bookquote">``most unfortunate''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>as
if the words were rather descriptive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) connexion with Mr.
Vholes.

<p/>I sat down between them; Mr. Vholes remained immovable, except that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) secretly picked at one of the red pimples on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) yellow face with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) black glove.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And as Rick and you are happily good friends, I should like to
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``what you think, my dear. Would you be so
good as to--as to speak up, Mr. Vholes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>Doing anything but that, Mr. Vholes observed, ``I have been saying
that I have reason to know, Miss Summerson, as Mr. C.``s professional
adviser, that Mr. C.``s circumstances are at the present moment in an
embarrassed state. Not so much in point of amount as owing to the
peculiar and pressing nature of liabilities Mr. C. has incurred and
the means he (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) has of liquidating or meeting the same. I have staved
off many little matters for Mr. C., but there is a limit to staving
off, and we have reached it. I have made some advances out of pocket
to accommodate these unpleasantnesses, but I necessarily look to
being repaid, for I do not pretend to be a man of capital, and I have
a father to support in the Vale of Taunton, besides striving to
realize some little independence for three dear girls at home. My
apprehension is, Mr. C.<div class="bookquote">``s circumstances being such, lest it should
end in his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) obtaining leave to part with his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) commission, which at all
events is desirable to be made known to his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) connexions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vholes, who had looked at me while speaking, here emerged into
the silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) could hardly be said to have broken, so stifled was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) tone, and looked before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagine the poor fellow without even his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) present resource,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my
guardian to me. <div class="bookquote">``Yet what can I do? You know him (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>), Esther. He (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) would
never accept of help from me now. To offer it or hint at it would be
to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) to an extremity, if nothing else did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vholes hereupon addressed me again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What Mr. Jarndyce remarks, miss, is no doubt the case, and is the
difficulty. I do not see that anything is to be done. I do not say
that anything is to be done. Far from it. I merely come down here
under the seal of confidence and mention it in order that everything
may be openly carried on and that it may not be said afterwards that
everything was not openly carried on. My wish is that everything
should be openly carried on. I desire to leave a good name behind me.
If I consulted merely my own interests with Mr. C., I should not be
here. So insurmountable, as you must well know, would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
objections. This is not a professional attendance. This can he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
charged to nobody. I have no interest in it except as a member of
society and a father--AND a son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, who had nearly
forgotten that point.

<p/>It appeared to us that Mr. Vholes said neither more nor less than the
truth in intimating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) sought to divide the responsibility, such
as it was, of knowing Richard's situation. I could only suggest that
I should go down to Deal, where Richard was then stationed, and see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), and try if it were possible to avert the worst. Without
consulting Mr. Vholes on this point, I took my guardian aside to
propose it, while Mr. Vholes gauntly stalked to the fire and warmed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) funeral gloves.

<p/>The fatigue of the journey formed an immediate objection on my
guardian's part, but as I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) had no other, and as I was only too
happy to go, I got his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) consent. We had then merely to dispose of Mr.
Vholes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jarndyce, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson will communicate with
Mr. Carstone, and you can only hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>Carstone</b></font>) position may be yet
retrievable. You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) long
black sleeve to check the ringing of the bell, <div class="bookquote">``not any. I thank you,
no, not a morsel. My digestion is much impaired, and I am but a poor
knife and fork at any time. If I was to partake of solid food at this
period of the day, I don't know what the consequences might be.
Everything having been openly carried on, sir, I will now with your
permission take my leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I would that you could take your leave, and we could all take
our leave, Mr. Vholes,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``of a cause
you know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vholes, whose black dye was so deep from head to foot that it had
quite steamed before the fire, diffusing a very unpleasant perfume,
made a short one-sided inclination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) head from the neck and
slowly shook it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We whose ambition it is to be looked upon in the light of
respectable practitioners, sir, can but put our shoulders to the
wheel. We do it, sir. At least, I do it myself; and I wish to think
well of my professional brethren, one and all. You are sensible of an
obligation not to refer to me, miss, in communicating with Mr. C.?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I would be careful not to do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, miss. Good morning. Mr. Jarndyce, good morning, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Vholes put his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) dead glove, which scarcely seemed to have any hand in
it, on my fingers, and then on my guardian's fingers, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
long thin shadow away. I thought of it on the outside of the coach,
passing over all the sunny landscape between us and London, chilling
the seed in the ground as it glided along.

<p/>Of course it became necessary to tell Ada where I was going and why I
was going, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was anxious and distressed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was
too true to Richard to say anything but words of pity and words of
excuse, and in a more loving spirit still--my dear devoted girl!--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) a long letter, of which I took charge.

<p/>Charley was to be my travelling companion, though I am sure I wanted
none and would willingly have left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at home. We all went to London
that afternoon, and finding two places in the mail, secured them. At
our usual bed-time, Charley and I were rolling away seaward with the
Kentish letters.

<p/>It was a night's journey in those coach times, but we had the mail to
ourselves and did not find the night very tedious. It passed with me
as I suppose it would with most people under such circumstances. At
one while my journey looked hopeful, and at another hopeless. Now I
thought I should do some good, and now I wondered how I could ever
have supposed so. Now it seemed one of the most reasonable things in
the world that I should have come, and now one of the most
unreasonable. In what state I should find Richard, what I should say
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would say to me occupied my mind by turns with
these two states of feeling; and the wheels seemed to play one tune
-LRB-to which the burden of my guardian's letter set itself-RRB- over and
over again all night.

<p/>At last we came into the narrow streets of Deal, and very gloomy they
were upon a raw misty morning. The long flat beach, with its little
irregular houses, wooden and brick, and its litter of capstans, and
great boats, and sheds, and bare upright poles with tackle and
blocks, and loose gravelly waste places overgrown with grass and
weeds, wore as dull an appearance as any place I ever saw. The sea
was heaving under a thick white fog; and nothing else was moving but
a few early ropemakers, who, with the yarn twisted round their
bodies, looked as if, tired of their present state of existence, they
were spinning themselves into cordage.

<p/>But when we got into a warm room in an excellent hotel and sat down,
comfortably washed and dressed, to an early breakfast -LRB-for it was too
late to think of going to bed-RRB-, Deal began to look more cheerful. Our
little room was like a ship's cabin, and that delighted Charley very
much. Then the fog began to rise like a curtain, and numbers of ships
that we had had no idea were near appeared. I don't know how many
sail the waiter told us were then lying in the downs. Some of these
vessels were of grand size--one was a large Indiaman just come home;
and when the sun shone through the clouds, making silvery pools in
the dark sea, the way in which these ships brightened, and shadowed,
and changed, amid a bustle of boats pulling off from the shore to
them and from them to the shore, and a general life and motion in
themselves and everything around them, was most beautiful.

<p/>The large Indiaman was our great attraction because she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had come into
the downs in the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was surrounded by boats, and we said how
glad the people on board of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) must be to come ashore. Charley was
curious, too, about the voyage, and about the heat in India, and the
serpents and the tigers; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) picked up such information much
faster than grammar, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) what I knew on those points. I told
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), too, how people in such voyages were sometimes wrecked and cast
on rocks, where they were saved by the intrepidity and humanity of
one man. And Charley asking how that could be, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) how we knew
at home of such a case.

<p/>I had thought of sending Richard a note saying I was there, but it
seemed so much better to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) without preparation. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lived
in barracks I was a little doubtful whether this was feasible, but we
went out to reconnoitre. Peeping in at the gate of the barrack-yard,
we found everything very quiet at that time in the morning, and I
asked a sergeant standing on the guardhouse-steps where he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) lived. He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
sent a man before to show me, who went up some bare stairs, and
knocked with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) knuckles at a door, and left us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard from within. So I left Charley in the
little passage, and going on to the half-open door, said, <div class="bookquote">``Can I come
in, Richard? It's only Dame Durden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was writing at a table, with a great confusion of clothes, tin
cases, books, boots, brushes, and portmanteaus strewn all about the
floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was only half dressed--in plain clothes, I observed, not in
uniform--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hair was unbrushed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) looked as wild as his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
room. All this I saw after he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had heartily welcomed me and I was
seated near him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) started upon hearing my voice and caught me
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) arms in a moment. Dear Richard! He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was ever the same to me.
Down to--ah, poor poor fellow!--to the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never received me but
with something of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) old merry boyish manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heaven, my dear little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how do you come here?
Who could have thought of seeing you! Nothing the matter? Ada is
well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite well. Lovelier than ever, Richard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``My poor cousin! I was
writing to you, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So worn and haggard as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked, even in the fullness of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
handsome youth, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chair and crushing the closely
written sheet of paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been at the trouble of writing all that, and am I not to
read it after all?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) returned with a hopeless gesture. <div class="bookquote">``You may read it
in the whole room. It is all over here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I mildly entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) not to be despondent. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that I had
heard by chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) being in difficulty and had come to consult
with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) what could best be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like you, Esther, but useless, and so NOT like you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) with a
melancholy smile. <div class="bookquote">``I am away on leave this day--should have been gone
in another hour--and that is to smooth it over, for my selling out.
Well! Let bygones be bygones. So this calling follows the rest. I
only want to have been in the church to have made the round of all
the professions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I urged, <div class="bookquote">``it is not so hopeless as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``it is indeed. I am just so near disgrace as
that those who are put in authority over me -LRB-as the catechism goes-RRB-
would far rather be without me than with me. And they are right.
Apart from debts and duns and all such drawbacks, I am not fit even
for this employment. I have no care, no mind, no heart, no soul, but
for one thing. Why, if this bubble hadn't broken now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said,
tearing the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had written into fragments and moodily casting
them away, by driblets, <div class="bookquote">``how could I have gone abroad? I must have
been ordered abroad, but how could I have gone? How could I, with my
experience of that thing, trust even Vholes unless I was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew by my face what I was about to say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) caught
the hand I had laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm and touched my own lips with it to
prevent me from going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Dame Durden! Two subjects I forbid--must forbid. The first is
John Jarndyce. The second, you know what. Call it madness, and I tell
you I can't help it now, and can't be sane. But it is no such thing;
it is the one object I have to pursue. It is a pity I ever was
prevailed upon to turn out of my road for any other. It would be
wisdom to abandon it now, after all the time, anxiety, and pains I
have bestowed upon it! Oh, yes, true wisdom. It would be very
agreeable, too, to some people; but I never will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was in that mood in which I thought it best not to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
determination -LRB-if anything could increase it-RRB- by opposing him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I took
out Ada's letter and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to read it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked.

<p/>As I told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) laid it on the table, and resting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, began. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had not read far when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
two hands--to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face from me. In a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) rose as if
the light were bad and went to the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) finished reading it
there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back towards me, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had finished and had
folded it up, stood there for some minutes with the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
hand. When he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chair, I saw tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Esther, you know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) says here?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spoke in a
softened voice and kissed the letter as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Offers me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went on, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) foot upon the floor, <div class="bookquote">``the little
inheritance she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is certain of so soon--just as little and as much as
I have wasted--and begs and prays me to take it, set myself right
with it, and remain in the service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know your welfare to be the dearest wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<div class="bookquote">``And, oh, my dear Richard, Ada's is a noble heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure it is. I--I wish I was dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went back to the window, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm across it, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
head down on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm. It greatly affected me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) so, but I
hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might become more yielding, and I remained silent. My
experience was very limited; I was not at all prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
rousing himself out of this emotion to a new sense of injury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is the heart that the same John Jarndyce, who is not
otherwise to be mentioned between us, stepped in to estrange from
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``And the dear girl makes me this generous
offer from under the same John Jarndyce's roof, and with the same
John Jarndyce's gracious consent and connivance, I dare say, as a new
means of buying me off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried out, rising hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I will not hear you say such
shameful words!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was very angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) indeed, for the first time
in my life, but it only lasted a moment. When I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) worn young
face looking at me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were sorry, I put my hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shoulder
and said, <div class="bookquote">``If you please, my dear Richard, do not speak in such a
tone to me. Consider!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) blamed himself exceedingly and told me in the most generous manner
that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been very wrong and that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) begged my pardon a thousand
times. At that I laughed, but trembled a little too, for I was rather
fluttered after being so fiery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To accept this offer, my dear Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), sitting down beside
me and resuming our conversation, <div class="bookquote">''--once more, pray, pray forgive
me; I am deeply grieved--to accept my dearest cousin's offer is, I
need not say, impossible. Besides, I have letters and papers that I
could show you which would convince you it is all over here. I have
done with the red coat, believe me. But it is some satisfaction, in
the midst of my troubles and perplexities, to know that I am pressing
Ada's interests in pressing my own. Vholes has his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) shoulder to the
wheel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) cannot help urging it on as much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) as for me,
thank God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sanguine hopes were rising within him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and lighting up his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
features, but they made his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face more sad to me than it had been
before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard exultingly. <div class="bookquote">``If every farthing of Ada's
little fortune were mine, no part of it should be spent in retaining
me in what I am not fit for, can take no interest in, and am weary
of. It should be devoted to what promises a better return, and should
be used where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) has a larger stake. Don't be uneasy for me! I shall
now have only one thing on my mind, and Vholes and I will work it. I
shall not be without means. Free of my commission, I shall be able to
compound with some small usurers who will hear of nothing but their
bond now--Vholes says so. I should have a balance in my favour
anyway, but that would swell it. Come, come! You shall carry a letter
to Ada from me, Esther, and you must both of you be more hopeful of
me and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I will not repeat what I said to Richard. I know it was tiresome, and
nobody is to suppose for a moment that it was at all wise. It only
came from my heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) heard it patiently and feelingly, but I saw
that on the two subjects he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had reserved it was at present hopeless
to make any representation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). I saw too, and had experienced in
this very interview, the sense of my guardian's remark that it was
even more mischievous to use persuasion with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) than to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was.

<p/>Therefore I was driven at last to asking Richard if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would mind
convincing me that it really was all over there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had said, and
that it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mere impression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) showed me without hesitation
a correspondence making it quite plain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) retirement was
arranged. I found, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) told me, that Mr. Vholes had copies
of these papers and had been in consultation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) throughout.
Beyond ascertaining this, and having been the bearer of Ada's letter,
and being -LRB-as I was going to be-RRB- Richard's companion back to London,
I had done no good by coming down. Admitting this to myself with a
reluctant heart, I said I would return to the hotel and wait until he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
joined me there, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) threw a cloak over his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) shoulders and saw me to
the gate, and Charley and I went back along the beach.

<p/>There was a concourse of people in one spot, surrounding some naval
officers who were landing from a boat, and pressing about them with
unusual interest. I said to Charley this would be one of the great
Indiaman's boats now, and we stopped to look.

<p/>The gentlemen came slowly up from the waterside, speaking
good-humouredly to each other and to the people around and glancing
about them as if they were glad to be in England again. <div class="bookquote">``Charley,
Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``come away!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I hurried on so swiftly that my
little maid was surprised.

<p/>It was not until we were shut up in our cabin-room and I had had time
to take breath that I began to think why I had made such haste. In
one of the sunburnt faces I had recognized Mr. Allan Woodcourt, and I
had been afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) recognizing me. I had been unwilling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
should see my altered looks. I had been taken by surprise, and my
courage had quite failed me.

<p/>But I knew this would not do, and I now said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``My dear,
there is no reason--there is and there can be no reason at all--why
it should be worse for you now than it ever has been. What you were
last month, you are to-day; you are no worse, you are no better. This
is not your resolution; call it up, Esther, call it up!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was in a
great tremble--with running--and at first was quite unable to calm
myself; but I got better, and I was very glad to know it.

<p/>The party came to the hotel. I heard them speaking on the staircase.
I was sure it was the same gentlemen because I knew their voices
again--I mean I knew Mr. Woodcourt's. It would still have been a
great relief to me to have gone away without making myself known, but
I was determined not to do so. <div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, no. No, no, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I untied my bonnet and put my veil half up--I think I mean half down,
but it matters very little--and wrote on one of my cards that I
happened to be there with Mr. Richard Carstone, and I sent it in to
Mr. Woodcourt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) came immediately. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) I was rejoiced to be
by chance among the first to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) home to England. And I saw
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was very sorry for me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been in shipwreck and peril since you left us, Mr.
Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but we can hardly call that a misfortune which
enabled you to be so useful and so brave. We read of it with the
truest interest. It first came to my knowledge through your old
patient, poor Miss Flite, when I was recovering from my severe
illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Little Miss Flite!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lives the same life yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was so comfortable with myself now as not to mind the veil and to
be able to put it aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gratitude to you, Mr. Woodcourt, is delightful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is a most
affectionate creature, as I have reason to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You--you have found her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``I--I am glad of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
was so very sorry for me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) could scarcely speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that I was deeply touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sympathy
and pleasure at the time I have referred to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was grieved to hear that you had been very ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have quite recovered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have quite recovered my health and my cheerfulness,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``You
know how good my guardian is and what a happy life we lead, and I
have everything to be thankful for and nothing in the world to
desire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had greater commiseration for me than I had ever had
for myself. It inspired me with new fortitude and new calmness to
find that it was I who was under the necessity of reassuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). I
spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) voyage out and home, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) future plans, and
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) probable return to India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) said that was very doubtful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
had not found himself more favoured by fortune there than here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
had gone out a poor ship's surgeon and had come home nothing better.
While we were talking, and when I was glad to believe that I had
alleviated -LRB-if I may use such a term-RRB- the shock he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had had in seeing
me, Richard came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had heard downstairs who was with me, and
they met with cordial pleasure.

<p/>I saw that after their first greetings were over, and when they spoke
of Richard's career, Mr. Woodcourt had a perception that all was not
going well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) frequently glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) face as if there
were something in it that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) pain, and more than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) looked
towards me as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) sought to ascertain whether I knew what the
truth was. Yet Richard was in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sanguine states and in good
spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see Mr. Woodcourt again, whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had always liked.

<p/>Richard proposed that we all should go to London together; but Mr.
Woodcourt, having to remain by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) ship a little longer, could not
join us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) dined with us, however, at an early hour, and became so
much more like what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) used to be that I was still more at peace to
think I had been able to soften his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) regrets. Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) mind was not
relieved of Richard. When the coach was almost ready and Richard ran
down to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) luggage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) spoke to me about him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/>I was not sure that I had a right to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) whole story open, but I
referred in a few words to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) estrangement from Mr Jarndyce and to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) being entangled in the ill-fated Chancery suit. Mr. Woodcourt
listened with interest and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) regret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) rather closely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) so
changed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) returned, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) head.

<p/>I felt the blood rush into my face for the first time, but it was
only an instantaneous emotion. I turned my head aside, and it was
gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) being so much younger or older,
or thinner or fatter, or paler or ruddier, as there being upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
face such a singular expression. I never saw so remarkable a look in
a young person. One cannot say that it is all anxiety or all
weariness; yet it is both, and like ungrown despair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) looked robust in body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cannot be at peace in mind, we have too much reason to
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I proceeded. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Woodcourt, you are going to London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow or the next day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing Richard wants so much as a friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) always liked
you. Pray see him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) when you get there. Pray help him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sometimes with
your companionship if you can. You do not know of what service it
might be. You cannot think how Ada, and Mr. Jarndyce, and even I--how
we should all thank you, Mr. Woodcourt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) said, more moved than he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had been from the
first, <div class="bookquote">``before heaven, I will be a true friend to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)! I will accept
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as a trust, and it shall be a sacred one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with my eyes filling fast; but I thought
they might, when it was not for myself. <div class="bookquote">``Ada loves him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--we all love
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but Ada loves him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as we cannot. I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) what you say.
Thank you, and God bless you, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) name!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard came back as we finished exchanging these hurried words and
gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arm to take me to the coach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said, unconscious with what application, <div class="bookquote">``pray let us
meet in London!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other. <div class="bookquote">``I have scarcely a friend there now but
you. Where shall I find you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I must get a lodging of some sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, pondering.
<div class="bookquote">``Say at Vholes's, Symond's Inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Without loss of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook hands heartily. When I was seated in the coach and Richard
was yet standing in the street, Mr. Woodcourt laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) friendly hand
on Richard's shoulder and looked at me. I understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) and waved
mine in thanks.

<p/>And in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) last look as we drove away, I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was very sorry
for me. I was glad to see it. I felt for my old self as the dead may
feel if they ever revisit these scenes. I was glad to be tenderly
remembered, to be gently pitied, not to be quite forgotten.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVI

<p/>Stop Him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)!


<p/>Darkness rests upon Tom-All-Alone's. Dilating and dilating since the
sun went down last night, it has gradually swelled until it fills
every void in the place. For a time there were some dungeon lights
burning, as the lamp of life hums in Tom-all-Alone's, heavily,
heavily, in the nauseous air, and winking--as that lamp, too, winks
in Tom-all-Alone's--at many horrible things. But they are blotted
out. The moon has eyed Tom with a dull cold stare, as admitting some
puny emulation of herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) desert region unfit for life and
blasted by volcanic fires; but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has passed on and is gone. The
blackest nightmare in the infernal stables grazes on Tom-all-Alone's,
and Tom is fast asleep.

<p/>Much mighty speech-making there has been, both in and out of
Parliament, concerning Tom, and much wrathful disputation how Tom
shall be got right. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shall be put into the main road by
constables, or by beadles, or by bell-ringing, or by force of
figures, or by correct principles of taste, or by high church, or by
low church, or by no church; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shall be set to splitting
trusses of polemical straws with the crooked knife of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind or
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shall be put to stone-breaking instead. In the midst of
which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear, to wit,
that Tom only may and can, or shall and will, be reclaimed according
to somebody's theory but nobody's practice. And in the hopeful
meantime, Tom goes to perdition head foremost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old determined
spirit.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) revenge. Even the winds are his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) messengers, and they
serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in these hours of darkness. There is not a drop of Tom's
corrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere. It
shall pollute, this very night, the choice stream -LRB-in which chemists
on analysis would find the genuine nobility-RRB- of a Norman house, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) Grace shall not be able to say nay to the infamous alliance.
There is not an atom of Tom's slime, not a cubic inch of any
pestilential gas in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lives, not one obscenity or degradation
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), not an ignorance, not a wickedness, not a brutality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
committing, but shall work its retribution through every order of
society up to the proudest of the proud and to the highest of the
high. Verily, what with tainting, plundering, and spoiling, Tom has
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) revenge.

<p/>It is a moot point whether Tom-all-Alone's be uglier by day or by
night, but on the argument that the more that is seen of it the more
shocking it must be, and that no part of it left to the imagination
is at all likely to be made so bad as the reality, day carries it.
The day begins to break now; and in truth it might be better for the
national glory even that the sun should sometimes set upon the
British dominions than that it should ever rise upon so vile a wonder
as Tom.

<p/>A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep
to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless
pillow, strolls hitherward at this quiet time. Attracted by
curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) often pauses and looks about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), up and down the
miserable by-ways. Nor is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) merely curious, for in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bright dark
eye there is compassionate interest; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looks here and there,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seems to understand such wretchedness and to have studied it
before.

<p/>On the banks of the stagnant channel of mud which is the main street
of Tom-all-Alone's, nothing is to be seen but the crazy houses, shut
up and silent. No waking creature save himself appears except in one
direction, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sees the solitary figure of a woman sitting on a
door-step. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walks that way. Approaching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) observes that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel-stained. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
sits on the door-step in the manner of one who is waiting, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
elbow on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knee and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a canvas
bag, or bundle, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has carried. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is dozing probably, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
gives no heed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) steps as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) comes toward her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>The broken footway is so narrow that when Allan Woodcourt comes to
where the woman sits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) has to turn into the road to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
Looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) eye meets hers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) stops.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you make them hear? Do you want to be let in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm waiting till they get up at another house--a lodging-house--not
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman patiently returns. <div class="bookquote">``I'm waiting here because there
will be sun here presently to warm me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are tired. I am sorry to see you sitting in the
street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir. It don't matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>A habit in him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) of speaking to the poor and of avoiding patronage or
condescension or childishness -LRB-which is the favourite device, many
people deeming it quite a subtlety to talk to them like little
spelling books-RRB- has put him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) on good terms with the woman easily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me look at your forehead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) says, bending down. <div class="bookquote">``I am a
doctor. Don't be afraid. I wouldn't hurt you for the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) knows that by touching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) skilful and accustomed hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
can soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yet more readily. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) makes a slight objection,
saying, <div class="bookquote">``It's nothing'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) has scarcely laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) fingers on the
wounded place when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifts it up to the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! A bad bruise, and the skin sadly broken. This must be very
sore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It do ache a little, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>returns the woman with a started tear
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me try to make it more comfortable. My handkerchief won't hurt
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no, sir, I'm sure of that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) cleanses the injured place and dries it, and having carefully
examined it and gently pressed it with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) hand, takes a
small case from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) pocket, dresses it, and binds it up. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is
thus employed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) says, after laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) establishing a surgery
in the street, <div class="bookquote">``And so your husband is a brickmaker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>asks the woman, astonished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I suppose so from the colour of the clay upon your bag and on
your dress. And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in
different places. And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to
their wives too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman hastily lifts up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would deny that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
injury is referable to such a cause. But feeling the hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
forehead, and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) busy and composed face, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quietly drops
them again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>asks the surgeon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got into trouble last night, sir; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll look for me at the
lodging-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will get into worse trouble if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) often misuses his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) large and
heavy hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has misused it here. But you forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), brutal as
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is, and I say no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), except that I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deserved it.
You have no young child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``One as I calls mine, sir, but it's
Liz's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your own is dead. I see! Poor little thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) has finished and is putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) case. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
you have some settled home. Is it far from here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) asks,
good-humouredly making light of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) has done as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gets up and
curtsys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a good two or three and twenty mile from here, sir. At Saint
Albans. You know Saint Albans, sir? I thought you gave a start like,
as if you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know something of it. And now I will ask you a question in
return. Have you money for your lodging?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``really and truly.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shows it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) tells
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in acknowledgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) many subdued thanks, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is very
welcome, gives her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good day, and walks away. Tom-all-Alone's is still
asleep, and nothing is astir.

<p/>Yes, something is! As he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) retraces his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) way to the point from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
descried the woman at a distance sitting on the step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) sees a
ragged figure coming very cautiously along, crouching close to the
soiled walls--which the wretchedest figure might as well avoid--and
furtively thrusting a hand before it. It is the figure of a youth
whose face is hollow and whose eyes have an emaciated glare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is so
intent on getting along unseen that even the apparition of a stranger
in whole garments does not tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to look back. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shades his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face
with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) ragged elbow as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) passes on the other side of the way, and
goes shrinking and creeping on with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) anxious hand before him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shapeless clothes hanging in shreds. Clothes made for what
purpose, or of what material, it would be impossible to say. They
look, in colour and in substance, like a bundle of rank leaves of
swampy growth that rotted long ago.

<p/>Allan Woodcourt pauses to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) and note all this, with a
shadowy belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) has seen the boy before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) cannot recall how
or where, but there is some association in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) mind with such a form.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) imagines that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) must have seen it in some hospital or refuge,
still, cannot make out why it comes with any special force on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
remembrance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is gradually emerging from Tom-all-Alone's in the morning light,
thinking about it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) hears running feet behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>), and looking
round, sees the boy scouring towards him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at great speed, followed by
the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>), stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cries the woman, almost breathless. <div class="bookquote">``Stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>),
sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) darts across the road into the boy's path, but the boy is quicker
than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), makes a curve, ducks, dives under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, comes up
half-a-dozen yards beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and scours away again. Still the woman
follows, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>), sir, pray stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Allan, not knowing
but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) has just robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money, follows in chase and
runs so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) runs the boy down a dozen times, but each time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) repeats the curve, the duck, the dive, and scours away again. To
strike at him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) on any of these occasions would be to fell and disable
him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>), but the pursuer cannot resolve to do that, and so the grimly
ridiculous pursuit continues. At last the fugitive, hard-pressed,
takes to a narrow passage and a court which has no thoroughfare.
Here, against a hoarding of decaying timber, he (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) is brought to bay and
tumbles down, lying gasping at his (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) pursuer, who stands and gasps at
him (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) until the woman comes up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you, Jo!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cries the woman. <div class="bookquote">``What? I have found you at last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>repeats Allan, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) with attention, <div class="bookquote">``Jo! Stay. To be
sure! I recollect this lad some time ago being brought before the
coroner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I see you once afore at the inkwhich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>whimpers Jo. <div class="bookquote">``What of
that? Can't you never let such an unfortnet as me alone? An't I
unfortnet enough for you yet? How unfortnet do you want me fur to be?
I've been a-chivied and a-chivied, fust by one on you and nixt by
another on you, till I'm worritted to skins and bones. The inkwhich
warn't MY fault. I done nothink. He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) wos wery good to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) wos; he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>)
wos the only one I knowed to speak to, as ever come across my
crossing. It ain't wery likely I should want him (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) to be inkwhiched. I
only wish I wos, myself. I don't know why I don't go and make a hole
in the water, I'm sure I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) says it with such a pitiable air, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) grimy tears appear so
real, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a
growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in
neglect and impurity, that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) says to the woman, <div class="bookquote">``Miserable creature, what has he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>To which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only replies, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head at the prostrate figure
more amazedly than angrily, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you Jo, you Jo. I have found you at
last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>says Allan. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) robbed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, no. Robbed me? He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) did nothing but what was kind-hearted by
me, and that's the wonder of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan looks from Jo to the woman, and from the woman to Jo, waiting
for one of them to unravel the riddle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) was along with me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>says the woman. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you Jo! He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) was
along with me, sir, down at Saint Albans, ill, and a young lady, Lord
bless her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for a good friend to me, took pity on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) when I durstn't,
and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) home--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan shrinks back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) with a sudden horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, yes. Took him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) home, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) comfortable, and like a
thankless monster he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) ran away in the night and never has been seen or
heard of since till I set eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) just now. And that young lady
that was such a pretty dear caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) illness, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beautiful
looks, and wouldn't hardly be known for the same young lady now if it
wasn't for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) angel temper, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty shape, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sweet
voice. Do you know it? You ungrateful wretch, do you know that this
is all along of you and of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) goodness to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>demands the woman</b></font>)</div>demands the woman,
beginning to rage at him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) recalls it and breaking into
passionate tears.

<p/>The boy, in rough sort stunned by what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hears, falls to smearing
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dirty forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dirty palm, and to staring at the ground,
and to shaking from head to foot until the crazy hoarding against
which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leans rattles.

<p/>Allan restrains the woman, merely by a quiet gesture, but
effectually.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard told me--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) falters. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, I have heard of this--don't
mind me for a moment, I will speak presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered
passage. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) comes back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) has recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) composure, except
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) contends against an avoidance of the boy, which is so very
remarkable that it absorbs the woman's attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says. But get up, get up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo, shaking and chattering, slowly rises and stands, after the manner
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) tribe in a difficulty, sideways against the hoarding, resting
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) high shoulders against it and covertly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) right
hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) left and his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) left foot over his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says, and I know it's true. Have you been here
ever since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wishermaydie if I seen Tom-all-Alone's till this blessed morning,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replies Jo hoarsely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have you come here now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo looks all round the confined court, looks at his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) questioner no
higher than the knees, and finally answers, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to do
nothink, and I can't get nothink to do. I'm wery poor and ill, and I
thought I'd come back here when there warn't nobody about, and lay

 (<font color='red'><b>questioner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo looks all round the court again, looks at his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) questioner's knees
again, and concludes by laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) profile against the hoarding in a
sort of resignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear me ask you where you have come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tramp then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>proceeds Allan, making a strong effort to overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
repugnance, going very near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>), and leaning over him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) with an
expression of confidence, <div class="bookquote">``tell me how it came about that you left
that house when the good young lady had been so unfortunate as to
pity you and take you home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo suddenly comes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) resignation and excitedly declares,
addressing the woman, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) never known about the young lady, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) never heern about it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) never went fur to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
would sooner have hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) own self, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'d sooner have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
unfortnet ed chopped off than ever gone a-nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wos
wery good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wos. Conducting himself throughout as if in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
poor fashion he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) really meant it, and winding up with some very
miserable sobs.

<p/>Allan Woodcourt sees that this is not a sham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) constrains himself
to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come, Jo. Tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I dustn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, relapsing into the profile state. <div class="bookquote">``I
dustn't, or I would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns the other, <div class="bookquote">``all the same. Come, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>After two or three such adjurations, Jo lifts up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) head again,
looks round the court again, and says in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll
tell you something. I was took away. There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Took away? In the night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>Very apprehensive of being overheard, Jo looks about him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) and
even glances up some ten feet at the top of the hoarding and through
the cracks in it lest the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) distrust should be looking
over or hidden on the other side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who took you away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dustn't name him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo. ``I dustn't do it, sir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want, in the young lady's name, to know. You may trust me. No
one else shall hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replies Jo, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) head fearfully, ``as

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is not in this place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s in all manner of places, all at
wanst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) in perplexity, but discovers some real meaning and
good faith at the bottom of this bewildering reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) patiently
awaits an explicit answer; and Jo, more baffled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) patience than
by anything else, at last desperately whispers a name in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>says Allan. <div class="bookquote">``Why, what had you been doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothink, sir. Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, we will try to prevent that. But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put me in a horsepittle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>replied Jo, whispering, ``till I was
discharged, then giv me a little money--four half-bulls, wot you may
call half-crowns--and ses ``Hook it! Nobody wants you here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) ses.
``You hook it. You go and tramp,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) ses. ``You move on,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) ses.
``Don't let me ever see you nowheres within forty mile of London, or

former precautions and investigations.

<p/>Allan considers a little, then remarks, turning to the woman but
keeping an encouraging eye on Jo, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) is not so ungrateful as you
supposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) had a reason for going away, though it was an

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day again, sir, and I thank you kindly many times again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has been sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bag, deeply attentive, and now rises and
takes it up. Jo, repeating, <div class="bookquote">``Ony you tell the young lady as I never
went fur to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and wot the genlmn ses!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>nods and shambles and
shivers, and smears and blinks, and half laughs and half cries, a
farewell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) creeping way along after Allan
Woodcourt, close to the houses on the opposite side of the street. In
this order, the two come up out of Tom-all-Alone's into the broad
rays of the sunlight and the purer air.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII

<p/>Jo's Will


<p/>As Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets where the high
church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning
light that the city itself seems renewed by rest, Allan revolves in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) mind how and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) shall bestow his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``It surely is a
strange fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) considers, <div class="bookquote">``that in the heart of a civilized world
this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of
than an unowned dog.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But it is none the less a fact because of its
strangeness, and the difficulty remains.

<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) looks behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) often to assure himself that Jo is still
really following. But look where he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) still beholds him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) close
to the opposite houses, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) way with his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) wary hand from brick
to brick and from door to door, and often, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) creeps along,
glancing over at him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) watchfully. Soon satisfied that the last thing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) thoughts is to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) the slip, Allan goes on, considering
with a less divided attention what he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) shall do.

<p/>A breakfast-stall at a street-corner suggests the first thing to be
done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) stops there, looks round, and beckons Jo. Jo crosses and
comes halting and shuffling up, slowly scooping the knuckles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) left, kneading
dirt with a natural pestle and mortar. What is a dainty repast to Jo
is then set before him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw
the bread and butter, looking anxiously about him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) in all directions
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) eats and drinks, like a scared animal.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I thought I was amost a-starvin, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, soon putting down
his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) food, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't know nothink--not even that. I don't care for
eating wittles nor yet for drinking on 'em.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>And Jo stands shivering
and looking at the breakfast wonderingly.

<p/>Allan Woodcourt lays his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) pulse and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) chest. <div class="bookquote">``Draw
breath, Jo!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It draws,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, <div class="bookquote">``as heavy as a cart.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) might add,
<div class="bookquote">``And rattles like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) only mutters, <div class="bookquote">``I'm a-moving on, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan looks about for an apothecary's shop. There is none at hand,
but a tavern does as well or better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) obtains a little measure of
wine and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) begins to
revive almost as soon as it passes his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``We may repeat that
dose, Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>observes Allan after watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) attentive face.
<div class="bookquote">``So! Now we will take five minutes' rest, and then go on again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaving the boy sitting on the bench of the breakfast-stall, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
back against an iron railing, Allan Woodcourt paces up and down in
the early sunshine, casting an occasional look towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) without
appearing to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). It requires no discernment to perceive that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is warmed and refreshed. If a face so shaded can brighten, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
face brightens somewhat; and by little and little he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) eats the slice
of bread he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had so hopelessly laid down. Observant of these signs of
improvement, Allan engages him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) in conversation and elicits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) no
small wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil, with all its
consequences. Jo slowly munches as he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) slowly tells it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) has
finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) story and his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) bread, they go on again.

<p/>Intending to refer his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) difficulty in finding a temporary place of
refuge for the boy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) old patient, zealous little Miss Flite,
Allan leads the way to the court where he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) and Jo first foregathered.
But all is changed at the rag and bottle shop; Miss Flite no longer
lodges there; it is shut up; and a hard-featured female, much
obscured by dust, whose age is a problem, but who is indeed no other
than the interesting Judy, is tart and spare in her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) replies. These
sufficing, however, to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
birds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder, in Bell Yard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yard</b></font>) repairs to
that neighbouring place, where Miss Flite -LRB-who rises early that she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>)
may be punctual at the divan of justice held by her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) excellent friend
the Chancellor-RRB- comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and
with open arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear physician!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries Miss Flite. <div class="bookquote">``My meritorious,
distinguished, honourable officer!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) uses some odd expressions,
but is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be--more so
than it often is. Allan, very patient with her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>), waits until she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) has
no more raptures to express, then points out Jo, trembling in a
doorway, and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) comes there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where can I lodge him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hereabouts for the present? Now, you have a
fund of knowledge and good sense and can advise me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Flite, mighty proud of the compliment, sets herself to consider;
but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). Mrs. Blinder is
entirely let, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) herself occupies poor Gridley's room.
<div class="bookquote">``Gridley!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaims Miss Flite, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) hands after a twentieth
repetition of this remark. <div class="bookquote">``Gridley! To be sure! Of course! My dear
physician! General George will help us out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div><p/>It is hopeless to ask for any information about General George, and
would be, though Miss Flite had not already run upstairs to put on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) pinched bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) poor little shawl and to arm herself with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) reticule of documents. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) physician in her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>)
disjointed manner on coming down in full array that General George,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) often calls upon, knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>) dear Fitz Jarndyce and takes a
great interest in all connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Blinder</b></font>), Allan is induced to think
that they may be in the right way. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) tells Jo, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
encouragement, that this walking about will soon be over now; and
they repair to the general's. Fortunately it is not far.

<p/>From the exterior of George's Shooting Gallery, and the long entry,
and the bare perspective beyond it, Allan Woodcourt augurs well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
also descries promise in the figure of Mr. George himself, striding
towards them in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) morning exercise with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth, no
stock on, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) muscular arms, developed by broadsword and
dumbbell, weightily asserting themselves through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) light
shirt-sleeves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George with a military salute.
Good-humouredly smiling all over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) broad forehead up into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) crisp
hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then defers to Miss Flite, as, with great stateliness, and
at some length, she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) performs the courtly ceremony of presentation. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
winds it up with another <div class="bookquote">``Your servant, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and another salute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, sir. A sailor, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am proud to find I have the air of one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>returns Allan; <div class="bookquote">``but I am
only a sea-going doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir! I should have thought you was a regular blue-jacket
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan hopes Mr. George will forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) intrusion the more readily on
that account, and particularly that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will not lay aside his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe,
which, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) politeness, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has testified some intention of doing.
<div class="bookquote">``You are very good, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper. <div class="bookquote">``As I know by
experience that it's not disagreeable to Miss Flite, and since it's
equally agreeable to yourself--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>and finishes the sentence by putting
it between his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips again. Allan proceeds to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) knows
about Jo, unto which the trooper listens with a grave face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's the lad, sir, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) inquires, looking along the
entry to where Jo stands staring up at the great letters on the
whitewashed front, which have no meaning in his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>says Allan. <div class="bookquote">``And, Mr. George, I am in this difficulty
about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). I am unwilling to place him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in a hospital, even if I could
procure him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) immediate admission, because I foresee that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would not
stay there many hours if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could be so much as got there. The same
objection applies to a workhouse, supposing I had the patience to be
evaded and shirked, and handed about from post to pillar in trying to
get him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) into one, which is a system that I don't take kindly to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No man does, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not remain in either place, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is possessed by an extraordinary terror of this person who ordered
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to keep out of the way; in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ignorance, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believes this person
to be everywhere, and cognizant of everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``But you have not
mentioned that party's name. Is it a secret, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy makes it one. But his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name is Bucket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bucket the detective, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is known to me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper after blowing out
a cloud of smoke and squaring his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chest, <div class="bookquote">``and the boy is so far
correct that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) undoubtedly is a--rum customer.''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>Mr. George smokes
with a profound meaning after this and surveys Miss Flite in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I wish Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson at least to know that
this Jo, who tells so strange a story, has reappeared, and to have it
in their power to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) if they should desire to do so.
Therefore I want to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), for the present moment, into any poor
lodging kept by decent people where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) would be admitted. Decent
people and Jo, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>says Allan, following the direction of
the trooper's eyes along the entry, <div class="bookquote">``have not been much acquainted,
as you see. Hence the difficulty. Do you happen to know any one in
this neighbourhood who would receive him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for a while on my paying for
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) beforehand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) puts the question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) becomes aware of a dirty-faced little man
standing at the trooper's elbow and looking up, with an oddly twisted
figure and countenance, into the trooper's face. After a few more
puffs at his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) pipe, the trooper looks down askant at the little man,
and the little man winks up at the trooper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``I can assure you that I would
willingly be knocked on the head at any time if it would be at all
agreeable to Miss Summerson, and consequently I esteem it a privilege
to do that young lady any service, however small. We are naturally in
the vagabond way here, sir, both myself and Phil. You see what the
place is. You are welcome to a quiet corner of it for the boy if the
same would meet your views. No charge made, except for rations. We
are not in a flourishing state of circumstances here, sir. We are
liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment's notice. However,
sir, such as the place is, and so long as it lasts, here it is at
your service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>With a comprehensive wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe, Mr. George places the whole
building at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) visitor's disposal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I take it for granted, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) adds, <div class="bookquote">``you being one of the medical
staff, that there is no present infection about this unfortunate
subject?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan is quite sure of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head sorrowfully, <div class="bookquote">``we
have had enough of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) new acquaintance.
<div class="bookquote">``Still I am bound to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>observes Allan after repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
former assurance, <div class="bookquote">``that the boy is deplorably low and reduced and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) may be--I do not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is--too far gone to recover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you consider him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in present danger, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>inquires the trooper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I fear so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper in a decisive manner, <div class="bookquote">``it appears to
me--being naturally in the vagabond way myself--that the sooner he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
comes out of the street, the better. You, Phil! Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Squod tacks out, all on one side, to execute the word of command;
and the trooper, having smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) pipe, lays it by. Jo is brought
in. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle's Tockahoopo Indians; he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is not
one of Mrs. Jellyby's lambs, being wholly unconnected with
Borrioboola-Gha; he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity; he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
is not a genuine foreign-grown savage; he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is the ordinary home-made
article. Dirty, ugly, disagreeable to all the senses, in body a
common creature of the common streets, only in soul a heathen. Homely
filth begrimes him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), homely parasites devour him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), homely sores are in
him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), homely rags are on him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>); native ignorance, the growth of English
soil and climate, sinks his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) immortal nature lower than the beasts
that perish. Stand forth, Jo, in uncompromising colours! From the
sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head, there is nothing
interesting about thee.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) shuffles slowly into Mr. George's gallery and stands huddled
together in a bundle, looking all about the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) seems to know
that they have an inclination to shrink from him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), partly for what he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
is and partly for what he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) has caused. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), too, shrinks from them. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
is not of the same order of things, not of the same place in
creation. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is of no order and no place, neither of the beasts nor
of humanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Jo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>says Allan. <div class="bookquote">``This is Mr. George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo searches the floor for some time longer, then looks up for a
moment, and then down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a kind friend to you, for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is going to give you lodging room
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo makes a scoop with one hand, which is supposed to be a bow. After
a little more consideration and some backing and changing of the foot
on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) rests, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) mutters that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``wery thankful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite safe here. All you have to do at present is to be
obedient and to get strong. And mind you tell us the truth here,
whatever you do, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wishermaydie if I don't, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, reverting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) favourite
declaration. <div class="bookquote">``I never done nothink yit, but wot you knows on, to get
myself into no trouble. I never was in no other trouble at all, sir,
`sept not knowin' nothink and starwation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it, now attend to Mr. George. I see he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is going to speak
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My intention merely was, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>observes Mr. George, amazingly broad
and upright, <div class="bookquote">``to point out to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can lie down and get a
thorough good dose of sleep. Now, look here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>As the trooper speaks,
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) conducts them to the other end of the gallery and opens one of the
little cabins. <div class="bookquote">``There you are, you see! Here is a mattress, and here
you may rest, on good behaviour, as long as Mr., I ask your pardon,
sir'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) refers apologetically to the card Allan has given him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Woodcourt pleases. Don't you be alarmed if you hear shots; they'll be
aimed at the target, and not you. Now, there's another thing I would
recommend, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) visitor. <div class="bookquote">``Phil,
come here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil bears down upon them according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) usual tactics. <div class="bookquote">``Here is a
man, sir, who was found, when a baby, in the gutter. Consequently, it
is to be expected that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a natural interest in this poor
creature. You do, don't you, Phil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly and surely I do, guv`ner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil/Phil Squod</b></font>)</div>is Phil's reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I was thinking, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George in a martial sort of
confidence, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were giving his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) opinion in a council of war at a
drum-head, <div class="bookquote">``that if this man was to take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a bath and was to lay
out a few shillings in getting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one or two coarse articles--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George, my considerate friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returns Allan, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
purse, <div class="bookquote">``it is the very favour I would have asked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Phil Squod and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of
improvement. Miss Flite, quite enraptured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) success, makes the
best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) way to court, having great fears that otherwise her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
friend the Chancellor may be uneasy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) or may give the
judgment she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has so long expected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) absence, and observing
<div class="bookquote">``which you know, my dear physician, and general, after so many years,
would be too absurdly unfortunate!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Allan takes the opportunity of
going out to procure some restorative medicines, and obtaining them
near at hand, soon returns to find the trooper walking up and down
the gallery, and to fall into step and walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I take it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``that you know Miss Summerson
pretty well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, it appears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No, it appears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse the apparent curiosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. ``It seemed to me
probable that you might take more than a common interest in this poor
creature because Miss Summerson had taken that unfortunate interest
in him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tis MY case, sir, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And mine, Mr. George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper looks sideways at Allan's sunburnt cheek and bright dark
eye, rapidly measures his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) height and build, and seems to approve of
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you have been out, sir, I have been thinking that I
unquestionably know the rooms in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Bucket
took the lad, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) account. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is not acquainted
with the name, I can help you to it. It's Tulkinghorn. That's what it
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) inquiringly, repeating the name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tulkinghorn. That's the name, sir. I know the man, and know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
have been in communication with Bucket before, respecting a deceased
person who had given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offence. I know the man, sir. To my sorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Allan naturally asks what kind of man he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) is.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What kind of man! Do you mean to look at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know that much of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I mean to deal with. Generally,
what kind of man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then I'll tell you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper, stopping short
and folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) arms on his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) square chest so angrily that his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) face
fires and flushes all over; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a confoundedly bad kind of man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is a slow-torturing kind of man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is no more like flesh and blood
than a rusty old carbine is. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a kind of man--by George!--that
has caused me more restlessness, and more uneasiness, and more
dissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together. That's
the kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>says Allan, <div class="bookquote">``to have touched so sore a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sore?''  (<font color='red'><b>trooper</b></font>)</div>The trooper plants his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) legs wider apart, wets the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
broad right hand, and lays it on the imaginary moustache. <div class="bookquote">``It's no
fault of yours, sir; but you shall judge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) has got a power over me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is the man I spoke of just now as being able to tumble me out of
this place neck and crop. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeps me on a constant see-saw. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't
hold off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't come on. If I have a payment to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or
time to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for, or anything to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't see me,
don't hear me--passes me on to Melchisedech's in Clifford's Inn,
Melchisedech's in Clifford's Inn passes me back again to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
keeps me prowling and dangling about him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) as if I was made of the same
stone as himself. Why, I spend half my life now, pretty well,
loitering and dodging about his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) door. What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) care? Nothing.
Just as much as the rusty old carbine I have compared him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
chafes and goads me till--Bah! Nonsense! I am forgetting myself. Mr.
Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>the trooper resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) march, <div class="bookquote">``all I say is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is an
old man; but I am glad I shall never have the chance of setting spurs
to my horse and riding at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a fair field. For if I had that
chance, in one of the humours he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drives me into--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d go down, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George has been so excited that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) finds it necessary to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
forehead on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shirt-sleeve. Even while he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whistles his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) impetuosity
away with the national anthem, some involuntary shakings of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head
and heavings of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chest still linger behind, not to mention an
occasional hasty adjustment with both hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) open shirt-collar,
as if it were scarcely open enough to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) being troubled by a
choking sensation. In short, Allan Woodcourt has not much doubt about
the going down of Mr. Tulkinghorn on the field referred to.

<p/>Jo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) conductor presently return, and Jo is assisted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
mattress by the careful Phil, to whom, after due administration of
medicine by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own hands, Allan confides all needful means and
instructions. The morning is by this time getting on apace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
repairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) lodgings to dress and breakfast, and then, without
seeking rest, goes away to Mr. Jarndyce to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) discovery.

<p/>With him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) Mr. Jarndyce returns alone, confidentially telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) that
there are reasons for keeping this matter very quiet indeed and
showing a serious interest in it. To Mr. Jarndyce, Jo repeats in
substance what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said in the morning, without any material
variation. Only that cart of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is heavier to draw, and draws with a
hollower sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me lay here quiet and not be chivied no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>falters Jo, <div class="bookquote">``and
be so kind any person as is a-passin nigh where I used fur to sleep,
as jist to say to Mr. Sangsby that Jo, wot he (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) known once, is a-moving
on right forards with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) duty, and I'll be wery thankful. I'd be
more thankful than I am aready if it wos any ways possible for an
unfortnet to be it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) makes so many of these references to the law-stationer in the
course of a day or two that Allan, after conferring with Mr.
Jarndyce, good-naturedly resolves to call in Cook's Court, the
rather, as the cart seems to be breaking down.

<p/>To Cook's Court, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) repairs. Mr. Snagsby is behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
counter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) grey coat and sleeves, inspecting an indenture of
several skins which has just come in from the engrosser's, an immense
desert of law-hand and parchment, with here and there a resting-place
of a few large letters to break the awful monotony and save the
traveller from despair. Mr Snagsby puts up at one of these inky wells
and greets the stranger with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) cough of general preparation for
business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't remember me, Mr. Snagsby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The stationer</b></font>)</div><p/>The stationer's heart begins to thump heavily, for his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) old
apprehensions have never abated. It is as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) can do to
answer, <div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I can't say I do. I should have considered--not to
put too fine a point upon it--that I never saw you before, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twice before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>says Allan Woodcourt. <div class="bookquote">``Once at a poor bedside, and
once--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's come at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>thinks the afflicted stationer, as recollection
breaks upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's got to a head now and is going to burst!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) has sufficient presence of mind to conduct his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) visitor into the
little counting-house and to shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you a married man, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you make the attempt, though single,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby in a
melancholy whisper, <div class="bookquote">``to speak as low as you can? For my little woman
is a-listening somewheres, or I'll forfeit the business and five
hundred pound!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>In deep dejection Mr. Snagsby sits down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) stool, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) back
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) desk, protesting, <div class="bookquote">``I never had a secret of my own, sir. I
can't charge my memory with ever having once attempted to deceive my
little woman on my own account since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) named the day. I wouldn't
have done it, sir. Not to put too fine a point upon it, I couldn't
have done it, I dursn't have done it. Whereas, and nevertheless, I
find myself wrapped round with secrecy and mystery, till my life is a
burden to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) visitor professes his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) regret to hear it and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) does he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
remember Jo. Mr. Snagsby answers with a suppressed groan, oh, don't
he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't name an individual human being--except myself--that my
little woman is more set and determined against than Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Snagsby.

<p/>Allan asks why.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. Snagsby, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) desperation clutching at the clump
of hair at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) bald head. <div class="bookquote">``How should I know why? But you
are a single person, sir, and may you long be spared to ask a married
person such a question!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>With this beneficent wish, Mr. Snagsby coughs a cough of dismal
resignation and submits himself to hear what the visitor has to
communicate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby, who, between the earnestness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)
feelings and the suppressed tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) voice is discoloured in the
face. <div class="bookquote">``At it again, in a new direction! A certain person charges me,
in the solemnest way, not to talk of Jo to any one, even my little
woman. Then comes another certain person, in the person of yourself,
and charges me, in an equally solemn way, not to mention Jo to that
other certain person above all other persons. Why, this is a private
asylum! Why, not to put too fine a point upon it, this is Bedlam,
sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Snagsby.

<p/>But it is better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) expected after all, being no explosion of
the mine below him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) or deepening of the pit into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has fallen.
And being tender-hearted and affected by the account he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hears of Jo's
condition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) readily engages to <div class="bookquote">``look round''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as early in the evening
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) can manage it quietly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) looks round very quietly when the
evening comes, but it may turn out that Mrs. Snagsby is as quiet a
manager as he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>).

<p/>Jo is very glad to see his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) old friend and says, when they are left
alone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) takes it uncommon kind as Mr. Sangsby should come so
far out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) way on accounts of sich as him (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>). Mr. Snagsby, touched
by the spectacle before him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), immediately lays upon the table half a
crown, that magic balsam of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) for all kinds of wounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you find yourself, my poor lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>inquires the stationer
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) cough of sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in luck, Mr. Sangsby, I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>returns Jo, <div class="bookquote">``and don't want for
nothink. I'm more cumfbler nor you can't think. Mr. Sangsby! I'm wery
sorry that I done it, but I didn't go fur to do it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>The stationer softly lays down another half-crown and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) what
it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is sorry for having done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sangsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, ``I went and giv a illness to the lady as wos
and yit as warn't the t`other lady, and none of 'em never says
nothink to me for having done it, on accounts of their being ser good
and my having been s`unfortnet. The lady come herself and see me
yesday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ses, ``Ah, Jo!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ses. ``We thought we'd lost you,
Jo!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ses. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sits down a-smilin so quiet, and don't pass a
word nor yit a look upon me for having done it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) don't, and I
turns agin the wall, I doos, Mr. Sangsby. And Mr. Jarnders, I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
a-forced to turn away his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own self. And Mr. Woodcot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcot</b></font>) come fur to
giv me somethink fur to ease me, wot he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcot</b></font>)'s allus a-doin' on day and
night, and wen he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcot</b></font>) come a-bending over me and a-speakin up so bold, I
see his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcot</b></font>) tears a-fallin, Mr. Sangsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>The softened stationer deposits another half-crown on the table.
Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wot I was a-thinkin on, Mr. Sangsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>proceeds Jo, <div class="bookquote">``wos, as you wos
able to write wery large, p`raps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jo, please God,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stationer</b></font>)</div>returns the stationer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncommon precious large, p`raps?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo with eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my poor boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo laughs with pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``Wot I wos a-thinking on then, Mr. Sangsby,
wos, that when I wos moved on as fur as ever I could go and couldn't
be moved no furder, whether you might be so good p`raps as to write
out, wery large so that any one could see it anywheres, as that I wos
wery truly hearty sorry that I done it and that I never went fur to
do it, and that though I didn't know nothink at all, I knowd as Mr.
Woodcot once cried over it and wos allus grieved over it, and that I
hoped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcot</b></font>)'d be able to forgive me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcot</b></font>) mind. If the writin could
be made to say it wery large, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcot</b></font>) might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall say it, Jo. Very large.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo laughs again. <div class="bookquote">``Thankee, Mr. Sangsby. It's wery kind of you, sir,
and it makes me more cumfbler nor I was afore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The stationer</b></font>)</div><p/>The meek little stationer, with a broken and unfinished cough, slips
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) fourth half-crown--he (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) has never been so close to a case
requiring so many--and is fain to depart. And Jo and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>), upon this
little earth, shall meet no more. No more.

<p/>For the cart so hard to draw is near its journey's end and drags over
stony ground. All round the clock it labours up the broken steps,
shattered and worn. Not many times can the sun rise and behold it
still upon its weary road.

<p/>Phil Squod, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) smoky gunpowder visage, at once acts as nurse
and works as armourer at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) little table in a corner, often looking
round and saying with a nod of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) green-baize cap and an encouraging
elevation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squod</b></font>) one eyebrow, <div class="bookquote">``Hold up, my boy! Hold up!''  (<font color='red'><b>armourer</b></font>)</div>There, too,
is Mr. Jarndyce many a time, and Allan Woodcourt almost always, both
thinking, much, how strangely fate has entangled this rough outcast
in the web of very different lives. There, too, the trooper is a
frequent visitor, filling the doorway with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) athletic figure and,
from his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) superfluity of life and strength, seeming to shed down
temporary vigour upon Jo, who never fails to speak more robustly in
answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) cheerful words.

<p/>Jo is in a sleep or in a stupor to-day, and Allan Woodcourt, newly
arrived, stands by him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>), looking down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) wasted form. After a
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) softly seats himself upon the bedside with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) face towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) sat in the law-writer's room--and touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) chest
and heart. The cart had very nearly given up, but labours on a little
more.

<p/>The trooper stands in the doorway, still and silent. Phil has stopped
in a low clinking noise, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) little hammer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) hand. Mr.
Woodcourt looks round with that grave professional interest and
attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) face, and glancing significantly at the trooper,
signs to Phil to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) table out. When the little hammer is next
used, there will be a speck of rust upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Jo! What is the matter? Don't be frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>says Jo, who has started and is looking round, <div class="bookquote">``I
thought I was in Tom-all-Alone's agin. Ain't there nobody here but
you, Mr. Woodcot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I ain't took back to Tom-all-Alone's. Am I, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>Jo closes his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) eyes, muttering, <div class="bookquote">``I'm wery thankful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>After watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) closely a little while, Allan puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) mouth very
near his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) ear and says to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) in a low, distinct voice, <div class="bookquote">``Jo! Did you
ever know a prayer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never knowd nothink, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much as one short prayer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. Nothink at all. Mr. Chadbands he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wos a-prayin wunst at Mr.
Sangsby's and I heerd him (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) wos a-speakin to
hisself, and not to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sangsby</b></font>) prayed a lot, but I couldn't make out
nothink on it. Different times there was other genlmen come down
Tom-all-Alone's a-prayin, but they all mostly sed as the t`other
`wuns prayed wrong, and all mostly sounded to be a-talking to
theirselves, or a-passing blame on the t`others, and not a-talkin to
us. WE never knowd nothink. I never knowd what it wos all about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) a long time to say this, and few but an experienced and
attentive listener could hear, or, hearing, understand him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>). After a
short relapse into sleep or stupor, he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) makes, of a sudden, a strong
effort to get out of bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Jo! What now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's time for me to go to that there berryin ground, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>)
returns with a wild look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lie down, and tell me. What burying ground, Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Where they laid him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) as wos wery good to me, wery good to me indeed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) wos. It's time fur me to go down to that there berryin ground,
sir, and ask to be put along with him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>). I wants to go there and be

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By and by, Jo. By and by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! P'raps they wouldn't do it if I wos to go myself. But will you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is coming fast, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fast. The cart is shaken all to pieces, and the rugged road is very
near its end.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear you, sir, in the dark, but I'm a-gropin--a-gropin--let me

us every day.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII

<p/>Closing In


<p/>The place in Lincolnshire has shut its many eyes again, and the house
in town is awake. In Lincolnshire the Dedlocks of the past doze in
their picture-frames, and the low wind murmurs through the long
drawing-room as if they were breathing pretty regularly. In town the
Dedlocks of the present rattle in their fire-eyed carriages through
the darkness of the night, and the Dedlock Mercuries, with ashes -LRB-or
hair-powder-RRB- on their heads, symptomatic of their great humility,
loll away the drowsy mornings in the little windows of the hall. The
fashionable world--tremendous orb, nearly five miles round--is in
full swing, and the solar system works respectfully at its appointed
distances.

<p/>Where the throng is thickest, where the lights are brightest, where
all the senses are ministered to with the greatest delicacy and
refinement, Lady Dedlock is. From the shining heights she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has scaled
and taken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is never absent. Though the belief she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) of old reposed
in herself as one able to reserve whatsoever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) would under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) mantle of pride is beaten down, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has no assurance
that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is to those around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) will remain another day,
it is not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) nature when envious eyes are looking on to
yield or to droop. They say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has lately grown
more handsome and more haughty. The debilitated cousin says of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)'s beauty nough--tsetup shopofwomen--but rather
larming kind--remindingmanfact--inconvenient woman--who WILL
getoutofbedandbawthstahlishment--Shakespeare.

<p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, looks nothing. Now, as heretofore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
is to be found in doorways of rooms, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) limp white cravat
loosely twisted into its old-fashioned tie, receiving patronage from
the peerage and making no sign. Of all men he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is still the last who
might be supposed to have any influence upon my Lady. Of all women
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is still the last who might be supposed to have any dread of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).

<p/>One thing has been much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mind since their late interview in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
turret-room at Chesney Wold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is now decided, and prepared to
throw it off.

<p/>It is morning in the great world, afternoon according to the little
sun. The Mercuries, exhausted by looking out of window, are reposing
in the hall and hang their heavy heads, the gorgeous creatures, like
overblown sunflowers. Like them, too, they seem to run to a deal of
seed in their tags and trimmings. Sir Leicester, in the library, has
fallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a
Parliamentary committee. My Lady sits in the room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gave
audience to the young man of the name of Guppy. Rosa is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and
has been writing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and reading to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). Rosa is now at work upon
embroidery or some such pretty thing, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) bends her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head over
it, my Lady watches her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) in silence. Not for the first time to-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rosa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pretty village face looks brightly up. Then, seeing how serious
my Lady is, looks puzzled and surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See to the door. Is it shut?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) goes to it and returns, and looks yet more surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am about to place confidence in you, child, for I know I may trust
your attachment, if not your judgment. In what I am going to do, I
will not disguise myself to you at least. But I confide in you. Say
nothing to any one of what passes between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The timid little beauty promises in all earnestness to be
trustworthy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Lady Dedlock asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), signing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
chair nearer, <div class="bookquote">``do you know, Rosa, that I am different to you from
what I am to any one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my Lady. Much kinder. But then I often think I know you as you
really are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You often think you know me as I really am? Poor child, poor child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) says it with a kind of scorn--though not of Rosa--and sits
brooding, looking dreamily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think, Rosa, you are any relief or comfort to me? Do you
suppose your being young and natural, and fond of me and grateful to
me, makes it any pleasure to me to have you near me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, my Lady; I can scarcely hope so. But with all my
heart, I wish it was so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so, little one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pretty face is checked in its flush of pleasure by the dark
expression on the handsome face before it. It looks timidly for an
explanation.

<p/>``And if I were to say to-day, ``Go! Leave me!<div class="bookquote">'' I should say what would
give me great pain and disquiet, child, and what would leave me very
solitary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady! Have I offended you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In nothing. Come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosa</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosa bends down on the footstool at my Lady's feet. My Lady, with
that motherly touch of the famous ironmaster night, lays her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hand
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dark hair and gently keeps it there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you, Rosa, that I wished you to be happy and that I would
make you so if I could make anybody happy on this earth. I cannot.
There are reasons now known to me, reasons in which you have no part,
rendering it far better for you that you should not remain here. You
must not remain here. I have determined that you shall not. I have
written to the father of your lover, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) will be here to-day. All
this I have done for your sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The weeping girl covers her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand with kisses and says what shall she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
do, what shall she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) do, when they are separated! Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mistress kisses
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the cheek and makes no other answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, be happy, child, under better circumstances. Be beloved and
happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my Lady, I have sometimes thought--forgive my being so
free--that YOU are not happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be more so when you have sent me away? Pray, pray, think
again. Let me stay a little while!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said, my child, that what I do, I do for your sake, not my
own. It is done. What I am towards you, Rosa, is what I am now--not
what I shall be a little while hence. Remember this, and keep my
confidence. Do so much for my sake, and thus all ends between us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) detaches herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) simple-hearted companion and leaves the
room. Late in the afternoon, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) next appears upon the
staircase, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) haughtiest and coldest state. As indifferent
as if all passion, feeling, and interest had been worn out in the
earlier ages of the world and had perished from its surface with its
other departed monsters.

<p/>Mercury has announced Mr. Rouncewell, which is the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
appearance. Mr. Rouncewell is not in the library, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) repairs to
the library. Sir Leicester is there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wishes to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester, I am desirous--but you are engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, dear no! Not at all. Only Mr. Tulkinghorn.

<p/>Always at hand. Haunting every place. No relief or security from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Lady Dedlock. Will you allow me to retire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>With a look that plainly says, <div class="bookquote">``You know you have the power to remain
if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) it is not necessary and moves towards a
chair. Mr. Tulkinghorn brings it a little forward for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
clumsy bow and retires into a window opposite. Interposed between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
and the fading light of day in the now quiet street, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) shadow falls
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) darkens all before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Even so does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) darken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
life.

<p/>It is a dull street under the best conditions, where the two long
rows of houses stare at each other with that severity that
half-a-dozen of its greatest mansions seem to have been slowly stared
into stone rather than originally built in that material. It is a
street of such dismal grandeur, so determined not to condescend to
liveliness, that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their
own in black paint and dust, and the echoing mews behind have a dry
and massive appearance, as if they were reserved to stable the stone
chargers of noble statues. Complicated garnish of iron-work entwines
itself over the flights of steps in this awful street, and from these
petrified bowers, extinguishers for obsolete flambeaux gasp at the
upstart gas. Here and there a weak little iron hoop, through which
bold boys aspire to throw their friends' caps -LRB-its only present use-RRB-,
retains its place among the rusty foliage, sacred to the memory of
departed oil. Nay, even oil itself, yet lingering at long intervals
in a little absurd glass pot, with a knob in the bottom like an
oyster, blinks and sulks at newer lights every night, like its high
and dry master in the House of Lords.

<p/>Therefore there is not much that Lady Dedlock, seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) chair,
could wish to see through the window in which Mr. Tulkinghorn stands.
And yet--and yet--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) sends a look in that direction as if it were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) heart's desire to have that figure moved out of the way.

<p/>Sir Leicester begs his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) Lady's pardon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was about to say?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that Mr. Rouncewell is here -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) has called by my appointment-RRB-
and that we had better make an end of the question of that girl. I am
tired to death of the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do--to--assist?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demands Sir Leicester in some
considerable doubt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us see him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) here and have done with it. Will you tell them to
send him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulkinghorn, be so good as to ring. Thank you. Request,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says
Sir Leicester to Mercury, not immediately remembering the business
term, <div class="bookquote">``request the iron gentleman to walk this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the iron gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mercury departs in search of the iron gentleman, finds, and produces
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Sir Leicester receives that ferruginous person graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you are well, Mr. Rouncewell. Be seated. -LRB-My solicitor, Mr.
Tulkinghorn.-RRB- My Lady was desirous, Mr. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester
skilfully transfers him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with a solemn wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``was desirous
to speak with you. Hem!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the iron gentleman</b></font>)</div>returns the iron gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``to give my best
attention to anything Lady Dedlock does me the honour to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the iron gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turns towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) finds that the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) makes upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is less agreeable than on the former occasion. A distant
supercilious air makes a cold atmosphere about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and there is
nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) bearing, as there was before, to encourage openness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>says Lady Dedlock listlessly, <div class="bookquote">``may I be allowed to
inquire whether anything has passed between you and your son
respecting your son's fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>It is almost too troublesome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) languid eyes to bestow a look
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) asks this question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my memory serves me, Lady Dedlock, I said, when I had the
pleasure of seeing you before, that I should seriously advise my son
to conquer that--fancy.''  (<font color='red'><b>ironmaster</b></font>)</div>The ironmaster repeats her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) expression with a
little emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Of course I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester gives a nod, approving and confirmatory. Very proper.
The iron gentleman, having said that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would do it, was bound to do
it. No difference in this respect between the base metals and the
precious. Highly proper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray has he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) done so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Lady Dedlock, I cannot make you a definite reply. I fear
not. Probably not yet. In our condition of life, we sometimes couple
an intention with our--our fancies which renders them not altogether
easy to throw off. I think it is rather our way to be in earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester has a misgiving that there may be a hidden Wat Tylerish
meaning in this expression, and fumes a little. Mr. Rouncewell is
perfectly good-humoured and polite, but within such limits, evidently
adapts his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) tone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) reception.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>proceeds my Lady, <div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking of the subject,
which is tiresome to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And also of what Sir Leicester said upon it, in which I quite
concur'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Sir Leicester flattered--<div class="bookquote">``and if you cannot give us the
assurance that this fancy is at an end, I have come to the conclusion
that the girl had better leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give no such assurance, Lady Dedlock. Nothing of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) had better go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, my Lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester considerately interposes, <div class="bookquote">``but
perhaps this may be doing an injury to the young woman which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
not merited. Here is a young woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester,
magnificently laying out the matter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) right hand like a
service of plate, <div class="bookquote">``whose good fortune it is to have attracted the
notice and favour of an eminent lady and to live, under the
protection of that eminent lady, surrounded by the various advantages
which such a position confers, and which are unquestionably very
great--I believe unquestionably very great, sir--for a young woman in
that station of life. The question then arises, should that young
woman be deprived of these many advantages and that good fortune
simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has'' (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div>--Sir Leicester, with an apologetic but
dignified inclination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) head towards the ironmaster, winds up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) sentence--<div class="bookquote">``has attracted the notice of Mr Rouncewell's son? Now,
has she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deserved this punishment? Is this just towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Is this
our previous understanding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>interposes Mr. Rouncewell's son's father. <div class="bookquote">``Sir
Leicester, will you allow me? I think I may shorten the subject. Pray
dismiss that from your consideration. If you remember anything so
unimportant--which is not to be expected--you would recollect that my
first thought in the affair was directly opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remaining
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Dismiss the Dedlock patronage from consideration? Oh! Sir Leicester
is bound to believe a pair of ears that have been handed down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
through such a family, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) really might have mistrusted their
report of the iron gentleman's observations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>observes my Lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) coldest manner before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) can do anything but breathe amazedly, <div class="bookquote">``to enter into these matters
on either side. The girl is a very good girl; I have nothing whatever
to say against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is so far insensible to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) many
advantages and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good fortune that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is in love--or supposes she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
is, poor little fool--and unable to appreciate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester begs to observe that wholly alters the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) might
have been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in
support of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) entirely agrees with my Lady. The young woman
had better go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As Sir Leicester observed, Mr. Rouncewell, on the last occasion when
we were fatigued by this business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Lady Dedlock languidly proceeds,
<div class="bookquote">``we cannot make conditions with you. Without conditions, and under
present circumstances, the girl is quite misplaced here and had
better go. I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so. Would you wish to have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sent back
to the village, or would you like to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with you, or what would
you prefer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, if I may speak plainly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--I should prefer the course which will the soonest relieve you of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to speak as plainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) returns with the same studied
carelessness, <div class="bookquote">``so should I. Do I understand that you will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The iron gentleman makes an iron bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester, will you ring?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn steps forward from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) window and pulls the bell. <div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten you. Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) usual bow and goes quietly back again. Mercury,
swift-responsive, appears, receives instructions whom to produce,
skims away, produces the aforesaid, and departs.

<p/>Rosa has been crying and is yet in distress. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) coming in, the
ironmaster leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) chair, takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>), and remains with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) near the door ready to depart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are taken charge of, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says my Lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) weary manner,
<div class="bookquote">``and are going away well protected. I have mentioned that you are a
very good girl, and you have nothing to cry for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seems after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>observes Mr. Tulkinghorn, loitering a little
forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were crying at going
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not well-bred, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Rouncewell with
some quickness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) manner, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) were glad to have the lawyer
to retort upon, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is an inexperienced little thing and knows
no better. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had remained here, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have improved, no
doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>is Mr. Tulkinghorn's composed reply.

<p/>Rosa sobs out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is very sorry to leave my Lady, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
was happy at Chesney Wold, and has been happy with my Lady, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) thanks my Lady over and over again. <div class="bookquote">``Out, you silly little puss!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div>says the ironmaster, checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) in a low voice, though not angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``Have a spirit, if you're fond of Watt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>My Lady merely waves her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) off
with indifference, saying, <div class="bookquote">``There, there, child! You are a good girl.
Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester has magnificently disengaged himself from the
subject and retired into the sanctuary of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) blue coat. Mr.
Tulkinghorn, an indistinct form against the dark street now dotted
with lamps, looms in my Lady's view, bigger and blacker than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Rouncewell after a pause
of a few moments, <div class="bookquote">``I beg to take my leave, with an apology for having
again troubled you, though not of my own act, on this tiresome
subject. I can very well understand, I assure you, how tiresome so
small a matter must have become to Lady Dedlock. If I am doubtful of
my dealing with it, it is only because I did not at first quietly
exert my influence to take my young friend here away without
troubling you at all. But it appeared to me--I dare say magnifying
the importance of the thing--that it was respectful to explain to you
how the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and
convenience. I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the
polite world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester considers himself evoked out of the sanctuary by these
remarks. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) returns, <div class="bookquote">``do not mention it.
Justifications are unnecessary, I hope, on either side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear it, Sir Leicester; and if I may, by way of a last
word, revert to what I said before of my mother's long connexion with
the family and the worth it bespeaks on both sides, I would point out
this little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate
and faithful in parting and in whom my mother, I dare say, has done
something to awaken such feelings--though of course Lady Dedlock, by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) heartfelt interest and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) genial condescension, has done much
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) mean this ironically, it may be truer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) thinks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) points
it, however, by no deviation from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) straightforward manner of
speech, though in saying it he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) turns towards that part of the dim
room where my Lady sits. Sir Leicester stands to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) parting
salutation, Mr. Tulkinghorn again rings, Mercury takes another
flight, and Mr. Rouncewell and Rosa leave the house.

<p/>Then lights are brought in, discovering Mr. Tulkinghorn still
standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) window with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) and my Lady still
sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) figure before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), closing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) view of the night
as well as of the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is very pale. Mr. Tulkinghorn, observing
it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) rises to retire, thinks, <div class="bookquote">``Well she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) may be! The power of
this woman is astonishing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has been acting a part the whole
time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) can act a part too--his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) one unchanging character--and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) holds the door open for this woman, fifty pairs of eyes, each
fifty times sharper than Sir Leicester's pair, should find no flaw in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>).

<p/>Lady Dedlock dines alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) own room to-day. Sir Leicester is
whipped in to the rescue of the Doodle Party and the discomfiture of
the Coodle Faction. Lady Dedlock asks on sitting down to dinner,
still deadly pale -LRB-and quite an illustration of the debilitated
cousin's text-RRB-, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is gone out? Yes. Whether Mr. Tulkinghorn
is gone yet? No. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) asks again, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) gone YET? No. What
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) doing? Mercury thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is writing letters in the library.
Would my Lady wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)? Anything but that.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) wishes to see my Lady. Within a few more minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is
reported as sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) respects, and could my Lady please to receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) for a word or two after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dinner? My Lady will receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) comes now, apologizing for intruding, even by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) permission,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is at table. When they are alone, my Lady waves her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hand to
dispense with such mockeries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer, taking a chair at a little
distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and slowly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) rusty legs up and down, up
and down, up and down, <div class="bookquote">``I am rather surprised by the course you have
taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, decidedly. I was not prepared for it. I consider it a departure
from our agreement and your promise. It puts us in a new position,
Lady Dedlock. I feel myself under the necessity of saying that I
don't approve of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) stops in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) rubbing and looks at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
knees. Imperturbable and unchangeable as he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) is, there is still an
indefinable freedom in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) manner which is new and which does not
escape this woman's observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not quite understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes you do, I think. I think you do. Come, come, Lady Dedlock,
we must not fence and parry now. You know you like this girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know--and I know--that you have not sent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away for the
reasons you have assigned, but for the purpose of separating her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as
much as possible from--excuse my mentioning it as a matter of
business--any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>returns the lawyer, crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) legs and
nursing the uppermost knee. <div class="bookquote">``I object to that. I consider that a
dangerous proceeding. I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to
awaken speculation, doubt, rumour, I don't know what, in the house.
Besides, it is a violation of our agreement. You were to be exactly
what you were before. Whereas, it must be evident to yourself, as it
is to me, that you have been this evening very different from what
you were before. Why, bless my soul, Lady Dedlock, transparently so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) begins, <div class="bookquote">``in my knowledge of my secret--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
interrupts her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Lady Dedlock, this is a matter of business, and in a matter of
business the ground cannot be kept too clear. It is no longer your
secret. Excuse me. That is just the mistake. It is my secret, in
trust for Sir Leicester and the family. If it were your secret, Lady
Dedlock, we should not be here holding this conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very true. If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can
to spare an innocent girl -LRB-especially, remembering your own reference
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when you told my story to the assembled guests at Chesney
Wold-RRB- from the taint of my impending shame, I act upon a resolution I
have taken. Nothing in the world, and no one in the world, could
shake it or could move me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says with great deliberation and
distinctness and with no more outward passion than himself. As for
him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) methodically discusses his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) matter of business as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were
any insensible instrument used in business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really? Then you see, Lady Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) returns, <div class="bookquote">``you are not to be

according to the literal fact; and that being the case, you are not
to be trusted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you may remember that I expressed some anxiety on this same
point when we spoke at night at Chesney Wold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, coolly getting up and standing on the
hearth. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. I recollect, Lady Dedlock, that you certainly referred
to the girl, but that was before we came to our arrangement, and both
the letter and the spirit of our arrangement altogether precluded any
action on your part founded upon my discovery. There can be no doubt
about that. As to sparing the girl, of what importance or value is
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Spare! Lady Dedlock, here is a family name compromised. One
might have supposed that the course was straight on--over everything,
neither to the right nor to the left, regardless of all
considerations in the way, sparing nothing, treading everything under
foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been looking at the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifts up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes and looks at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>). There is a stern expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face and a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lower
lip is compressed under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">``This woman understands me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr.

spared. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spare others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For a little while they are silent. Lady Dedlock has eaten no dinner,
but has twice or thrice poured out water with a steady hand and drunk
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) rises from table, takes a lounging-chair, and reclines in it,
shading her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) face. There is nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) manner to express weakness
or excite compassion. It is thoughtful, gloomy, concentrated. <div class="bookquote">``This
woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>thinks Mr. Tulkinghorn, standing on the hearth, again a dark

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) studies her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) leisure, not speaking for a time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) too
studies something at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) leisure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is not the first to speak,
appearing indeed so unlikely to be so, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) stood there until
midnight, that even he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is driven upon breaking silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, the most disagreeable part of this business interview

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That is all I have to trouble you

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) stops him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is moving out of the room by asking, <div class="bookquote">``This is the

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly the notice you were to receive, Lady Dedlock, because

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A home question!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a slight smile and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All things considered, I had better decline answering that question,

not believe me, and it would answer no purpose. It may be to-morrow.
I would rather say no more. You are prepared, and I hold out no
expectations which circumstances might fail to justify. I wish you
good evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) removes her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand, turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) pale face towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) walks
silently to the door, and stops him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) once again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is about to open
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you intend to remain in the house any time? I heard you were

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for my hat. I am going home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) bows her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) eyes rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) head, the movement is so slight and
curious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) withdraws. Clear of the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) looks at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) watch
but is inclined to doubt it by a minute or thereabouts. There is a
splendid clock upon the staircase, famous, as splendid clocks not
often are, for its accuracy. <div class="bookquote">``And what do YOU say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulkinghorn
inquires, referring to it. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>If it said now, <div class="bookquote">``Don't go home!''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>What a famous clock, hereafter, if
it said to-night of all the nights that it has counted off, to this
old man of all the young and old men who have ever stood before it,
<div class="bookquote">``Don't go home!''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>With its sharp clear bell it strikes three quarters
after seven and ticks on again. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you are worse than I thought
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulkinghorn/Tulkinghorn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Tulkinghorn, muttering reproof to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Two
minutes wrong? At this rate you won't last my time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What a watch to

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) passes out into the streets and walks on, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hands behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), under the shadow of the lofty houses, many of whose mysteries,
difficulties, mortgages, delicate affairs of all kinds, are treasured
up within his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) old black satin waistcoat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is in the confidence of
the very bricks and mortar. The high chimney-stacks telegraph family
secrets to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>). Yet there is not a voice in a mile of them to
whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Don't go home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>commoner</b></font>)</div><p/>Through the stir and motion of the commoner streets; through the roar
and jar of many vehicles, many feet, many voices; with the blazing
shop-lights lighting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) on, the west wind blowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) on, and the
crowd pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) is pitilessly urged upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) way, and
nothing meets him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Don't go home!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Arrived at last in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
dull room to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) candles, and look round and up, and see the
Roman pointing from the ceiling, there is no new significance in the
Roman's hand to-night or in the flutter of the attendant groups to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) the late warning, <div class="bookquote">``Don't come here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It is a moonlight night, but the moon, being past the full, is only
now rising over the great wilderness of London. The stars are shining
as they shone above the turret-leads at Chesney Wold. This woman, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) has of late been so accustomed to call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), looks out upon them.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul is turbulent within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is sick at heart and restless.
The large rooms are too cramped and close. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot endure their
restraint and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden.

<p/>Too capricious and imperious in all she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does to be the cause of much
surprise in those about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as to anything she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does, this woman,
loosely muffled, goes out into the moonlight. Mercury attends with
the key. Having opened the garden-gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) delivers the key into his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
Lady's hands at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) request and is bidden to go back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will walk
there some time to ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) aching head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) may be an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) may
be more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) needs no further escort. The gate shuts upon its spring
with a clash, and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) passing on into the dark shade of
some trees.

<p/>A fine night, and a bright large moon, and multitudes of stars. Mr.
Tulkinghorn, in repairing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) cellar and in opening and shutting
those resounding doors, has to cross a little prison-like yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
looks up casually, thinking what a fine night, what a bright large
moon, what multitudes of stars! A quiet night, too.

<p/>A very quiet night. When the moon shines very brilliantly, a solitude
and stillness seem to proceed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) that influence even crowded
places full of life. Not only is it a still night on dusty high roads
and on hill-summits, whence a wide expanse of country may be seen in
repose, quieter and quieter as it spreads away into a fringe of trees
against the sky with the grey ghost of a bloom upon them; not only is
it a still night in gardens and in woods, and on the river where the
water-meadows are fresh and green, and the stream sparkles on among
pleasant islands, murmuring weirs, and whispering rushes; not only
does the stillness attend it as it flows where houses cluster thick,
where many bridges are reflected in it, where wharves and shipping
make it black and awful, where it winds from these disfigurements
through marshes whose grim beacons stand like skeletons washed
ashore, where it expands through the bolder region of rising grounds,
rich in cornfield wind-mill and steeple, and where it mingles with
the ever-heaving sea; not only is it a still night on the deep, and
on the shore where the watcher stands to see the ship with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spread
wings cross the path of light that appears to be presented to only
him (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>); but even on this stranger's wilderness of London there is some
rest. Its steeples and towers and its one great dome grow more
ethereal; its smoky house-tops lose their grossness in the pale
effulgence; the noises that arise from the streets are fewer and are
softened, and the footsteps on the pavements pass more tranquilly
away. In these fields of Mr. Tulkinghorn's inhabiting, where the
shepherds play on Chancery pipes that have no stop, and keep their
sheep in the fold by hook and by crook until they have shorn them
exceeding close, every noise is merged, this moonlight night, into a
distant ringing hum, as if the city were a vast glass, vibrating.

<p/>What's that? Who fired a gun or pistol? Where was it?

<p/>The few foot-passengers start, stop, and stare about them. Some
windows and doors are opened, and people come out to look. It was a
loud report and echoed and rattled heavily. It shook one house, or so
a man says who was passing. It has aroused all the dogs in the
neighbourhood, who bark vehemently. Terrified cats scamper across the
road. While the dogs are yet barking and howling--there is one dog
howling like a demon--the church-clocks, as if they were startled
too, begin to strike. The hum from the streets, likewise, seems to
swell into a shout. But it is soon over. Before the last clock begins
to strike ten, there is a lull. When it has ceased, the fine night,
the bright large moon, and multitudes of stars, are left at peace
again.

<p/>Has Mr. Tulkinghorn been disturbed? His (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) windows are dark and quiet,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) door is shut. It must be something unusual indeed to bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) shell. Nothing is heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), nothing is seen of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>). What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immovable composure?

<p/>For many years the persistent Roman has been pointing, with no
particular meaning, from that ceiling. It is not likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) has
any new meaning in him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) to-night. Once pointing, always pointing--like
any Roman, or even Briton, with a single idea. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) is, no doubt,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) impossible attitude, pointing, unavailingly, all night long.
Moonlight, darkness, dawn, sunrise, day. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) is still, eagerly
pointing, and no one minds him (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>).

<p/>But a little after the coming of the day come people to clean the
rooms. And either the Roman has some new meaning in him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>), not
expressed before, or the foremost of them goes wild, for looking up
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) outstretched hand and looking down at what is below it, that
person shrieks and flies. The others, looking in as the first one
looked, shriek and fly too, and there is an alarm in the street.

<p/>What does it mean? No light is admitted into the darkened chamber,
and people unaccustomed to it enter, and treading softly but heavily,
carry a weight into the bedroom and lay it down. There is whispering
and wondering all day, strict search of every corner, careful tracing
of steps, and careful noting of the disposition of every article of
furniture. All eyes look up at the Roman, and all voices murmur, <div class="bookquote">``If
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could only tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) saw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Roman murmur</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) is pointing at a table with a bottle -LRB-nearly full of wine-RRB- and a
glass upon it and two candles that were blown out suddenly soon after
being lighted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) is pointing at an empty chair and at a stain upon
the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand. These
objects lie directly within his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) range. An excited imagination might
suppose that there was something in them so terrific as to drive the
rest of the composition, not only the attendant big-legged boys, but
the clouds and flowers and pillars too--in short, the very body and
soul of Allegory, and all the brains it has--stark mad. It happens
surely that every one who comes into the darkened room and looks at
these things looks up at the Roman and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) is invested in all
eyes with mystery and awe, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) were a paralysed dumb witness.

<p/>So it shall happen surely, through many years to come, that ghostly
stories shall be told of the stain upon the floor, so easy to be
covered, so hard to be got out, and that the Roman, pointing from the
ceiling shall point, so long as dust and damp and spiders spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>),
with far greater significance than he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) ever had in Mr. Tulkinghorn's
time, and with a deadly meaning. For Mr. Tulkinghorn's time is over
for evermore, and the Roman pointed at the murderous hand uplifted
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) life, and pointed helplessly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>), from night to
morning, lying face downward on the floor, shot through the heart.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIX

<p/>Dutiful Friendship


<p/>A great annual occasion has come round in the establishment of Mr.
Matthew Bagnet, otherwise Lignum Vitae, ex-artilleryman and present
bassoon-player. An occasion of feasting and festival. The celebration
of a birthday in the family.

<p/>It is not Mr. Bagnet's birthday. Mr. Bagnet merely distinguishes that
epoch in the musical instrument business by kissing the children with
an extra smack before breakfast, smoking an additional pipe after
dinner, and wondering towards evening what his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) poor old mother is
thinking about it--a subject of infinite speculation, and rendered so
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) mother having departed this life twenty years. Some men rarely
revert to their father, but seem, in the bank-books of their
remembrance, to have transferred all the stock of filial affection
into their mother's name. Mr. Bagnet is one of these. Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
exalted appreciation of the merits of the old girl causes him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) usually
to make the noun-substantive <div class="bookquote">``goodness''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>of the feminine gender.

<p/>It is not the birthday of one of the three children. Those occasions
are kept with some marks of distinction, but they rarely overleap the
bounds of happy returns and a pudding. On young Woolwich's last
birthday, Mr. Bagnet certainly did, after observing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) growth and
general advancement, proceed, in a moment of profound reflection on
the changes wrought by time, to examine him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) in the catechism,
accomplishing with extreme accuracy the questions number one and two,
<div class="bookquote">``What is your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Who gave you that name?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but there failing
in the exact precision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) memory and substituting for number
three the question <div class="bookquote">``And how do you like that name?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
propounded with a sense of its importance, in itself so edifying and
improving as to give it quite an orthodox air. This, however, was a
speciality on that particular birthday, and not a general solemnity.

<p/>It is the old girl's birthday, and that is the greatest holiday and
reddest-letter day in Mr. Bagnet's calendar. The auspicious event is
always commemorated according to certain forms settled and prescribed
by Mr. Bagnet some years since. Mr. Bagnet, being deeply convinced
that to have a pair of fowls for dinner is to attain the highest
pitch of imperial luxury, invariably goes forth himself very early in
the morning of this day to buy a pair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is, as invariably, taken in
by the vendor and installed in the possession of the oldest
inhabitants of any coop in Europe. Returning with these triumphs of
toughness tied up in a clean blue and white cotton handkerchief
-LRB-essential to the arrangements-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) in a casual manner invites Mrs.
Bagnet to declare at breakfast what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) would like for dinner. Mrs.
Bagnet, by a coincidence never known to fail, replying fowls, Mr.
Bagnet instantly produces his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) bundle from a place of concealment
amidst general amazement and rejoicing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) further requires that the
old girl shall do nothing all day long but sit in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very best gown
and be served by himself and the young people. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is not
illustrious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) cookery, this may be supposed to be a matter of
state rather than enjoyment on the old girl's part, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
state with all imaginable cheerfulness.

<p/>On this present birthday, Mr. Bagnet has accomplished the usual
preliminaries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) has bought two specimens of poultry, which, if
there be any truth in adages, were certainly not caught with chaff,
to be prepared for the spit; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) has amazed and rejoiced the family by
their unlooked-for production; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is himself directing the roasting
of the poultry; and Mrs. Bagnet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wholesome brown fingers
itching to prevent what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) sees going wrong, sits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) gown of
ceremony, an honoured guest.

<p/>Quebec and Malta lay the cloth for dinner, while Woolwich, serving,
as beseems him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), under his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) father, keeps the fowls revolving. To these
young scullions Mrs. Bagnet occasionally imparts a wink, or a shake
of the head, or a crooked face, as they made mistakes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At half after one.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``To the minute. They'll be
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet, with anguish, beholds one of them at a standstill before
the fire and beginning to burn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have a dinner, old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``Fit for a
queen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) white teeth cheerfully, but to the perception
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) son, betrays so much uneasiness of spirit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is impelled
by the dictates of affection to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) eyes, what is the
matter, thus standing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) eyes wide open, more oblivious of the
fowls than before, and not affording the least hope of a return to
consciousness. Fortunately his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) elder sister perceives the cause of
the agitation in Mrs. Bagnet's breast and with an admonitory poke
recalls him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>). The stopped fowls going round again, Mrs. Bagnet closes
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) eyes in the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George will look us up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``At half after four. To
the moment. How many years, old girl. Has George looked us up. This
afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Lignum, Lignum, as many as make an old woman of a young one, I
begin to think. Just about that, and no less,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returns Mrs. Bagnet,
laughing and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``never mind. You'd be as young as ever
you was. If you wasn't younger. Which you are. As everybody knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Quebec and Malta here exclaim, with clapping of hands, that Bluffy is
sure to bring mother something, and begin to speculate on what it
will be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Lignum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet, casting a glance on the
table-cloth, and winking <div class="bookquote">``salt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>at Malta with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) right eye, and
shaking the pepper away from Quebec with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) head, ``I begin to think
George is in the roving way again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``will never desert. And leave his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old
comrade. In the lurch. Don't be afraid of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lignum. No. I don't say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will. I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will. But if
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could get over this money trouble of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would be
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet asks why.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>returns his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wife, considering, <div class="bookquote">``George seems to me to be
getting not a little impatient and restless. I don't say but what
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s as free as ever. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must be free or he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wouldn't be
George, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) smarts and seems put out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s extra-drilled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``By a lawyer. Who would put
the devil out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wife assents; <div class="bookquote">``but so it is,
Lignum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Further conversation is prevented, for the time, by the necessity
under which Mr. Bagnet finds himself of directing the whole force of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) mind to the dinner, which is a little endangered by the dry
humour of the fowls in not yielding any gravy, and also by the made
gravy acquiring no flavour and turning out of a flaxen complexion.
With a similar perverseness, the potatoes crumble off forks in the
process of peeling, upheaving from their centres in every direction,
as if they were subject to earthquakes. The legs of the fowls, too,
are longer than could be desired, and extremely scaly. Overcoming
these disadvantages to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) ability, Mr. Bagnet at last
dishes and they sit down at table, Mrs. Bagnet occupying the guest's
place at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) right hand.

<p/>It is well for the old girl that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) has but one birthday in a year,
for two such indulgences in poultry might be injurious. Every kind of
finer tendon and ligament that is in the nature of poultry to possess
is developed in these specimens in the singular form of
guitar-strings. Their limbs appear to have struck roots into their
breasts and bodies, as aged trees strike roots into the earth. Their
legs are so hard as to encourage the idea that they must have devoted
the greater part of their long and arduous lives to pedestrian
exercises and the walking of matches. But Mr. Bagnet, unconscious of
these little defects, sets his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) heart on Mrs. Bagnet eating a most
severe quantity of the delicacies before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>); and as that good old
girl would not cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) a moment's disappointment on any day, least
of all on such a day, for any consideration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) imperils her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
digestion fearfully. How young Woolwich cleans the drum-sticks
without being of ostrich descent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) anxious mother is at a loss to
understand.

<p/>The old girl has another trial to undergo after the conclusion of the
repast in sitting in state to see the room cleared, the hearth swept,
and the dinner-service washed up and polished in the backyard. The
great delight and energy with which the two young ladies apply
themselves to these duties, turning up their skirts in imitation of
their mother and skating in and out on little scaffolds of pattens,
inspire the highest hopes for the future, but some anxiety for the
present. The same causes lead to confusion of tongues, a clattering
of crockery, a rattling of tin mugs, a whisking of brooms, and an
expenditure of water, all in excess, while the saturation of the
young ladies themselves is almost too moving a spectacle for Mrs.
Bagnet to look upon with the calmness proper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) position. At last
the various cleansing processes are triumphantly completed; Quebec
and Malta appear in fresh attire, smiling and dry; pipes, tobacco,
and something to drink are placed upon the table; and the old girl
enjoys the first peace of mind she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ever knows on the day of this
delightful entertainment.

<p/>When Mr. Bagnet takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) usual seat, the hands of the clock are very
near to half-past four; as they mark it accurately, Mr. Bagnet
announces, <div class="bookquote">``George! Military time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>It is George, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) has hearty congratulations for the old girl
-LRB-whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) kisses on the great occasion-RRB-, and for the children, and for
Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``Happy returns to all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, George, old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Bagnet, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) curiously.
<div class="bookquote">``What's come to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! You are so white, George--for you--and look so shocked. Now
don't he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), Lignum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``tell the old girl. What's the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know I looked white,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hand
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) brow, <div class="bookquote">``and I didn't know I looked shocked, and I'm sorry I
do. But the truth is, that boy who was taken in at my place died
yesterday afternoon, and it has rather knocked me over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor creetur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet with a mother's pity. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gone?
Dear, dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to say anything about it, for it's not birthday talk,
but you have got it out of me, you see, before I sit down. I should
have roused up in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, making himself speak
more gaily, <div class="bookquote">``but you're so quick, Mrs. Bagnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right. The old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``Is as quick. As
powder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's more, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s the subject of the day, and we'll stick to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``See here, I have brought a little brooch
along with me. It's a poor thing, you know, but it's a keepsake.
That's all the good it is, Mrs. Bagnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George produces his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) present, which is greeted with admiring
leapings and clappings by the young family, and with a species of
reverential admiration by Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``Old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) my opinion of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's a wonder, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bagnet exclaims. <div class="bookquote">``It's the
beautifullest thing that ever was seen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``My opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so pretty, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Bagnet, turning it on all sides
and holding it out at arm's length, <div class="bookquote">``that it seems too choice for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``Not my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But whatever it is, a hundred thousand thanks, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says
Mrs. Bagnet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) eyes sparkling with pleasure and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hand stretched
out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and though I have been a crossgrained soldier's wife to
you sometimes, George, we are as strong friends, I am sure, in
reality, as ever can be. Now you shall fasten it on yourself, for
good luck, if you will, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The children close up to see it done, and Mr. Bagnet looks over young
Woolwich's head to see it done with an interest so maturely wooden,
yet pleasantly childish, that Mrs. Bagnet cannot help laughing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
airy way and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lignum, Lignum, what a precious old chap
you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>But the trooper fails to fasten the brooch. His (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) hand
shakes, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is nervous, and it falls off. <div class="bookquote">``Would any one believe
this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), catching it as it drops and looking round. <div class="bookquote">``I am so
out of sorts that I bungle at an easy job like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet concludes that for such a case there is no remedy like a
pipe, and fastening the brooch herself in a twinkling, causes the
trooper to be inducted into his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) usual snug place and the pipes to be
got into action. <div class="bookquote">``If that don't bring you round, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``just throw your eye across here at your present now and then, and
the two together MUST do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to do it of yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>George answers; ``I know that very
well, Mrs. Bagnet. I'll tell you how, one way and another, the blues
have got to be too many for me. Here was this poor lad. <div class="bookquote">``Twas dull
work to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) dying as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) did, and not be able to help him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, George? You did help him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). You took him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) under your
roof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I helped him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so far, but that's little. I mean, Mrs. Bagnet, there
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was, dying without ever having been taught much more than to know
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) right hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left. And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was too far gone to be helped
out of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor creetur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, not yet lighting his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) pipe, and passing his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
heavy hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) hair, <div class="bookquote">``that brought up Gridley in a man's mind.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) was a bad case too, in a different way. Then the two got mixed up
in a man's mind with a flinty old rascal who had to do with both. And
to think of that rusty carbine, stock and barrel, standing up on end
in his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) corner, hard, indifferent, taking everything so evenly--it
made flesh and blood tingle, I do assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My advice to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returns Mrs. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``is to light your pipe and
tingle that way. It's wholesomer and comfortabler, and better for the
health altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) does it, though still with an indignant gravity that impresses
the young Bagnets, and even causes Mr. Bagnet to defer the ceremony
of drinking Mrs. Bagnet's health, always given by himself on these
occasions in a speech of exemplary terseness. But the young ladies
having composed what Mr. Bagnet is in the habit of calling <div class="bookquote">``the
mixtur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>and George's pipe being now in a glow, Mr. Bagnet considers
it his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) duty to proceed to the toast of the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) addresses the
assembled company in the following terms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George. Woolwich. Quebec. Malta. This is her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) birthday. Take a day's
march. And you won't find such another. Here's towards her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>The toast having been drunk with enthusiasm, Mrs. Bagnet returns
thanks in a neat address of corresponding brevity. This model
composition is limited to the three words <div class="bookquote">``And wishing yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>which
the old girl follows up with a nod at everybody in succession and a
well-regulated swig of the mixture. This she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again follows up, on the
present occasion, by the wholly unexpected exclamation, <div class="bookquote">``Here's a
man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here IS a man, much to the astonishment of the little company,
looking in at the parlour-door. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a sharp-eyed man--a quick keen
man--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes in everybody's look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), all at once,
individually and collectively, in a manner that stamps him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
remarkable man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man nodding</b></font>)</div>says the man, nodding, <div class="bookquote">``how do you find yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man nodding</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's Bucket!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the man, coming in and closing the door. <div class="bookquote">``I was going
down the street here when I happened to stop and look in at the
musical instruments in the shop-window--a friend of mine is in want
of a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone--and I saw a party
enjoying themselves, and I thought it was you in the corner; I
thought I couldn't be mistaken. How goes the world with you, George,
at the present moment? Pretty smooth? And with you, ma'am? And with
you, governor? And Lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arms, <div class="bookquote">``here's
children too! You may do anything with me if you only show me
children. Give us a kiss, my pets. No occasion to inquire who YOUR
father and mother is. Never saw such a likeness in my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket, not unwelcome, has sat himself down next to Mr. George
and taken Quebec and Malta on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``You pretty dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``give us another kiss; it's the only thing I'm greedy in.
Lord bless you, how healthy you look! And what may be the ages of
these two, ma'am? I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight
and ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very near, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Bagnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I generally am near,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``being so fond of
children. A friend of mine has had nineteen of 'em, ma'am, all by one
mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s still as fresh and rosy as the morning. Not so much
so as yourself, but, upon my soul, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) comes near you! And what do
you call these, my darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>pursues Mr. Bucket, pinching Malta's
cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``These are peaches, these are. Bless your heart! And what do
you think about father? Do you think father could recommend a
second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket's friend, my
dear? My name's Bucket. Ain't that a funny name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>These blandishments have entirely won the family heart. Mrs. Bagnet
forgets the day to the extent of filling a pipe and a glass for Mr.
Bucket and waiting upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hospitably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) would be glad to receive
so pleasant a character under any circumstances, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
that as a friend of George's she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is particularly glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) this
evening, for George has not been in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) usual spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) usual spirits?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>exclaims Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I never heard
of such a thing! What's the matter, George? You don't intend to tell
me you've been out of spirits. What should you be out of spirits for?
You haven't got anything on your mind, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>rejoins Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``What could you have on
your mind, you know! And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds,
eh? Not they, but they'll be upon the minds of some of the young
fellows, some of these days, and make 'em precious low-spirited. I
ain't much of a prophet, but I can tell you that, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet, quite charmed, hopes Mr. Bucket has a family of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, ma'am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it? No, I
haven't. My wife and a lodger constitute my family. Mrs. Bucket is as
fond of children as myself and as wishful to have 'em, but no. So it
is. Worldly goods are divided unequally, and man must not repine.
What a very nice backyard, ma'am! Any way out of that yard, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no way out of that yard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't there really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``I should have thought there
might have been. Well, I don't know as I ever saw a backyard that
took my fancy more. Would you allow me to look at it? Thank you. No,
I see there's no way out. But what a very good-proportioned yard it
is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Having cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sharp eye all about it, Mr. Bucket returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
chair next his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) friend Mr. George and pats Mr. George affectionately
on the shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are your spirits now, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's your sort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Why should you ever have been
otherwise? A man of your fine figure and constitution has no right to
be out of spirits. That ain't a chest to be out of spirits, is it,
ma'am? And you haven't got anything on your mind, you know, George;
what could you have on your mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Somewhat harping on this phrase, considering the extent and variety
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) conversational powers, Mr. Bucket twice or thrice repeats it
to the pipe he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) lights, and with a listening face that is particularly
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own. But the sun of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sociality soon recovers from this brief
eclipse and shines again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is brother, is it, my dears?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, referring to
Quebec and Malta for information on the subject of young Woolwich.
<div class="bookquote">``And a nice brother he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is--half-brother I mean to say. For he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s too
old to be your boy, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can certify at all events that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is not anybody else's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returns
Mrs. Bagnet, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you do surprise me! Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s like you, there's no denying.
Lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s wonderfully like you! But about what you may call the
brow, you know, THERE his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father comes out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket compares the
faces with one eye shut up, while Mr. Bagnet smokes in stolid
satisfaction.

<p/>This is an opportunity for Mrs. Bagnet to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) that the boy is
George's godson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George's godson, is he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>rejoins Mr. Bucket with extreme cordiality.
<div class="bookquote">``I must shake hands over again with George's godson. Godfather and
godson do credit to one another. And what do you intend to make of
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), ma'am? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) show any turn for any musical instrument?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet suddenly interposes, <div class="bookquote">``Plays the fife. Beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it, governor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, struck by the
coincidence, ``that when I was a boy I played the fife myself? Not in
a scientific way, as I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does, but by ear. Lord bless you!
``British Grenadiers'--there's a tune to warm an Englishman up! COULD
you give us <div class="bookquote">``British Grenadiers,''  (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div>my fine fellow?''

<p/>Nothing could be more acceptable to the little circle than this call
upon young Woolwich, who immediately fetches his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fife and performs
the stirring melody, during which performance Mr. Bucket, much
enlivened, beats time and never fails to come in sharp with the
burden, <div class="bookquote">``British Gra-a-anadeers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shows so much musical
taste that Mr. Bagnet actually takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) lips to
express his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) is a singer. Mr. Bucket receives the
harmonious impeachment so modestly, confessing how that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) did once
chaunt a little, for the expression of the feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own bosom,
and with no presumptuous idea of entertaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) friends, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is
asked to sing. Not to be behindhand in the sociality of the evening,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) complies and gives them <div class="bookquote">``Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young
Charms.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This ballad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) informs Mrs. Bagnet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) considers to have
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) most powerful ally in moving the heart of Mrs. Bucket when a
maiden, and inducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) to approach the altar--Mr. Bucket's own
words are <div class="bookquote">``to come up to the scratch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>This sparkling stranger is such a new and agreeable feature in the
evening that Mr. George, who testified no great emotions of pleasure
on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) entrance, begins, in spite of himself, to be rather proud of
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is so friendly, is a man of so many resources, and so easy to
get on with, that it is something to have made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) known there. Mr.
Bagnet becomes, after another pipe, so sensible of the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
acquaintance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) solicits the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) company on the old
girl's next birthday. If anything can more closely cement and
consolidate the esteem which Mr. Bucket has formed for the family, it
is the discovery of the nature of the occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) drinks to Mrs.
Bagnet with a warmth approaching to rapture, engages himself for that
day twelvemonth more than thankfully, makes a memorandum of the day
in a large black pocket-book with a girdle to it, and breathes a hope
that Mrs. Bucket and Mrs. Bagnet may before then become, in a manner,
sisters. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) says himself, what is public life without private
ties? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) humble way a public man, but it is not in that
sphere that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) finds happiness. No, it must be sought within the
confines of domestic bliss.

<p/>It is natural, under these circumstances, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turn,
should remember the friend to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is indebted for so promising an
acquaintance. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) keeps very close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Whatever the
subject of the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) keeps a tender eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) waits
to walk home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) very boots and
observes even them attentively as Mr. George sits smoking
cross-legged in the chimney-corner.

<p/>At length Mr. George rises to depart. At the same moment Mr. Bucket,
with the secret sympathy of friendship, also rises. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) dotes upon the
children to the last and remembers the commission he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has undertaken
for an absent friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Respecting that second-hand wiolinceller, governor--could you
recommend me such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scores,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bagnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``You're a friend in need. A good tone, mind you! My friend is a
regular dab at it. Ecod, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saws away at Mozart and Handel and the
rest of the big-wigs like a thorough workman. And you needn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says
Mr. Bucket in a considerate and private voice, <div class="bookquote">``you needn't commit
yourself to too low a figure, governor. I don't want to pay too large
a price for my friend, but I want you to have your proper percentage
and be remunerated for your loss of time. That is but fair. Every man
must live, and ought to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) head at the old girl to the effect that they
have found a jewel of price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I was to give you a look in, say, at half arter ten
to-morrow morning. Perhaps you could name the figures of a few
wiolincellers of a good tone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.

<p/>Nothing easier. Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet both engage to have the requisite
information ready and even hint to each other at the practicability
of having a small stock collected there for approval.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``thank you. Good night, ma'am. Good
night, governor. Good night, darlings. I am much obliged to you for
one of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>They, on the contrary, are much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) for the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
has given them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) company; and so they part with many expressions
of goodwill on both sides. <div class="bookquote">``Now George, old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket,
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) arm at the shop-door, <div class="bookquote">``come along!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>As they go down the
little street and the Bagnets pause for a minute looking after them,
Mrs. Bagnet remarks to the worthy Lignum that Mr. Bucket <div class="bookquote">``almost
clings to George like, and seems to be really fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>The neighbouring streets being narrow and ill-paved, it is a little
inconvenient to walk there two abreast and arm in arm. Mr. George
therefore soon proposes to walk singly. But Mr. Bucket, who cannot
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mind to relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) friendly hold, replies, <div class="bookquote">``Wait half
a minute, George. I should wish to speak to you first.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Immediately
afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) twists him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) into a public-house and into a parlour,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and claps his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own back against the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``duty is duty, and friendship is
friendship. I never want the two to clash if I can help it. I have
endeavoured to make things pleasant to-night, and I put it to you
whether I have done it or not. You must consider yourself in custody,
George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Custody? What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper thunderstruck</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper, thunderstruck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, urging a sensible view of the case
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fat forefinger, <div class="bookquote">``duty, as you know very well, is
one thing, and conversation is another. It's my duty to inform you
that any observations you may make will be liable to be used against
you. Therefore, George, be careful what you say. You don't happen to
have heard of a murder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Murder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) forefinger in an
impressive state of action, <div class="bookquote">``bear in mind what I've said to you. I
ask you nothing. You've been in low spirits this afternoon. I say,
you don't happen to have heard of a murder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Where has there been a murder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``don't you go and commit yourself.
I'm a-going to tell you what I want you for. There has been a murder
in Lincoln's Inn Fields--gentleman of the name of Tulkinghorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) was
shot last night. I want you for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper sinks upon a seat behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), and great drops start out
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) forehead, and a deadly pallor overspreads his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bucket! It's not possible that Mr. Tulkinghorn has been killed and
that you suspect ME?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) forefinger going, <div class="bookquote">``it is
certainly possible, because it's the case. This deed was done last
night at ten o'clock. Now, you know where you were last night at ten
o'clock, and you'll be able to prove it, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Last night! Last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>repeats the trooper</b></font>)</div>repeats the trooper thoughtfully. Then it
flashes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why, great heaven, I was there last night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I have understood, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket with great
deliberation. <div class="bookquote">``So I have understood. Likewise you've been very often
there. You've been seen hanging about the place, and you've been
heard more than once in a wrangle with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and it's possible--I
don't say it's certainly so, mind you, but it's possible--that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) may
have been heard to call you a threatening, murdering, dangerous
fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper gasps as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would admit it all if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>continues Mr. Bucket, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hat upon the table
with an air of business rather in the upholstery way than otherwise,
<div class="bookquote">``my wish is, as it has been all the evening, to make things pleasant.
I tell you plainly there's a reward out, of a hundred guineas,
offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet. You and me have always
been pleasant together; but I have got a duty to discharge; and if
that hundred guineas is to be made, it may as well be made by me as
any other man. On all of which accounts, I should hope it was clear
to you that I must have you, and that I'm damned if I don't have you.
Am I to call in any assistance, or is the trick done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George has recovered himself and stands up like a soldier.
<div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``I am ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>continues Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``wait a bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) upholsterer
manner, as if the trooper were a window to be fitted up, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) takes
from his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) pocket a pair of handcuffs. <div class="bookquote">``This is a serious charge,
George, and such is my duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper flushes angrily and hesitates a moment, but holds out his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
two hands, clasped together, and says, <div class="bookquote">``There! Put them on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket adjusts them in a moment. <div class="bookquote">``How do you find them? Are they
comfortable? If not, say so, for I wish to make things as pleasant as
is consistent with my duty, and I've got another pair in my pocket.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) offers like a most respectable tradesman anxious to
execute an order neatly and to the perfect satisfaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
customer. <div class="bookquote">``They'll do as they are? Very well! Now, you see,
George'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) takes a cloak from a corner and begins adjusting it about
the trooper's neck--<div class="bookquote">``I was mindful of your feelings when I come out,
and brought this on purpose. There! Who's the wiser?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper, <div class="bookquote">``but as I know it, do me one more good
turn and pull my hat over my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, though! Do you mean it? Ain't it a pity? It looks so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't look chance men in the face with these things on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr.
George hurriedly replies. <div class="bookquote">``Do, for God's sake, pull my hat forward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>So strongly entreated, Mr. Bucket complies, puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own hat on, and
conducts his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) prize into the streets, the trooper marching on as
steadily as usual, though with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head less erect, and Mr. Bucket
steering him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) elbow over the crossings and up the turnings.




<p/>CHAPTER L

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>It happened that when I came home from Deal I found a note from Caddy
Jellyby -LRB-as we always continued to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)-RRB-, informing me that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
health, which had been for some time very delicate, was worse and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) would be more glad than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) could tell me if I would go to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>). It was a note of a few lines, written from the couch on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) lay and enclosed to me in another from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) husband, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seconded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) entreaty with much solicitude. Caddy was now
the mother, and I the godmother, of such a poor little baby--such a
tiny old-faced mite, with a countenance that seemed to be scarcely
anything but cap-border, and a little lean, long-fingered hand,
always clenched under its chin. It would lie in this attitude all
day, with its bright specks of eyes open, wondering -LRB-as I used to
imagine-RRB- how it came to be so small and weak. Whenever it was moved
it cried, but at all other times it was so patient that the sole
desire of its life appeared to be to lie quiet and think. It had
curious little dark veins in its face and curious little dark marks
under its eyes like faint remembrances of poor Caddy's inky days, and
altogether, to those who were not used to it, it was quite a piteous
little sight.

<p/>But it was enough for Caddy that SHE was used to it. The projects
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) beguiled her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) illness, for little Esther's education,
and little Esther's marriage, and even for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) own old age as the
grandmother of little Esther's little Esthers, was so prettily
expressive of devotion to this pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life that I should be
tempted to recall some of them but for the timely remembrance that I
am getting on irregularly as it is.

<p/>To return to the letter. Caddy had a superstition about me which had
been strengthening in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mind ever since that night long ago when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had lain asleep with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head in my lap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) almost--I think I
must say quite--believed that I did her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) good whenever I was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>).
Now although this was such a fancy of the affectionate girl's that I
am almost ashamed to mention it, still it might have all the force of
a fact when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was really ill. Therefore I set off to Caddy, with my
guardian's consent, post-haste; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and Prince made so much of me
that there never was anything like it.

<p/>Next day I went again to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and next day I went again. It
was a very easy journey, for I had only to rise a little earlier in
the morning, and keep my accounts, and attend to housekeeping matters
before leaving home.

<p/>But when I had made these three visits, my guardian said to me, on my
return at night, <div class="bookquote">``Now, little woman, little woman, this will never
do. Constant dropping will wear away a stone, and constant coaching
will wear out a Dame Durden. We will go to London for a while and
take possession of our old lodgings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for me, dear guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``for I never feel tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which
was strictly true. I was only too happy to be in such request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For me then,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``or for Ada, or for both of us.
It is somebody's birthday to-morrow, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly I think it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, kissing my darling, who would be
twenty-one to-morrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian, half pleasantly, half seriously,
<div class="bookquote">``that's a great occasion and will give my fair cousin some necessary
business to transact in assertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) independence, and will make
London a more convenient place for all of us. So to London we will
go. That being settled, there is another thing--how have you left
Caddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very unwell, guardian. I fear it will be some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
regains her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) health and strength.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call some time, now?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>asked my guardian thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some weeks, I am afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) began to walk about the room with his (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) pockets,
showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) had been thinking as much. <div class="bookquote">``Now, what do you say
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) doctor? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a good doctor, my love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt obliged to confess that I knew nothing to the contrary but
that Prince and I had agreed only that evening that we would like his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
opinion to be confirmed by some one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian quickly, <div class="bookquote">``there's Woodcourt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>I had not meant that, and was rather taken by surprise. For a moment
all that I had had in my mind in connexion with Mr. Woodcourt seemed
to come back and confuse me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't object to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), little woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Object to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), guardian? Oh no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't think the patient would object to him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>So far from that, I had no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) being prepared to have a
great reliance on him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) and to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) very much. I said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was
no stranger to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) personally, for she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) often in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) kind
attendance on Miss Flite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) has been here to-day, my dear, and
I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) about it to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt in this short conversation--though I did not know how, for she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
was quiet, and we interchanged no look--that my dear girl well
remembered how merrily she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had clasped me round the waist when no
other hands than Caddy's had brought me the little parting token.
This caused me to feel that I ought to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and Caddy too, that
I was going to be the mistress of Bleak House and that if I avoided
that disclosure any longer I might become less worthy in my own eyes
of its master's love. Therefore, when we went upstairs and had waited
listening until the clock struck twelve in order that only I might be
the first to wish my darling all good wishes on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) birthday and to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to my heart, I set before her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), just as I had set before
myself, the goodness and honour of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cousin John and the happy life
that was in store for me. If ever my darling were fonder of me at
one time than another in all our intercourse, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was surely fondest
of me that night. And I was so rejoiced to know it and so comforted
by the sense of having done right in casting this last idle
reservation away that I was ten times happier than I had been before.
I had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago, but now that
it was gone I felt as if I understood its nature better.

<p/>Next day we went to London. We found our old lodging vacant, and in
half an hour were quietly established there, as if we had never gone
away. Mr. Woodcourt dined with us to celebrate my darling's birthday,
and we were as pleasant as we could be with the great blank among us
that Richard's absence naturally made on such an occasion. After that
day I was for some weeks--eight or nine as I remember--very much with
Caddy, and thus it fell out that I saw less of Ada at this time than
any other since we had first come together, except the time of my own
illness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) often came to Caddy's, but our function there was to
amuse and cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), and we did not talk in our usual confidential
manner. Whenever I went home at night we were together, but Caddy's
rest was broken by pain, and I often remained to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).

<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) poor little mite of a baby to love and their
home to strive for, what a good creature Caddy was! So self-denying,
so uncomplaining, so anxious to get well on their account, so afraid
of giving trouble, and so thoughtful of the unassisted labours of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
husband and the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop; I had never known the
best of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) until now. And it seemed so curious that her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) pale face
and helpless figure should be lying there day after day where dancing
was the business of life, where the kit and the apprentices began
early every morning in the ball-room, and where the untidy little boy
waltzed by himself in the kitchen all the afternoon.

<p/>At Caddy's request I took the supreme direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) apartment,
trimmed it up, and pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), couch and all, into a lighter and more
airy and more cheerful corner than she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had yet occupied; then, every
day, when we were in our neatest array, I used to lay my small small
namesake in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) arms and sit down to chat or work or read to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). It
was at one of the first of these quiet times that I told Caddy about
Bleak House.

<p/>We had other visitors besides Ada. First of all we had Prince, who in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hurried intervals of teaching used to come softly in and sit
softly down, with a face of loving anxiety for Caddy and the very
little child. Whatever Caddy's condition really was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) never failed
to declare to Prince that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was all but well--which I, heaven
forgive me, never failed to confirm. This would put Prince in such
good spirits that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would sometimes take the kit from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pocket and
play a chord or two to astonish the baby, which I never knew it to do
in the least degree, for my tiny namesake never noticed it at all.

<p/>Then there was Mrs. Jellyby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) would come occasionally, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
usual distraught manner, and sit calmly looking miles beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>)
grandchild as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) attention were absorbed by a young Borrioboolan
on its native shores. As bright-eyed as ever, as serene, and as
untidy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Caddy, child, and how do you do
to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then would sit amiably smiling and taking no notice of
the reply or would sweetly glide off into a calculation of the number
of letters she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had lately received and answered or of the
coffee-bearing power of Borrioboola-Gha. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) would always do
with a serene contempt for our limited sphere of action, not to be
disguised.

<p/>Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop, who was from morning to night and
from night to morning the subject of innumerable precautions. If the
baby cried, it was nearly stifled lest the noise should make him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>)
uncomfortable. If the fire wanted stirring in the night, it was
surreptitiously done lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) rest should be broken. If Caddy
required any little comfort that the house contained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) first
carefully discussed whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) was likely to require it too. In
return for this consideration he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) would come into the room once a day,
all but blessing it--showing a condescension, and a patronage, and a
grace of manner in dispensing the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) high-shouldered
presence from which I might have supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) -LRB-if I had not known
better-RRB- to have been the benefactor of Caddy's life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Caroline,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) would say, making the nearest approach that he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>)
could to bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tell me that you are better to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, much better, thank you, Mr. Turveydrop,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Caddy would reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted! Enchanted! And our dear Miss Summerson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) is not quite
prostrated by fatigue?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) would crease up his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) eyelids and kiss
his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) fingers to me, though I am happy to say he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) had ceased to be
particular in his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) attentions since I had been so altered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would assure him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charming! We must take care of our dear Caroline, Miss Summerson. We
must spare nothing that will restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>). We must nourish her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>). My
dear Caroline'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) would turn to his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) daughter-in-law with infinite
generosity and protection--<div class="bookquote">``want for nothing, my love. Frame a wish
and gratify it, my daughter. Everything this house contains,
everything my room contains, is at your service, my dear. Do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>)
would sometimes add in a burst of deportment, <div class="bookquote">``even allow my simple
requirements to be considered if they should at any time interfere
with your own, my Caroline. Your necessities are greater than mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) had established such a long prescriptive right to this deportment
-LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) son's inheritance from his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) mother-RRB- that I several times knew
both Caddy and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband to be melted to tears by these
affectionate self-sacrifices.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) would remonstrate; and when I saw Caddy's thin
arm about his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) fat neck as he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) said it, I would be melted too, though
not by the same process. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay! I have promised never to leave
ye. Be dutiful and affectionate towards me, and I ask no other
return. Now, bless ye! I am going to the Park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) would take the air there presently and get an appetite for his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>)
hotel dinner. I hope I do old Mr. Turveydrop no wrong, but I never
saw any better traits in him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) than these I faithfully record, except
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) certainly conceived a liking for Peepy and would take the
child out walking with great pomp, always on those occasions sending
him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) home before he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) went to dinner himself, and occasionally with a
halfpenny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) pocket. But even this disinterestedness was attended
with no inconsiderable cost, to my knowledge, for before Peepy was
sufficiently decorated to walk hand in hand with the professor of
deportment, he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) had to be newly dressed, at the expense of Caddy and
her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) husband, from top to toe.

<p/>Last of our visitors, there was Mr. Jellyby. Really when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) used to
come in of an evening, and ask Caddy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) meek voice how she (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) was,
and then sit down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head against the wall, and make no attempt
to say anything more, I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) very much. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) found me bustling
about doing any little thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) sometimes half took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) coat off, as
if with an intention of helping by a great exertion; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) never got
any further. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) sole occupation was to sit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head against the
wall, looking hard at the thoughtful baby; and I could not quite
divest my mind of a fancy that they understood one another.

<p/>I have not counted Mr. Woodcourt among our visitors because he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was
now Caddy's regular attendant. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) soon began to improve under his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
care, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was so gentle, so skilful, so unwearying in the pains he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
took that it is not to be wondered at, I am sure. I saw a good deal
of Mr. Woodcourt during this time, though not so much as might be
supposed, for knowing Caddy to be safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) hands, I often slipped
home at about the hours when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was expected. We frequently met,
notwithstanding. I was quite reconciled to myself now, but I still
felt glad to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was sorry for me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) still WAS sorry
for me I believed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) helped Mr. Badger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) professional
engagements, which were numerous, and had as yet no settled projects
for the future.

<p/>It was when Caddy began to recover that I began to notice a change in
my dear girl. I cannot say how it first presented itself to me,
because I observed it in many slight particulars which were nothing
in themselves and only became something when they were pieced
together. But I made it out, by putting them together, that Ada was
not so frankly cheerful with me as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) used to be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) tenderness for
me was as loving and true as ever; I did not for a moment doubt that;
but there was a quiet sorrow about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) did not confide to
me, and in which I traced some hidden regret.

<p/>Now, I could not understand this, and I was so anxious for the
happiness of my own pet that it caused me some uneasiness and set me
thinking often. At length, feeling sure that Ada suppressed this
something from me lest it should make me unhappy too, it came into my
head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was a little grieved--for me--by what I had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
about Bleak House.

<p/>How I persuaded myself that this was likely, I don't know. I had no
idea that there was any selfish reference in my doing so. I was not
grieved for myself: I was quite contented and quite happy. Still,
that Ada might be thinking--for me, though I had abandoned all such
thoughts--of what once was, but was now all changed, seemed so easy
to believe that I believed it.

<p/>What could I do to reassure my darling -LRB-I considered then-RRB- and show
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) that I had no such feelings? Well! I could only be as brisk and
busy as possible, and that I had tried to be all along. However, as
Caddy's illness had certainly interfered, more or less, with my home
duties--though I had always been there in the morning to make my
guardian's breakfast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) had a hundred times laughed and said
there must be two little women, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) little woman was never
missing--I resolved to be doubly diligent and gay. So I went about
the house humming all the tunes I knew, and I sat working and working
in a desperate manner, and I talked and talked, morning, noon, and
night.

<p/>And still there was the same shade between me and my darling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Dame Trot,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian, shutting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) book one night
when we were all three together, <div class="bookquote">``so Woodcourt has restored Caddy
Jellyby to the full enjoyment of life again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; <div class="bookquote">``and to be repaid by such gratitude as hers is to be
made rich, guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So did I too, for that matter. I said so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! We would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) as rich as a Jew if we knew how. Would we
not, little woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I laughed as I worked and replied that I was not sure about that, for
it might spoil him (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) might not be so useful, and there might be
many who could ill spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>). As Miss Flite, and Caddy herself, and
many others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten that. But we would agree
to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) rich enough to live, I suppose? Rich enough to work with
tolerable peace of mind? Rich enough to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) own happy home and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) own household gods--and household goddess, too, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>That was quite another thing, I said. We must all agree in that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``All of us. I have a great regard for
Woodcourt, a high esteem for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>); and I have been sounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>)
delicately about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) plans. It is difficult to offer aid to an
independent man with that just kind of pride which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) possesses. And
yet I would be glad to do it if I might or if I knew how. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) seems
half inclined for another voyage. But that appears like casting such
a man away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might open a new world to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it might, little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>my guardian assented. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
expects much of the old world. Do you know I have fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sometimes feels some particular disappointment or misfortune
encountered in it. You never heard of anything of that sort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I shook my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``I am mistaken, I dare say.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As there was
a little pause here, which I thought, for my dear girl's
satisfaction, had better be filled up, I hummed an air as I worked
which was a favourite with my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you think Mr. Woodcourt will make another voyage?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) when I had hummed it quietly all through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know what to think, my dear, but I should say it was
likely at present that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) will give a long trip to another country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) will take the best wishes of all our hearts with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``and though they are not riches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) will
never be the poorer for them, guardian, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caddy</b></font>) replied.

<p/>I was sitting in my usual place, which was now beside my guardian's
chair. That had not been my usual place before the letter, but it was
now. I looked up to Ada, who was sitting opposite, and I saw, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
looked at me, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) eyes were filled with tears and that tears
were falling down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face. I felt that I had only to be placid and
merry once for all to undeceive my dear and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) loving heart at
rest. I really was so, and I had nothing to do but to be myself.

<p/>So I made my sweet girl lean upon my shoulder--how little thinking
what was heavy on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind!--and I said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not quite well, and
put my arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) upstairs. When we were in our own
room, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might perhaps have told me what I was so
unprepared to hear, I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) no encouragement to confide in me; I
never thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood in need of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear good Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, <div class="bookquote">``if I could only make up my mind
to speak to you and my cousin John when you are together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my love!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated. <div class="bookquote">``Ada, why should you not speak to
us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada only dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head and pressed me closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You surely don't forget, my beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``what quiet,
old-fashioned people we are and how I have settled down to be the
discreetest of dames? You don't forget how happily and peacefully my
life is all marked out for me, and by whom? I am certain that you
don't forget by what a noble character, Ada. That can never be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, never, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why then, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``there can be nothing amiss--and why
should you not speak to us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing amiss, Esther?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>returned Ada. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, when I think of all these
years, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) fatherly care and kindness, and of the old
relations among us, and of you, what shall I do, what shall I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked at my child in some wonder, but I thought it better not to
answer otherwise than by cheering her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), and so I turned off into many
little recollections of our life together and prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) from
saying more. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lay down to sleep, and not before, I returned
to my guardian to say good night, and then I came back to Ada and sat
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) for a little while.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was asleep, and I thought as I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was a
little changed. I had thought so more than once lately. I could not
decide, even looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was unconscious, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was
changed, but something in the familiar beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face looked
different to me. My guardian's old hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and Richard arose
sorrowfully in my mind, and I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) has been anxious
about him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I wondered how that love would end.

<p/>When I had come home from Caddy's while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was ill, I had often
found Ada at work, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had always put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) work away, and I had
never known what it was. Some of it now lay in a drawer near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>),
which was not quite closed. I did not open the drawer, but I still
rather wondered what the work could be, for it was evidently nothing
for herself.

<p/>And I noticed as I kissed my dear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lay with one hand under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) pillow so that it was hidden.

<p/>How much less amiable I must have been than they thought me, how much
less amiable than I thought myself, to be so preoccupied with my own
cheerfulness and contentment as to think that it only rested with me
to put my dear girl right and set her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind at peace!

<p/>But I lay down, self-deceived, in that belief. And I awoke in it next
day to find that there was still the same shade between me and my
darling.




<p/>CHAPTER LI

<p/>Enlightened


<p/>When Mr. Woodcourt arrived in London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) went, that very same day, to
Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Symond</b></font>) never once, from the moment when
I entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Symond</b></font>) to be a friend to Richard, neglected or forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
promise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) accepted the charge as a sacred
trust, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was ever true to it in that spirit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) found Mr. Vholes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) office and informed Mr. Vholes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
agreement with Richard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) should call there to learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
address.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes. ``Mr. C.``s address is not a hundred
miles from here, sir, Mr. C.<div class="bookquote">``s address is not a hundred miles from
here. Would you take a seat, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. C.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodcourt thanked Mr. Vholes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had no business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
beyond what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had mentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, sir. I believe, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, still quietly
insisting on the seat by not giving the address, <div class="bookquote">``that you have
influence with Mr. C. Indeed I am aware that you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not aware of it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Woodcourt; <div class="bookquote">``but I
suppose you know best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Vholes, self-contained as usual, voice and all,
<div class="bookquote">``it is a part of my professional duty to know best. It is a part of
my professional duty to study and to understand a gentleman who
confides his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) interests to me. In my professional duty I shall not be
wanting, sir, if I know it. I may, with the best intentions, be
wanting in it without knowing it; but not if I know it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodcourt again mentioned the address.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me leave, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes. <div class="bookquote">``Bear with me for a moment.
Sir, Mr. C. is playing for a considerable stake, and cannot play
without--need I say what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, ``to be honest with you -LRB-honesty being my
golden rule, whether I gain by it or lose, and I find that I
generally lose-RRB-, money is the word. Now, sir, upon the chances of Mr.
C.``s game I express to you no opinion, NO opinion. It might be highly
impolitic in Mr. C., after playing so long and so high, to leave off;
it might be the reverse; I say nothing. No, sir,'' said Mr. Vholes,
bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) hand flat down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) desk in a positive manner,
<div class="bookquote">``nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Woodcourt, <div class="bookquote">``that I ask you to say
nothing and have no interest in anything you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Vholes. <div class="bookquote">``You do yourself an injustice.
No, sir! Pardon me! You shall not--shall not in my office, if I know
it--do yourself an injustice. You are interested in anything, and in
everything, that relates to your friend. I know human nature much
better, sir, than to admit for an instant that a gentleman of your
appearance is not interested in whatever concerns his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Woodcourt, <div class="bookquote">``that may be. I am particularly
interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) address.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The number, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes parenthetically, <div class="bookquote">``I believe I have
already mentioned. If Mr. C. is to continue to play for this
considerable stake, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) must have funds. Understand me! There are
funds in hand at present. I ask for nothing; there are funds in hand.
But for the onward play, more funds must be provided, unless Mr. C.
is to throw away what he (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) has already ventured, which is wholly and
solely a point for his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) consideration. This, sir, I take the
opportunity of stating openly to you as the friend of Mr. C. Without
funds I shall always be happy to appear and act for Mr. C. to the
extent of all such costs as are safe to be allowed out of the estate,
not beyond that. I could not go beyond that, sir, without wronging
some one. I must either wrong my three dear girls or my venerable
father, who is entirely dependent on me, in the Vale of Taunton; or
some one. Whereas, sir, my resolution is -LRB-call it weakness or folly
if you please-RRB- to wrong no one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodcourt rather sternly rejoined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was glad to hear it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, <div class="bookquote">``to leave a good name behind me.
Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of
Mr. C. how Mr. C. is situated. As to myself, sir, the labourer is
worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) hire. If I undertake to put my shoulder to the wheel, I
do it, and I earn what I get. I am here for that purpose. My name is
painted on the door outside, with that object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Carstone's address, Mr. Vholes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Vholes, ``as I believe I have already mentioned,
it is next door. On the second story you will find Mr. C.<div class="bookquote">``s
apartments. Mr. C. desires to be near his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) professional adviser, and I
am far from objecting, for I court inquiry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this Mr. Woodcourt wished Mr. Vholes good day and went in search
of Richard, the change in whose appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) began to understand now
but too well.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in a dull room, fadedly furnished, much as I had found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) barrack-room but a little while before, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was
not writing but was sitting with a book before him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), from which his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
eyes and thoughts were far astray. As the door chanced to be standing
open, Mr. Woodcourt was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) presence for some moments without
being perceived, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) never could forget the
haggardness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) face and the dejection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) manner before he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was
aroused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Woodcourt, my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard, starting up with extended
hands, <div class="bookquote">``you come upon my vision like a ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A friendly one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``and only waiting, as they say ghosts
do, to be addressed. How does the mortal world go?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They were seated
now, near together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Badly enough, and slowly enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``speaking at least
for my part of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What part is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Chancery part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Woodcourt, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``of its
going well yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard moodily. <div class="bookquote">``Who ever did?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) brightened again in
a moment and said with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) natural openness, <div class="bookquote">``Woodcourt, I should be
sorry to be misunderstood by you, even if I gained by it in your
estimation. You must know that I have done no good this long time. I
have not intended to do much harm, but I seem to have been capable of
nothing else. It may be that I should have done better by keeping out
of the net into which my destiny has worked me, but I think not,
though I dare say you will soon hear, if you have not already heard,
a very different opinion. To make short of a long story, I am afraid
I have wanted an object; but I have an object now--or it has me--and
it is too late to discuss it. Take me as I am, and make the best of
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt. <div class="bookquote">``Do as much by me in return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! You,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, <div class="bookquote">``you can pursue your art for its own
sake, and can put your hand upon the plough and never turn, and can
strike a purpose out of anything. You and I are very different
creatures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) spoke regretfully and lapsed for a moment into his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) weary
condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) cried, shaking it off. <div class="bookquote">``Everything has an end. We
shall see! So you will take me as I am, and make the best of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! Indeed I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They shook hands upon it laughingly, but in
deep earnestness. I can answer for one of them with my heart of
hearts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You come as a godsend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``for I have seen nobody here
yet but Vholes. Woodcourt, there is one subject I should like to
mention, for once and for all, in the beginning of our treaty. You
can hardly make the best of me if I don't. You know, I dare say, that
I have an attachment to my cousin Ada?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodcourt replied that I had hinted as much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now pray,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>returned Richard, <div class="bookquote">``don't think me a heap of selfishness. Don't
suppose that I am splitting my head and half breaking my heart over
this miserable Chancery suit for my own rights and interests alone.
Ada's are bound up with mine; they can't be separated; Vholes works
for both of us. Do think of that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was so very solicitous on this head that Mr. Woodcourt gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
the strongest assurances that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) did him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) no injustice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, with something pathetic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) manner of
lingering on the point, though it was off-hand and unstudied, <div class="bookquote">``to an
upright fellow like you, bringing a friendly face like yours here, I
cannot bear the thought of appearing selfish and mean. I want to see
Ada righted, Woodcourt, as well as myself; I want to do my utmost to
right her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), as well as myself; I venture what I can scrape together to
extricate her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), as well as myself. Do, I beseech you, think of that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>Afterwards, when Mr. Woodcourt came to reflect on what had passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
was so very much impressed by the strength of Richard's anxiety on
this point that in telling me generally of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) first visit to
Symond's Inn he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) particularly dwelt upon it. It revived a fear I had
had before that my dear girl's little property would be absorbed by
Mr. Vholes and that Richard's justification to himself would be
sincerely this. It was just as I began to take care of Caddy that the
interview took place, and I now return to the time when Caddy had
recovered and the shade was still between me and my darling.

<p/>I proposed to Ada that morning that we should go and see Richard. It
a little surprised me to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hesitated and was not so
radiantly willing as I had expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you have not had any difference with Richard
since I have been so much away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), perhaps?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Ada.

<p/>Such tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) eyes, and such love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face. I could not make
my darling out. Should I go to Richard's by myself? I said. No, Ada
thought I had better not go by myself. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) go with me? Yes, Ada
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had better go with me. Should we go now? Yes, let us go
now. Well, I could not understand my darling, with the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
eyes and the love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face!

<p/>We were soon equipped and went out. It was a sombre day, and drops of
chill rain fell at intervals. It was one of those colourless days
when everything looks heavy and harsh. The houses frowned at us, the
dust rose at us, the smoke swooped at us, nothing made any compromise
about itself or wore a softened aspect. I fancied my beautiful girl
quite out of place in the rugged streets, and I thought there were
more funerals passing along the dismal pavements than I had ever seen
before.

<p/>We had first to find out Symond's Inn. We were going to inquire in a
shop when Ada said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) thought it was near Chancery Lane. <div class="bookquote">``We are not
likely to be far out, my love, if we go in that direction,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.
So to Chancery Lane we went, and there, sure enough, we saw it
written up. Symond's Inn.

<p/>We had next to find out the number. <div class="bookquote">``Or Mr. Vholes's office will do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I recollected, <div class="bookquote">``for Mr. Vholes's office is next door.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Upon which Ada
said, perhaps that was Mr. Vholes's office in the corner there. And
it really was.

<p/>Then came the question, which of the two next doors? I was going for
the one, and my darling was going for the other; and my darling was
right again. So up we went to the second story, when we came to
Richard's name in great white letters on a hearse-like panel.

<p/>I should have knocked, but Ada said perhaps we had better turn the
handle and go in. Thus we came to Richard, poring over a table
covered with dusty bundles of papers which seemed to me like dusty
mirrors reflecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own mind. Wherever I looked I saw the ominous
words that ran in it repeated. Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) received us very affectionately, and we sat down. <div class="bookquote">``If you had come
a little earlier,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you would have found Woodcourt here.
There never was such a good fellow as Woodcourt is. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) finds time to
look in between-whiles, when anybody else with half his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) work to do
would be thinking about not being able to come. And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is so cheery,
so fresh, so sensible, so earnest, so--everything that I am not, that
the place brightens whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes, and darkens whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) goes
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) truth to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is not so sanguine, Ada,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>continued Richard, casting his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) dejected
look over the bundles of papers, <div class="bookquote">``as Vholes and I are usually, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
is only an outsider and is not in the mysteries. We have gone into
them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has not. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can't be expected to know much of such a
labyrinth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) look wandered over the papers again and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) two
hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head, I noticed how sunken and how large his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) eyes
appeared, how dry his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lips were, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) finger-nails were all
bitten away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this a healthy place to live in, Richard, do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>I. sun</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear Minerva,''  (<font color='red'><b>I. sun</b></font>)</div>answered Richard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) old gay laugh, <div class="bookquote">``it
is neither a rural nor a cheerful place; and when the sun shines
here, you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in
an open spot. But it's well enough for the time. It's near the
offices and near Vholes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hinted, <div class="bookquote">``a change from both--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might do me good?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Richard, forcing a laugh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) finished the
sentence. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't wonder! But it can only come in one way
now--in one of two ways, I should rather say. Either the suit must be
ended, Esther, or the suitor. But it shall be the suit, my dear girl,
the suit, my dear girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div><p/>These latter words were addressed to Ada, who was sitting nearest to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face being turned away from me and towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), I could not
see it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are doing very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>pursued Richard. <div class="bookquote">``Vholes will tell you so.
We are really spinning along. Ask Vholes. We are giving them no rest.
Vholes knows all their windings and turnings, and we are upon them
everywhere. We have astonished them already. We shall rouse up that
nest of sleepers, mark my words!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hopefulness had long been more painful to me than his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
despondency; it was so unlike hopefulness, had something so fierce in
its determination to be it, was so hungry and eager, and yet so
conscious of being forced and unsustainable that it had long touched
me to the heart. But the commentary upon it now indelibly written in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) handsome face made it far more distressing than it used to be. I
say indelibly, for I felt persuaded that if the fatal cause could
have been for ever terminated, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) brightest visions, in
that same hour, the traces of the premature anxiety, self-reproach,
and disappointment it had occasioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would have remained upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
features to the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sight of our dear little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, Ada still
remaining silent and quiet, <div class="bookquote">``is so natural to me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
compassionate face is so like the face of old days--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah! No, no. I smiled and shook my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--So exactly like the face of old days,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Richard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) cordial
voice, and taking my hand with the brotherly regard which nothing
ever changed, <div class="bookquote">``that I can't make pretences with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I fluctuate a
little; that's the truth. Sometimes I hope, my dear, and sometimes
I--don't quite despair, but nearly. I get,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard,
relinquishing my hand gently and walking across the room, <div class="bookquote">``so tired!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) took a few turns up and down and sunk upon the sofa. <div class="bookquote">``I get,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
repeated gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``so tired. It is such weary, weary work!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arm saying these words in a meditative voice
and looking at the ground when my darling rose, put off her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bonnet,
kneeled down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) golden hair falling like sunlight on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) two arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) neck, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face to
me. Oh, what a loving and devoted face I saw!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said very quietly, <div class="bookquote">``I am not going home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A light shone in upon me all at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never any more. I am going to stay with my dear husband. We have
been married above two months. Go home without me, my own Esther; I
shall never go home any more!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With those words my darling drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
head down on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breast and held it there. And if ever in my life I
saw a love that nothing but death could change, I saw it then before
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to Esther, my dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, breaking the silence
presently. <div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) how it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I met her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could come to me and folded her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in my arms. We
neither of us spoke, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cheek against my own I wanted to
hear nothing. <div class="bookquote">``My pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``My love. My poor, poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I
pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so much. I was very fond of Richard, but the impulse that
I had upon me was to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, will you forgive me? Will my cousin John forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to doubt it for a moment is to do him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a great
wrong. And as to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Why, as to me, what had I to forgive!

<p/>I dried my sobbing darling's eyes and sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) on the sofa, and
Richard sat on my other side; and while I was reminded of that so
different night when they had first taken me into their confidence
and had gone on in their own wild happy way, they told me between
them how it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I had was Richard's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>Ada said; <div class="bookquote">``and Richard would not take it,
Esther, and what could I do but be his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wife when I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) dearly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you were so fully and so kindly occupied, excellent Dame
Durden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``that how could we speak to you at such a
time! And besides, it was not a long-considered step. We went out one
morning and were married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when it was done, Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said my darling, <div class="bookquote">``I was always
thinking how to tell you and what to do for the best. And sometimes I
thought you ought to know it directly, and sometimes I thought you
ought not to know it and keep it from my cousin John; and I could not
tell what to do, and I fretted very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>How selfish I must have been not to have thought of this before! I
don't know what I said now. I was so sorry, and yet I was so fond of
them and so glad that they were fond of me; I pitied them so much,
and yet I felt a kind of pride in their loving one another. I never
had experienced such painful and pleasurable emotion at one time, and
in my own heart I did not know which predominated. But I was not
there to darken their way; I did not do that.

<p/>When I was less foolish and more composed, my darling took her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
wedding-ring from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bosom, and kissed it, and put it on. Then I
remembered last night and told Richard that ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) marriage
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had worn it at night when there was no one to see. Then Ada
blushingly asked me how did I know that, my dear. Then I told Ada how
I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hand concealed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) pillow and had little thought
why, my dear. Then they began telling me how it was all over again,
and I began to be sorry and glad again, and foolish again, and to
hide my plain old face as much as I could lest I should put them out
of heart.

<p/>Thus the time went on until it became necessary for me to think of
returning. When that time arrived it was the worst of all, for then
my darling completely broke down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) clung round my neck, calling me
by every dear name she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) could think of and saying what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) do
without me! Nor was Richard much better; and as for me, I should have
been the worst of the three if I had not severely said to myself,
<div class="bookquote">``Now Esther, if you do, I'll never speak to you again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I never saw such a wife. I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
loves her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband at all. Here, Richard, take my child, for goodness'
sake.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) tight all the while, and could have wept over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) I don't know how long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I give this dear young couple notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that I am only going
away to come back to-morrow and that I shall be always coming
backwards and forwards until Symond's Inn is tired of the sight of
me. So I shall not say good-bye, Richard. For what would be the use
of that, you know, when I am coming back so soon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had given my darling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) now, and I meant to go; but I lingered
for one more look of the precious face which it seemed to rive my
heart to turn from.

<p/>So I said -LRB-in a merry, bustling manner-RRB- that unless they gave me some
encouragement to come back, I was not sure that I could take that
liberty, upon which my dear girl looked up, faintly smiling through
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tears, and I folded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lovely face between my hands, and gave it
one last kiss, and laughed, and ran away.

<p/>And when I got downstairs, oh, how I cried! It almost seemed to me
that I had lost my Ada for ever. I was so lonely and so blank without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), and it was so desolate to be going home with no hope of seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) there, that I could get no comfort for a little while as I walked
up and down in a dim corner sobbing and crying.

<p/>I came to myself by and by, after a little scolding, and took a coach
home. The poor boy whom I had found at St. Albans had reappeared a
short time before and was lying at the point of death; indeed, was
then dead, though I did not know it. My guardian had gone out to
inquire about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and did not return to dinner. Being quite alone, I
cried a little again, though on the whole I don't think I behaved so
very, very ill.

<p/>It was only natural that I should not be quite accustomed to the loss
of my darling yet. Three or four hours were not a long time after
years. But my mind dwelt so much upon the uncongenial scene in which
I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and I pictured it as such an overshadowed
stony-hearted one, and I so longed to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and taking some
sort of care of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), that I determined to go back in the evening only
to look up at her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) windows.

<p/>It was foolish, I dare say, but it did not then seem at all so to me,
and it does not seem quite so even now. I took Charley into my
confidence, and we went out at dusk. It was dark when we came to the
new strange home of my dear girl, and there was a light behind the
yellow blinds. We walked past cautiously three or four times, looking
up, and narrowly missed encountering Mr. Vholes, who came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
office while we were there and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) head to look up too before
going home. The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) lank black figure and the lonesome air
of that nook in the dark were favourable to the state of my mind. I
thought of the youth and love and beauty of my dear girl, shut up in
such an ill-assorted refuge, almost as if it were a cruel place.

<p/>It was very solitary and very dull, and I did not doubt that I might
safely steal upstairs. I left Charley below and went up with a light
foot, not distressed by any glare from the feeble oil lanterns on the
way. I listened for a few moments, and in the musty rotting silence
of the house believed that I could hear the murmur of their young
voices. I put my lips to the hearse-like panel of the door as a kiss
for my dear and came quietly down again, thinking that one of these
days I would confess to the visit.

<p/>And it really did me good, for though nobody but Charley and I knew
anything about it, I somehow felt as if it had diminished the
separation between Ada and me and had brought us together again for
those moments. I went back, not quite accustomed yet to the change,
but all the better for that hovering about my darling.

<p/>My guardian had come home and was standing thoughtfully by the dark
window. When I went in, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) face cleared and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) seat, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) caught the light upon my face as I took mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You have been crying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I have been, a little. Ada
has been in such distress, and is so very sorry, guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I put my arm on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) chair, and I saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) glance that
my words and my look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) empty place had prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) married, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) all about it and how her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) first entreaties had referred to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) forgiveness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) has no need of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Heaven bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) husband!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>But just as my first impulse had been to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), so was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Poor
girl, poor girl! Poor Rick! Poor Ada!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither of us spoke after that, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``Well,
well, my dear! Bleak House is thinning fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But its mistress remains, guardian.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Though I was timid about saying
it, I ventured because of the sorrowful tone in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had spoken.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will do all she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) can to make it happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will succeed, my love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter had made no difference between us except that the seat by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) side had come to be mine; it made none now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) old
bright fatherly look upon me, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hand on my hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) old
way, and said again, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will succeed, my dear. Nevertheless, Bleak
House is thinning fast, O little woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I was sorry presently that this was all we said about that. I was
rather disappointed. I feared I might not quite have been all I had
meant to be since the letter and the answer.




<p/>CHAPTER LII

<p/>Obstinacy


<p/>But one other day had intervened when, early in the morning as we
were going to breakfast, Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the
astounding news that a terrible murder had been committed for which
Mr. George had been apprehended and was in custody. When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) told us
that a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the
murderer's apprehension, I did not in my first consternation
understand why; but a few more words explained to me that the
murdered person was Sir Leicester's lawyer, and immediately my
mother's dread of him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) rushed into my remembrance.

<p/>This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had long watched
and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), one for
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have had few intervals of kindness, always dreading in
him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) a dangerous and secret enemy, appeared so awful that my first
thoughts were of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). How appalling to hear of such a death and be
able to feel no pity! How dreadful to remember, perhaps, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
sometimes even wished the old man away who was so swiftly hurried out
of life!

<p/>Such crowding reflections, increasing the distress and fear I always
felt when the name was mentioned, made me so agitated that I could
scarcely hold my place at the table. I was quite unable to follow the
conversation until I had had a little time to recover. But when I
came to myself and saw how shocked my guardian was and found that
they were earnestly speaking of the suspected man and recalling every
favourable impression we had formed of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the good we had
known of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), my interest and my fears were so strongly aroused in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behalf that I was quite set up again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guardian, you don't think it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) is justly accused?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``My dear, I CAN<div class="bookquote">``T think so. This man whom we have seen so
open-hearted and compassionate, who with the might of a giant has the
gentleness of a child, who looks as brave a fellow as ever lived and
is so simple and quiet with it, this man justly accused of such a
crime? I can't believe it. It's not that I don't or I won't. I
can't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt. <div class="bookquote">``Still, whatever we believe or
know of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), we had better not forget that some appearances are
against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has openly mentioned it in many places. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is said to have expressed
himself violently towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly did about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to my
knowledge. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alone on the scene of the murder
within a few minutes of its commission. I sincerely believe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be
as innocent of any participation in it as I am, but these are all
reasons for suspicion falling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) added, turning to me, <div class="bookquote">``It would be
doing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a very bad service, my dear, to shut our eyes to the truth
in any of these respects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt, of course, that we must admit, not only to ourselves but to
others, the full force of the circumstances against him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). Yet I knew
withal -LRB-I could not help saying-RRB- that their weight would not induce
us to desert him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) need.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``We will stand by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) meant Mr.
Gridley and the boy, to both of whom Mr. George had given shelter.

<p/>Mr. Woodcourt then told us that the trooper's man had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
before day, after wandering about the streets all night like a
distracted creature. That one of the trooper's first anxieties was
that we should not suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) guilty. That he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) had charged his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
messenger to represent his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) perfect innocence with every solemn
assurance he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) could send us. That Mr. Woodcourt had only quieted the
man by undertaking to come to our house very early in the morning
with these representations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was now upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) way to
see the prisoner himself.

<p/>My guardian said directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would go too. Now, besides that I liked
the retired soldier very much and that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) liked me, I had that secret
interest in what had happened which was only known to my guardian. I
felt as if it came close and near to me. It seemed to become
personally important to myself that the truth should be discovered
and that no innocent people should be suspected, for suspicion, once
run wild, might run wilder.

<p/>In a word, I felt as if it were my duty and obligation to go with
them. My guardian did not seek to dissuade me, and I went.

<p/>It was a large prison with many courts and passages so like one
another and so uniformly paved that I seemed to gain a new
comprehension, as I passed along, of the fondness that solitary
prisoners, shut up among the same staring walls from year to year,
have had--as I have read--for a weed or a stray blade of grass. In an
arched room by himself, like a cellar upstairs, with walls so
glaringly white that they made the massive iron window-bars and
iron-bound door even more profoundly black than they were, we found
the trooper standing in a corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) had been sitting on a bench
there and had risen when he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) heard the locks and bolts turn.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) saw us, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) came forward a step with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) usual heavy tread,
and there stopped and made a slight bow. But as I still advanced,
putting out my hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) understood us in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a load off my mind, I do assure you, miss and gentlemen,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), saluting us with great heartiness and drawing a long breath.
<div class="bookquote">``And now I don't so much care how it ends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) scarcely seemed to be the prisoner. What with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) coolness and his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
soldierly bearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) looked far more like the prison guard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is even a rougher place than my gallery to receive a lady in,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) handed me to the bench on which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been sitting, I sat
down, which seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) great satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``as we require no new assurances
on your part, so I believe we need give you none on ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, sir. I thank you with all my heart. If I was not
innocent of this crime, I couldn't look at you and keep my secret to
myself under the condescension of the present visit. I feel the
present visit very much. I am not one of the eloquent sort, but I
feel it, Miss Summerson and gentlemen, deeply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand for a moment on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) broad chest and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head to
us. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) squared himself again directly, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) expressed a great
amount of natural emotion by these simple means.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``can we do anything for your personal
comfort, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For which, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) inquired, clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For your personal comfort. Is there anything you want that would
lessen the hardship of this confinement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>replied George, after a little cogitation, <div class="bookquote">``I am equally
obliged to you, but tobacco being against the rules, I can't say that
there is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will think of many little things perhaps, by and by. Whenever
you do, George, let us know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir. Howsoever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. George with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
sunburnt smiles, <div class="bookquote">``a man who has been knocking about the world in a
vagabond kind of a way as long as I have gets on well enough in a
place like the present, so far as that goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next, as to your case,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. George, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
breast with perfect self-possession and a little curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How does it stand now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, it is under remand at present. Bucket gives me to
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will probably apply for a series of remands from
time to time until the case is more complete. How it is to be made
more complete I don't myself see, but I dare say Bucket will manage
it somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, heaven save us, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my guardian, surprised into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
old oddity and vehemence, <div class="bookquote">``you talk of yourself as if you were
somebody else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No offence, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George. ``I am very sensible of your
kindness. But I don't see how an innocent man is to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind
to this kind of thing without knocking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head against the walls
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes it in that point of view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true enough to a certain extent,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian,
softened. <div class="bookquote">``But my good fellow, even an innocent man must take
ordinary precautions to defend himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Certainly, sir. And I have done so. I have stated to the
magistrates, ``Gentlemen, I am as innocent of this charge as
yourselves; what has been stated against me in the way of facts is
perfectly true; I know no more about it.<div class="bookquote">'' I intend to continue
stating that, sir. What more can I do? It's the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the mere truth won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>rejoined my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it indeed, sir? Rather a bad look-out for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George
good-humouredly observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have a lawyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>pursued my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``We must engage a good
one for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George with a step backward. <div class="bookquote">``I am
equally obliged. But I must decidedly beg to be excused from anything
of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't have a lawyer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>Mr. George shook his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head in the most emphatic manner. <div class="bookquote">``I
thank you all the same, sir, but--no lawyer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't take kindly to the breed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``Gridley didn't.
And--if you'll excuse my saying so much--I should hardly have thought
you did yourself, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's equity,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>my guardian explained, a little at a loss; <div class="bookquote">``that's
equity, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it, indeed, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returned the trooper in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) off-hand manner. <div class="bookquote">``I
am not acquainted with those shades of names myself, but in a general
way I object to the breed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Unfolding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms and changing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) position, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stood with one
massive hand upon the table and the other on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hip, as complete a
picture of a man who was not to be moved from a fixed purpose as ever
I saw. It was in vain that we all three talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and endeavoured
to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened with that gentleness which went so well
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bluff bearing, but was evidently no more shaken by our
representations that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place of confinement was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray think, once more, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Have you no wish in
reference to your case?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly could wish it to be tried, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``by
court-martial; but that is out of the question, as I am well aware.
If you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a
couple of minutes, miss, not more, I'll endeavour to explain myself
as clearly as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at us all three in turn, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head a little as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
were adjusting it in the stock and collar of a tight uniform, and
after a moment's reflection went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, miss, I have been handcuffed and taken into custody and
brought here. I am a marked and disgraced man, and here I am. My
shooting gallery is rummaged, high and low, by Bucket; such property
as I have--`tis small--is turned this way and that till it don't know
itself; and -LRB-as aforesaid-RRB- here I am! I don't particular complain of
that. Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately
preceding fault of mine, I can very well understand that if I hadn't
gone into the vagabond way in my youth, this wouldn't have happened.
It HAS happened. Then comes the question how to meet it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swarthy forehead for a moment with a good-humoured look
and said apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``I am such a short-winded talker that I must
think a bit.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Having thought a bit, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up again and resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How to meet it. Now, the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer
and had a pretty tight hold of me. I don't wish to rake up his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) ashes,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had, what I should call if he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was living, a devil of a tight
hold of me. I don't like his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) trade the better for that. If I had kept
clear of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) trade, I should have kept outside this place. But that's
not what I mean. Now, suppose I had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). Suppose I really had
discharged into his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) body any one of those pistols recently fired off
that Bucket has found at my place, and dear me, might have found
there any day since it has been my place. What should I have done as
soon as I was hard and fast here? Got a lawyer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped on hearing some one at the locks and bolts and did not
resume until the door had been opened and was shut again. For what
purpose opened, I will mention presently.

<p/>``I should have got a lawyer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would have said -LRB-as I have often
read in the newspapers-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``My client says nothing, my client reserves
his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) defence': my client this, that, and t`other. Well, `tis not the
custom of that breed to go straight, according to my opinion, or to
think that other men do. Say I am innocent and I get a lawyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
would be as likely to believe me guilty as not; perhaps more. What
would he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) do, whether or not? Act as if I was--shut my mouth up, tell
me not to commit myself, keep circumstances back, chop the evidence
small, quibble, and get me off perhaps! But, Miss Summerson, do I
care for getting off in that way; or would I rather be hanged in my
own way--if you'll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a
lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had warmed into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subject now, and was under no further
necessity to wait a bit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather be hanged in my own way. And I mean to be! I don't
intend to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>looking round upon us with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) powerful arms akimbo
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dark eyebrows raised, <div class="bookquote">``that I am more partial to being hanged
than another man. What I say is, I must come off clear and full or
not at all. Therefore, when I hear stated against me what is true, I
say it's true; and when they tell me, `whatever you say will be
used,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tell them I don't mind that; I mean it to be used. If they
can't make me innocent out of the whole truth, they are not likely to
do it out of anything less, or anything else. And if they are, it's
worth nothing to me.''

<p/>Taking a pace or two over the stone floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came back to the table
and finished what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, miss and gentlemen both, many times for your attention,
and many times more for your interest. That's the plain state of the
matter as it points itself out to a mere trooper with a blunt
broadsword kind of a mind. I have never done well in life beyond my
duty as a soldier, and if the worst comes after all, I shall reap
pretty much as I have sown. When I got over the first crash of being
seized as a murderer--it don't take a rover who has knocked about so
much as myself so very long to recover from a crash--I worked my way
round to what you find me now. As such I shall remain. No relations
will be disgraced by me or made unhappy for me, and--and that's all
I've got to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>another man</b></font>)</div><p/>The door had been opened to admit another soldier-looking man of less
prepossessing appearance at first sight and a weather-tanned,
bright-eyed wholesome woman with a basket, who, from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entrance,
had been exceedingly attentive to all Mr. George had said. Mr. George
had received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look, but
without any more particular greeting in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) address. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
now shook them cordially by the hand and said, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson and
gentlemen, this is an old comrade of mine, Matthew Bagnet. And this
is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wife, Mrs. Bagnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet made us a stiff military bow, and Mrs. Bagnet dropped us a
curtsy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Real good friends of mine, they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>sald Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``It was at
their house I was taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a second-hand wiolinceller,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bagnet put in, twitching his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
head angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Of a good tone. For a friend. That money was no object
to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, <div class="bookquote">``you have heard pretty well all I have been
saying to this lady and these two gentlemen. I know it meets your
approval?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bagnet, after considering, referred the point to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Old
girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mat</b></font>). Whether or not. It meets my approval.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Bagnet, who had been unpacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
basket, in which there was a piece of cold pickled pork, a little tea
and sugar, and a brown loaf, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to know it don't. You ought
to know it's enough to drive a person wild to hear you. You won't be
got off this way, and you won't be got off that way--what do you mean
by such picking and choosing? It's stuff and nonsense, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be severe upon me in my misfortunes, Mrs. Bagnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>said the
trooper lightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Bother your misfortunes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``if they don't make
you more reasonable than that comes to. I never was so ashamed in my
life to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this
day to the present company. Lawyers? Why, what but too many cooks
should hinder you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman
recommended them to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a very sensible woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), Mrs. Bagnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, no. You don't
know George. Now, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bagnet left her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) basket to point him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
out with both her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) bare brown hands. <div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stands! As self-willed
and as determined a man, in the wrong way, as ever put a human
creature under heaven out of patience! You could as soon take up and
shoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn that
man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got a thing into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and fixed it there. Why,
don't I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bagnet. <div class="bookquote">``Don't I know you, George! You
don't mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these
years, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) husband,
who shook his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head at the trooper several times as a silent
recommendation to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to yield. Between whiles, Mrs. Bagnet looked at
me; and I understood from the play of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wished me to
do something, though I did not comprehend what.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have given up talking to you, old fellow, years and years,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bagnet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) blew a little dust off the pickled pork,
looking at me again; <div class="bookquote">``and when ladies and gentlemen know you as well
as I do, they'll give up talking to you too. If you are not too
headstrong to accept of a bit of dinner, here it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I accept it with many thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returned the trooper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you though, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bagnet, continuing to grumble on
good-humouredly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I'm surprised at that. I wonder you don't
starve in your own way also. It would only be like you. Perhaps
you'll set your mind upon THAT next.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) again looked at me,
and I now perceived from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) glances at the door and at me, by turns,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) wished us to retire and to await her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) following us outside
the prison. Communicating this by similar means to my guardian and
Mr. Woodcourt, I rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We hope you will think better of it, Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and we
shall come to see you again, trusting to find you more reasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More grateful, Miss Summerson, you can't find me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But more persuadable we can, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And let me entreat
you to consider that the clearing up of this mystery and the
discovery of the real perpetrator of this deed may be of the last
importance to others besides yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) heard me respectfully but without much heeding these words, which
I spoke a little turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>), already on my way to the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
was observing -LRB-this they afterwards told me-RRB- my height and figure,
which seemed to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) attention all at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis curious,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And yet I thought so at the time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``when my ill fortune took me to the dead
man's staircase on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murder, I saw a shape so like
Miss Summerson's go by me in the dark that I had half a mind to speak
to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant I felt such a shudder as I never felt before or since
and hope I shall never feel again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It came downstairs as I went up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper window</b></font>)</div>said the trooper, <div class="bookquote">``and crossed the
moonlighted window with a loose black mantle on; I noticed a deep
fringe to it. However, it has nothing to do with the present subject,
excepting that Miss Summerson looked so like it at the moment that it
came into my head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper window</b></font>)</div><p/>I cannot separate and define the feelings that arose in me after
this; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon
me from the first of following the investigation was, without my
distinctly daring to ask myself any question, increased, and that I
was indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my
being afraid.

<p/>We three went out of the prison and walked up and down at some short
distance from the gate, which was in a retired place. We had not
waited long when Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet came out too and quickly joined
us.

<p/>There was a tear in each of Mrs. Bagnet's eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) face was
flushed and hurried. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't let George see what I thought about
it, you know, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) first remark when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) came up, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s
in a bad way, poor old fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with care and prudence and good help,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman like you ought to know best, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Bagnet,
hurriedly drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) eyes on the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) grey cloak, <div class="bookquote">``but I am
uneasy for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been so careless and said so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
never meant. The gentlemen of the juries might not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as
Lignum and me do. And then such a number of circumstances have
happened bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and such a number of people will be brought
forward to speak against him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and Bucket is so deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a second-hand wiolinceller. And said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) played the fife. When a
boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bagnet added with great solemnity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I tell you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bagnet; <div class="bookquote">``and when I say miss, I
mean all! Just come into the corner of the wall and I'll tell you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet hurried us into a more secluded place and was at first
too breathless to proceed, occasioning Mr. Bagnet to say, <div class="bookquote">``Old girl!
Tell 'em!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the old girl proceeded, untying the strings of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
bonnet for more air, <div class="bookquote">``you could as soon move Dover Castle as move
George on this point unless you had got a new power to move him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with.
And I have got it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a jewel of a woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I tell you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proceeded, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hurry and agitation a dozen times in every sentence, <div class="bookquote">``that what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
says concerning no relations is all bosh. They don't know of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) does know of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has said more to me at odd times than to
anybody else, and it warn't for nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) once spoke to my
Woolwich about whitening and wrinkling mothers' heads. For fifty
pounds he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother that day. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s alive and must be
brought here straight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>Instantly Mrs. Bagnet put some pins into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) mouth and began pinning
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) skirts all round a little higher than the level of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) grey
cloak, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) accomplished with surpassing dispatch and dexterity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lignum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``you take care of the children, old man,
and give me the umbrella! I'm away to Lincolnshire to bring that old
lady here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, bless the woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>cried my guardian with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>)
pocket, <div class="bookquote">``how is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) going? What money has she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bagnet made another application to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) skirts and brought forth
a leathern purse in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hastily counted over a few shillings
and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) then shut up with perfect satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind for me, miss. I'm a soldier's wife and accustomed to
travel my own way. Lignum, old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``one for yourself,
three for the children. Now I'm away into Lincolnshire after George's
mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) actually set off while we three stood looking at one another
lost in amazement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) actually trudged away in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) grey cloak at a
sturdy pace, and turned the corner, and was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bagnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) go in that
way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) returned. ``Made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) way home once from another
quarter of the world. With the same grey cloak. And same umbrella.
Whatever the old girl says, do. Do it! Whenever the old girl says,
I<div class="bookquote">``LL do it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is as honest and genuine as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>rejoined my

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s Colour-Sergeant of the Nonpareil battalion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bagnet/Bagnet/Matthew Bagnet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bagnet,
looking at us over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) way also. <div class="bookquote">``And there's
not such another. But I never own to it before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Discipline must

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LIII

<p/>The Track


<p/>Mr. Bucket and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fat forefinger are much in consultation together
under existing circumstances. When Mr. Bucket has a matter of this
pressing interest under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) consideration, the fat forefinger seems
to rise, to the dignity of a familiar demon. He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) puts it to his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) ears,
and it whispers information; he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) puts it to his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) lips, and it enjoins
him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) to secrecy; he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) rubs it over his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) nose, and it sharpens his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) scent;
he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) shakes it before a guilty man, and it charms him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>)
destruction. The Augurs of the Detective Temple invariably predict
that when Mr. Bucket and that finger are in much conference, a
terrible avenger will be heard of before long.

<p/>Otherwise mildly studious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) observation of human nature, on the
whole a benignant philosopher not disposed to be severe upon the
follies of mankind, Mr. Bucket pervades a vast number of houses and
strolls about an infinity of streets, to outward appearance rather
languishing for want of an object. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is in the friendliest condition
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) species and will drink with most of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is free with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) money, affable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) manners, innocent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) conversation--but
through the placid stream of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) life there glides an under-current
of forefinger.

<p/>Time and place cannot bind Mr. Bucket. Like man in the abstract, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
is here to-day and gone to-morrow--but, very unlike man indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
here again the next day. This evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be casually looking
into the iron extinguishers at the door of Sir Leicester Dedlock's
house in town; and to-morrow morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be walking on the leads
at Chesney Wold, where erst the old man walked whose ghost is
propitiated with a hundred guineas. Drawers, desks, pockets, all
things belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mr. Bucket examines. A few hours afterwards,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and the Roman will be alone together comparing forefingers.

<p/>It is likely that these occupations are irreconcilable with home
enjoyment, but it is certain that Mr. Bucket at present does not go
home. Though in general he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) highly appreciates the society of Mrs.
Bucket--a lady of a natural detective genius, which if it had been
improved by professional exercise, might have done great things, but
which has paused at the level of a clever amateur--he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) holds himself
aloof from that dear solace. Mrs. Bucket is dependent on their lodger
-LRB-fortunately an amiable lady in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) takes an interest-RRB- for
companionship and conversation.

<p/>A great crowd assembles in Lincoln's Inn Fields on the day of the
funeral. Sir Leicester Dedlock attends the ceremony in person;
strictly speaking, there are only three other human followers, that
is to say, Lord Doodle, William Buffy, and the debilitated cousin
-LRB-thrown in as a make-weight-RRB-, but the amount of inconsolable
carriages is immense. The peerage contributes more four-wheeled
affliction than has ever been seen in that neighbourhood. Such is the
assemblage of armorial bearings on coach panels that the Herald's
College might be supposed to have lost its father and mother at a
blow. The Duke of Foodle sends a splendid pile of dust and ashes,
with silver wheel-boxes, patent axles, all the last improvements, and
three bereaved worms, six feet high, holding on behind, in a bunch of
woe. All the state coachmen in London seem plunged into mourning; and
if that dead old man of the rusty garb be not beyond a taste in
horseflesh -LRB-which appears impossible-RRB-, it must be highly gratified
this day.

<p/>Quiet among the undertakers and the equipages and the calves of so
many legs all steeped in grief, Mr. Bucket sits concealed in one of
the inconsolable carriages and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) ease surveys the crowd through
the lattice blinds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) has a keen eye for a crowd--as for what
not?--and looking here and there, now from this side of the carriage,
now from the other, now up at the house windows, now along the
people's heads, nothing escapes him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there you are, my partner, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket to himself,
apostrophizing Mrs. Bucket, stationed, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) favour, on the steps of
the deceased's house. <div class="bookquote">``And so you are. And so you are! And very well
indeed you are looking, Mrs. Bucket!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The procession has not started yet, but is waiting for the cause of
its assemblage to be brought out. Mr. Bucket, in the foremost
emblazoned carriage, uses his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) two fat forefingers to hold the lattice
a hair's breadth open while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looks.

<p/>And it says a great deal for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) attachment, as a husband, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is
still occupied with Mrs. B. <div class="bookquote">``There you are, my partner, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
murmuringly repeats. <div class="bookquote">``And our lodger with you. I'm taking notice of
you, Mrs. Bucket; I hope you're all right in your health, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Not another word does Mr. Bucket say, but sits with most attentive
eyes until the sacked depository of noble secrets is brought
down--Where are all those secrets now? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) keep them yet? Did
they fly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) on that sudden journey?--and until the procession
moves, and Mr. Bucket's view is changed. After which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) composes
himself for an easy ride and takes note of the fittings of the
carriage in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) should ever find such knowledge useful.

<p/>Contrast enough between Mr. Tulkinghorn shut up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) dark carriage
and Mr. Bucket shut up in HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>). Between the immeasurable track of
space beyond the little wound that has thrown the one into the fixed
sleep which jolts so heavily over the stones of the streets, and the
narrow track of blood which keeps the other in the watchful state
expressed in every hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) head! But it is all one to both;
neither is troubled about that.

<p/>Mr. Bucket sits out the procession in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) own easy manner and glides
from the carriage when the opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) has settled with himself
arrives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) makes for Sir Leicester Dedlock's, which is at present a
sort of home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>), where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) comes and goes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) likes at all
hours, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) is always welcome and made much of, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) knows
the whole establishment, and walks in an atmosphere of mysterious
greatness.

<p/>No knocking or ringing for Mr. Bucket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has caused himself to be
provided with a key and can pass in at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pleasure. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is
crossing the hall, Mercury informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Here's another letter for
you, Mr. Bucket, come by post,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and gives it him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another one, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.

<p/>If Mercury should chance to be possessed by any lingering curiosity
as to Mr. Bucket's letters, that wary person is not the man to
gratify it. Mr. Bucket looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face were a vista of
some miles in length and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) were leisurely contemplating the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you happen to carry a box?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.

<p/>Unfortunately Mercury is no snuff-taker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you fetch me a pinch from anywheres?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.
<div class="bookquote">``Thankee. It don't matter what it is; I'm not particular as to the
kind. Thankee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>Having leisurely helped himself from a canister borrowed from
somebody downstairs for the purpose, and having made a considerable
show of tasting it, first with one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) nose and then with the
other, Mr. Bucket, with much deliberation, pronounces it of the right
sort and goes on, letter in hand.

<p/>Now although Mr. Bucket walks upstairs to the little library within
the larger one with the face of a man who receives some scores of
letters every day, it happens that much correspondence is not
incidental to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is no great scribe, rather handling his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
pen like the pocket-staff he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) carries about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) always convenient
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) grasp, and discourages correspondence with himself in others
as being too artless and direct a way of doing delicate business.
Further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) often sees damaging letters produced in evidence and has
occasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them. For
these reasons he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has very little to do with letters, either as sender
or receiver. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has received a round half-dozen within the
last twenty-four hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, spreading it out on the table, <div class="bookquote">``is in
the same hand, and consists of the same two words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>What two words?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turns the key in the door, ungirdles his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) black pocket-book -LRB-book
of fate to many-RRB-, lays another letter by it, and reads, boldly
written in each, <div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``But I could have made the money without
this anonymous information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Having put the letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) book of fate and girdled it up again,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) unlocks the door just in time to admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) dinner, which is
brought upon a goodly tray with a decanter of sherry. Mr. Bucket
frequently observes, in friendly circles where there is no restraint,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) likes a toothful of your fine old brown East Inder sherry
better than anything you can offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fills and
empties his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) glass with a smack of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) lips and is proceeding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
refreshment when an idea enters his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Mr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room
and the next and looks in. The library is deserted, and the fire is
sinking low. Mr. Bucket's eye, after taking a pigeon-flight round the
room, alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they
arrive. Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it. Mr. Bucket
draws near and examines the directions. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``there's none
in that hand. It's only me as is written to. I can break it to Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) returns to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) dinner with a good appetite, and
after a light nap, is summoned into the drawing-room. Sir Leicester
has received him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) there these several evenings past to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
has anything to report. The debilitated cousin -LRB-much exhausted by the
funeral-RRB- and Volumnia are in attendance.

<p/>Mr. Bucket makes three distinctly different bows to these three
people. A bow of homage to Sir Leicester, a bow of gallantry to
Volumnia, and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin, to whom
it airily says, <div class="bookquote">``You are a swell about town, and you know me, and I
know you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Cousin</b></font>)</div>Having distributed these little specimens of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) tact, Mr.
Bucket rubs his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything new to communicate, officer?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquires Sir
Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--not to-night, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because my time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>pursues Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``is wholly at your disposal
with a view to the vindication of the outraged majesty of the law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket coughs and glances at Volumnia, rouged and necklaced, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would respectfully observe, <div class="bookquote">``I do assure you, you're a
pretty creetur. I've seen hundreds worse looking at your time of
life, I have indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The fair Volumnia, not quite unconscious perhaps of the humanizing
influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) charms, pauses in the writing of cocked-hat notes
and meditatively adjusts the pearl necklace. Mr. Bucket prices that
decoration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mind and thinks it as likely as not that Volumnia
is writing poetry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pursues Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``in the most emphatic manner,
adjured you, officer, to exercise your utmost skill in this atrocious
case, I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of
rectifying any omission I may have made. Let no expense be a
consideration. I am prepared to defray all charges. You can incur
none in pursuit of the object you have undertaken that I shall
hesitate for a moment to bear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket made Sir Leicester's bow again as a response to this
liberality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester adds with a generous warmth, <div class="bookquote">``has not, as
may be easily supposed, recovered its tone since the late diabolical
occurrence. It is not likely ever to recover its tone. But it is full
of indignation to-night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to
the tomb the remains of a faithful, a zealous, a devoted adherent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester's voice trembles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) grey hair stirs upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) head.
Tears are in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) eyes; the best part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) nature is aroused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I solemnly declare that until this crime is
discovered and, in the course of justice, punished, I almost feel as
if there were a stain upon my name. A gentleman who has devoted a
large portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life to me, a gentleman who has devoted the last
day of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life to me, a gentleman who has constantly sat at my table
and slept under my roof, goes from my house to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own, and is struck
down within an hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leaving my house. I cannot say but that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
may have been followed from my house, watched at my house, even first
marked because of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) association with my house--which may have
suggested his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) possessing greater wealth and being altogether of
greater importance than his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own retiring demeanour would have
indicated. If I cannot with my means and influence and my position
bring all the perpetrators of such a crime to light, I fail in the
assertion of my respect for that gentleman's memory and of my
fidelity towards one who was ever faithful to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) makes this protestation with great emotion and earnestness,
looking round the room as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) were addressing an assembly, Mr.
Bucket glances at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) with an observant gravity in which there might
be, but for the audacity of the thought, a touch of compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ceremony of to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continues Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``strikingly
illustrative of the respect in which my deceased friend'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) lays a
stress upon the word, for death levels all distinctions--<div class="bookquote">``was held by
the flower of the land, has, I say, aggravated the shock I have
received from this most horrible and audacious crime. If it were my
brother who had committed it, I would not spare him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket looks very grave. Volumnia remarks of the deceased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
was the trustiest and dearest person!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must feel it as a deprivation to you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>replies Mr. Bucket
soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``no doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was calculated to BE a deprivation, I'm
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia gives Mr. Bucket to understand, in reply, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sensitive
mind is fully made up never to get the better of it as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
lives, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) nerves are unstrung for ever, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has not
the least expectation of ever smiling again. Meanwhile she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) folds up a
cocked hat for that redoubtable old general at Bath, descriptive of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) melancholy condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It gives a start to a delicate female,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket
sympathetically, <div class="bookquote">``but it'll wear off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia wishes of all things to know what is doing? Whether they are
going to convict, or whatever it is, that dreadful soldier? Whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law?
And a great deal more to the like artless purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why you see, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, bringing the finger into
persuasive action--and such is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) natural gallantry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) had
almost said <div class="bookquote">``my dear'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``it ain't easy to answer those questions at
the present moment. Not at the present moment. I've kept myself on
this case, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whom Mr. Bucket takes
into the conversation in right of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) importance, <div class="bookquote">``morning, noon, and
night. But for a glass or two of sherry, I don't think I could have
had my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been. I COULD answer
your questions, miss, but duty forbids it. Sir Leicester Dedlock,
Baronet, will very soon be made acquainted with all that has been
traced. And I hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may find it'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Bucket again looks
grave--<div class="bookquote">``to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) satisfaction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>The debilitated cousin only hopes some fler'll be executed--zample.
Thinks more interest's wanted--get man hanged presentime--than get
man place ten thousand a year. Hasn't a doubt--zample--far better
hang wrong fler than no fler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU know life, you know, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket with a complimentary
twinkle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eye and crook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) finger, <div class="bookquote">``and you can confirm what
I've mentioned to this lady. YOU don't want to be told that from
information I have received I have gone to work. You're up to what a
lady can't be expected to be up to. Lord! Especially in your elevated
station of society, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>crook</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, quite reddening at
another narrow escape from <div class="bookquote">``my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The officer, Volumnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``is faithful to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
duty, and perfectly right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket murmurs, <div class="bookquote">``Glad to have the honour of your approbation, Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In fact, Volumnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>proceeds Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``it is not holding up a
good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you
have put to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is the best judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) own responsibility; he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
acts upon his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) responsibility. And it does not become us, who assist
in making the laws, to impede or interfere with those who carry them
into execution. Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly, for
Volumnia was going to cut in before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had rounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sentence, <div class="bookquote">``or
who vindicate their outraged majesty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia with all humility explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had not merely the plea
of curiosity to urge -LRB-in common with the giddy youth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sex in
general-RRB- but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is perfectly dying with regret and interest for
the darling man whose loss they all deplore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Volumnia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Then you cannot be too
discreet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket takes the opportunity of a pause to be heard again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I have no objections to telling this
lady, with your leave and among ourselves, that I look upon the case
as pretty well complete. It is a beautiful case--a beautiful
case--and what little is wanting to complete it, I expect to be able
to supply in a few hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad indeed to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Highly
creditable to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket very seriously,
<div class="bookquote">``I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit and prove
satisfactory to all. When I depict it as a beautiful case, you see,
miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket goes on, glancing gravely at Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``I mean
from my point of view. As considered from other points of view, such
cases will always involve more or less unpleasantness. Very strange
things comes to our knowledge in families, miss; bless your heart,
what you would think to be phenomenons, quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) innocent little scream, supposes so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, and even in gen-teel families, in high families, in great
families,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, again gravely eyeing Sir Leicester aside.
<div class="bookquote">``I have had the honour of being employed in high families before, and
you have no idea--come, I'll go so far as to say not even YOU have
any idea, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>this to the debilitated cousin, <div class="bookquote">``what games goes on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>The cousin, who has been casting sofa-pillows on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) head, in a
prostration of boredom yawns, <div class="bookquote">``Vayli,''  (<font color='red'><b>The cousin</b></font>)</div>being the used-up for <div class="bookquote">``very
likely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester, deeming it time to dismiss the officer, here
majestically interposes with the words, <div class="bookquote">``Very good. Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>and
also with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hand, implying not only that there is an end
of the discourse, but that if high families fall into low habits they
must take the consequences. <div class="bookquote">``You will not forget, officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) adds
with condescension, <div class="bookquote">``that I am at your disposal when you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket -LRB-still grave-RRB- inquires if to-morrow morning, now, would
suit, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) should be as for`ard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) expects to be. Sir
Leicester replies, <div class="bookquote">``All times are alike to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
three bows and is withdrawing when a forgotten point occurs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Might I ask, by the by,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) says in a low voice, cautiously
returning, <div class="bookquote">``who posted the reward-bill on the staircase.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ordered it to be put up there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replies Sir Leicester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it be considered a liberty, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, if
I was to ask you why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house. I think
it cannot be too prominently kept before the whole establishment. I
wish my people to be impressed with the enormity of the crime, the
determination to punish it, and the hopelessness of escape. At the
same time, officer, if you in your better knowledge of the subject
see any objection--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket sees none now; the bill having been put up, had better not
be taken down. Repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) three bows he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) withdraws, closing the
door on Volumnia's little scream, which is a preliminary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
remarking that that charmingly horrible person is a perfect Blue
Chamber.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) fondness for society and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) adaptability to all grades, Mr.
Bucket is presently standing before the hall-fire--bright and warm on
the early winter night--admiring Mercury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you're six foot two, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Mercury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you so much? But then, you see, you're broad in proportion and
don't look it. You're not one of the weak-legged ones, you ain't. Was
you ever modelled now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket asks, conveying the expression of
an artist into the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) eye and head.

<p/>Mercury never was modelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you ought to be, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket; <div class="bookquote">``and a friend of
mine that you'll hear of one day as a Royal Academy sculptor would
stand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for
the marble. My Lady's out, ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goes out pretty well every day, don't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to be wondered at!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Such a fine woman as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
so handsome and so graceful and so elegant, is like a fresh lemon on
a dinner-table, ornamental wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes. Was your father in the
same way of life as yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Answer in the negative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``My father was first a page, then a
footman, then a butler, then a steward, then an inn-keeper. Lived
universally respected, and died lamented. Said with his (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) last breath
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) considered service the most honourable part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) career,
and so it was. I've a brother in service, AND a brother-in-law. My
Lady a good temper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mercury replies, <div class="bookquote">``As good as you can expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``A little spoilt? A little capricious? Lord!
What can you anticipate when they're so handsome as that? And we like
'em all the better for it, don't we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Mercury, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hands in the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bright peach-blossom
small-clothes, stretches his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) symmetrical silk legs with the air of a
man of gallantry and can't deny it. Come the roll of wheels and a
violent ringing at the bell. <div class="bookquote">``Talk of the angels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.
<div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The doors are thrown open, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) passes through the hall. Still
very pale, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful
bracelets. Either their beauty or the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arms is
particularly attractive to Mr. Bucket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looks at them with an eager
eye and rattles something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pocket--halfpence perhaps.

<p/>Noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) distance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turns an inquiring look on the
other Mercury who has brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bucket, my Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) familiar demon
over the region of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you waiting to see Sir Leicester?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my Lady, I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything to say to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just at present, my Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you made any new discoveries?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A few, my Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This is merely in passing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) scarcely makes a stop, and sweeps
upstairs alone. Mr. Bucket, moving towards the staircase-foot,
watches her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) goes up the steps the old man came down to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
grave, past murderous groups of statuary repeated with their shadowy
weapons on the wall, past the printed bill, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looks at going
by, out of view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s a lovely woman, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) really is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, coming
back to Mercury. <div class="bookquote">``Don't look quite healthy though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Is not quite healthy, Mercury informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Suffers much from
headaches.

<p/>Really? That's a pity! Walking, Mr. Bucket would recommend for that.
Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tries walking, Mercury rejoins. Walks sometimes for two
hours when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has them bad. By night, too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>asks Mr.
Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a doubt about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're so well put together that I shouldn't have thought it. But
the household troops, though considered fine men, are built so
straggling. Walks by night, does she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)? When it's moonlight, though?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, yes. When it's moonlight! Of course. Oh, of course!
Conversational and acquiescent on both sides.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you ain't in the habit of walking yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Not much time for it, I should say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Besides which, Mercury don't like it. Prefers carriage exercise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``That makes a difference. Now I think
of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, warming his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hands and looking pleasantly at
the blaze, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) went out walking the very night of this business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did! I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) into the garden over the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) there. Certainly you did. I saw you doing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Mercury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was rather in a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``for I was going to
visit a aunt of mine that lives at Chelsea--next door but two to the
old original Bun House--ninety year old the old lady is, a single
woman, and got a little property. Yes, I chanced to be passing at the
time. Let's see. What time might it be? It wasn't ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-past nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right. So it was. And if I don't deceive myself, my Lady was
muffled in a loose black mantle, with a deep fringe to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was. Mr. Bucket must return to a little work he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) has to
get on with upstairs, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) must shake hands with Mercury in
acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) agreeable conversation, and will he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)--this is
all he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) asks--will he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) has a leisure half-hour, think of
bestowing it on that Royal Academy sculptor, for the advantage of
both parties?




<p/>CHAPTER LIV

<p/>Springing a Mine


<p/>Refreshed by sleep, Mr. Bucket rises betimes in the morning and
prepares for a field-day. Smartened up by the aid of a clean shirt
and a wet hairbrush, with which instrument, on occasions of ceremony,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) lubricates such thin locks as remain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) life of
severe study, Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a
foundation to work upon, together with tea, eggs, toast, and
marmalade on a corresponding scale. Having much enjoyed these
strengthening matters and having held subtle conference with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
familiar demon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) confidently instructs Mercury <div class="bookquote">``just to mention
quietly to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s ready
for me, I'm ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A gracious message being returned that
Sir Leicester will expedite his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) dressing and join Mr. Bucket in the
library within ten minutes, Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and
stands before the fire with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) chin, looking at the
blazing coals.

<p/>Thoughtful Mr. Bucket is, as a man may be with weighty work to do,
but composed, sure, confident. From the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
might be a famous whist-player for a large stake--say a hundred
guineas certain--with the game in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand, but with a high
reputation involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) playing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand out to the last card in a
masterly way. Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket
when Sir Leicester appears, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes the baronet aside as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) comes
slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) easy-chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in
which there might have been yesterday, but for the audacity of the
idea, a touch of compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to have kept you waiting, officer, but I am rather later
than my usual hour this morning. I am not well. The agitation and the
indignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much
for me. I am subject to--gout'' (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>--Sir Leicester was going to say
indisposition and would have said it to anybody else, but Mr. Bucket
palpably knows all about it--<div class="bookquote">``and recent circumstances have brought
it on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain,
Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer, standing with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) large
hands on the library-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not aware, officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester observes; raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``whether you wish us to be alone, but that is entirely
as you please. If you do, well and good. If not, Miss Dedlock would
be interested--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
head persuasively on one side and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) forefinger pendant at one ear
like an earring, <div class="bookquote">``we can't be too private just at present. You will
presently see that we can't be too private. A lady, under the
circumstances, and especially in Miss Dedlock's elevated station of
society, can't but be agreeable to me, but speaking without a view to
myself, I will take the liberty of assuring you that I know we can't
be too private.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much so, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket resumes,
<div class="bookquote">``that I was on the point of asking your permission to turn the key in
the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket skilfully and softly takes that
precaution, stooping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knee for a moment from mere force of
habit so to adjust the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in
from the outerside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I mentioned yesterday evening that I
wanted but a very little to complete this case. I have now completed
it and collected proof against the person who did this crime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Against the soldier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Sir Leicester Dedlock; not the soldier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester looks astounded and inquires, <div class="bookquote">``Is the man in custody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>), after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``It was a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester leans back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) chair, and breathlessly ejaculates,
<div class="bookquote">``Good heaven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket begins, standing
over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with one hand spread out on the library-table and the
forefinger of the other in impressive use, <div class="bookquote">``it's my duty to prepare
you for a train of circumstances that may, and I go so far as to say
that will, give you a shock. But Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, you
are a gentleman, and I know what a gentleman is and what a gentleman
is capable of. A gentleman can bear a shock when it must come, boldly
and steadily. A gentleman can make up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind to stand up against
almost any blow. Why, take yourself, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.
If there's a blow to be inflicted on you, you naturally think of your
family. You ask yourself, how would all them ancestors of yours, away
to Julius Caesar--not to go beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) at present--have borne that
blow; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well; and
you bear it well on their accounts, and to maintain the family
credit. That's the way you argue, and that's the way you act, Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) chair and grasping the elbows,
sits looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with a stony face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>proceeds Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``thus preparing
you, let me beg of you not to trouble your mind for a moment as to
anything having come to MY knowledge. I know so much about so many
characters, high and low, that a piece of information more or less
don't signify a straw. I don't suppose there's a move on the board
that would surprise ME, and as to this or that move having taken
place, why my knowing it is no odds at all, any possible move
whatever -LRB-provided it's in a wrong direction-RRB- being a probable move
according to my experience. Therefore, what I say to you, Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, is, don't you go and let yourself be put
out of the way because of my knowing anything of your family
affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you for your preparation,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Sir Leicester after a
silence, without moving hand, foot, or feature, <div class="bookquote">``which I hope is not
necessary; though I give it credit for being well intended. Be so
good as to go on. Also'' (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>--Sir Leicester seems to shrink in the shadow
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) figure--<div class="bookquote">``also, to take a seat, if you have no objection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>None at all. Mr. Bucket brings a chair and diminishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shadow.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, with this short preface I come
to the point. Lady Dedlock--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester raises himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seat and stares at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fiercely.
Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an emollient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, you see she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s universally admired. That's what her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
ladyship is; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s universally admired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would greatly prefer, officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester returns stiffly, <div class="bookquote">``my
Lady's name being entirely omitted from this discussion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would I, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, but--it's impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) relentless head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it's altogether impossible. What I
have got to say is about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is the pivot it all turns
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lip</b></font>)</div>retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a quivering
lip, <div class="bookquote">``you know your duty. Do your duty, but be careful not to
overstep it. I would not suffer it. I would not endure it. You bring
my Lady's name into this communication upon your responsibility--upon
your responsibility. My Lady's name is not a name for common persons
to trifle with!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lip</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I say what I must say, and no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it may prove so. Very well. Go on. Go on, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Glancing at
the angry eyes which now avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) and at the angry figure trembling
from head to foot, yet striving to be still, Mr. Bucket feels his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) way
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) forefinger and in a low voice proceeds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it becomes my duty to tell you that
the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long entertained mistrusts and
suspicions of Lady Dedlock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had dared to breathe them to me, sir--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) never did--I
would have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Leicester</b></font>)</div>exclaims Sir Leicester, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Leicester</b></font>)
hand upon the table. But in the very heat and fury of the act he (<font color='blue'><b>Leicester</b></font>)
stops, fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket, whose forefinger is
slowly going and who, with mingled confidence and patience, shakes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was deep and
close, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) fully had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) mind in the very beginning I
can't quite take upon myself to say. But I know from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) lips that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
long ago suspected Lady Dedlock of having discovered, through the
sight of some handwriting--in this very house, and when you yourself,
Sir Leicester Dedlock, were present--the existence, in great poverty,
of a certain person who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) lover before you courted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) and
who ought to have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket stops and
deliberately repeats, <div class="bookquote">``Ought to have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) husband, not a doubt
about it. I know from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips that when that person soon afterwards
died, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) suspected Lady Dedlock of visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wretched lodging and
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wretched grave, alone and in secret. I know from my own inquiries
and through my eyes and ears that Lady Dedlock did make such visit in
the dress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) own maid, for the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn employed
me to reckon up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship--if you'll excuse my making use of the
term we commonly employ--and I reckoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) up, so far, completely. I
confronted the maid in the chambers in Lincoln's Inn Fields with a
witness who had been Lady Dedlock's guide, and there couldn't be the
shadow of a doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) had worn the young woman's dress, unknown
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>). Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I did endeavour to pave the
way a little towards these unpleasant disclosures yesterday by saying
that very strange things happened even in high families sometimes.
All this, and more, has happened in your own family, and to and
through your own Lady. It's my belief that the deceased Mr.
Tulkinghorn followed up these inquiries to the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) death and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) and Lady Dedlock even had bad blood between them upon the
matter that very night. Now, only you put that to Lady Dedlock, Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship whether, even after
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had left here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) didn't go down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chambers with the
intention of saying something further to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), dressed in a loose
black mantle with a deep fringe to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester sits like a statue, gazing at the cruel finger that is
probing the life-blood of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You put that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, from
me, Inspector Bucket of the Detective. And if her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship makes any
difficulty about admitting of it, you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) that it's no use, that
Inspector Bucket knows it and knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) passed the soldier as
you called him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)'s not in the army now-RRB- and knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) on the staircase. Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock,
Baronet, why do I relate all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester, who has covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hands, uttering a
single groan, requests him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to pause for a moment. By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) takes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hands away, and so preserves his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) dignity and outward calmness,
though there is no more colour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) white hair,
that Mr. Bucket is a little awed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Something frozen and fixed
is upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) manner, over and above its usual shell of haughtiness,
and Mr. Bucket soon detects an unusual slowness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) speech, with
now and then a curious trouble in beginning, which occasions him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to
utter inarticulate sounds. With such sounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) now breaks silence,
soon, however, controlling himself to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) does not comprehend
why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late Mr. Tulkinghorn
should have communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) nothing of this painful, this
distressing, this unlooked-for, this overwhelming, this incredible
intelligence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``put it
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship to clear that up. Put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship, if you
think it right, from Inspector Bucket of the Detective. You'll find,
or I'm much mistaken, that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the
intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) considered
it ripe, and further, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) ladyship so to
understand. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) might have been going to reveal it the very
morning when I examined the body! You don't know what I'm going to
say and do five minutes from this present time, Sir Leicester
Dedlock, Baronet; and supposing I was to be picked off now, you might
wonder why I hadn't done it, don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>True. Sir Leicester, avoiding, with some trouble those obtrusive
sounds, says, <div class="bookquote">``True.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At this juncture a considerable noise of voices
is heard in the hall. Mr. Bucket, after listening, goes to the
library-door, softly unlocks and opens it, and listens again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
draws in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head and whispers hurriedly but composedly, <div class="bookquote">``Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, this unfortunate family affair has taken
air, as I expected it might, the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn being cut
down so sudden. The chance to hush it is to let in these people now
in a wrangle with your footmen. Would you mind sitting quiet--on the
family account--while I reckon 'em up? And would you just throw in a
nod when I seem to ask you for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester indistinctly answers, <div class="bookquote">``Officer. The best you can, the
best you can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Bucket, with a nod and a sagacious crook of
the forefinger, slips down into the hall, where the voices quickly
die away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is not long in returning; a few paces ahead of Mercury
and a brother deity also powdered and in peach-blossomed smalls, who
bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man. Another
man and two women come behind. Directing the pitching of the chair in
an affable and easy manner, Mr. Bucket dismisses the Mercuries and
locks the door again. Sir Leicester looks on at this invasion of the
sacred precincts with an icy stare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, perhaps you may know me, ladies and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket
in a confidential voice. <div class="bookquote">``I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective, I
am; and this,''  (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div>producing the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) convenient little staff from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) breast-pocket, <div class="bookquote">``is my authority. Now, you wanted to see Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet. Well! You do see him (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>), and mind you, it
ain't every one as is admitted to that honour. Your name, old

 (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and you never heard any harm of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Smallweed in a
shrill loud voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't happen to know why they killed the pig, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>retorts
Mr. Bucket with a steadfast look, but without loss of temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, they killed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) having so
much cheek. Don't YOU get into the same position, because it isn't
worthy of you. You ain't in the habit of conversing with a deaf
person, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>snarls Mr. Smallweed, <div class="bookquote">``my wife's deaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That accounts for your pitching your voice so high. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ain't
here; just pitch it an octave or two lower, will you, and I'll not
only be obliged to you, but it'll do you more credit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``This other gentleman is in the preaching line, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Name of Chadband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Smallweed puts in, speaking henceforth in a
much lower key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once had a friend and brother serjeant of the same name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``and consequently feel a liking for it.
Mrs. Chadband, no doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Smallweed introduces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Husband a law-stationer and a friend of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.
<div class="bookquote">``Love him (<font color='blue'><b>Husband</b></font>) like a brother! Now, what's up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean what business have we come upon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Smallweed asks, a
little dashed by the suddenness of this turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! You know what I mean. Let us hear what it's all about in
presence of Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet. Come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed, beckoning Mr. Chadband, takes a moment's counsel with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) in a whisper. Mr. Chadband, expressing a considerable amount of
oil from the pores of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) forehead and the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) hands, says
aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Yes. You first!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>and retires to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) former place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was the client and friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div>pipes Grandfather
Smallweed then; <div class="bookquote">``I did business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>). I was useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
was useful to me. Krook, dead and gone, was my brother-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) was
own brother to a brimstone magpie--leastways Mrs. Smallweed. I come
into Krook's property. I examined all his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) papers and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) effects.
They was all dug out under my eyes. There was a bundle of letters
belonging to a dead and gone lodger as was hid away at the back of a
shelf in the side of Lady Jane's bed--his (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) cat's bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krook</b></font>) hid all
manner of things away, everywheres. Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted 'em and
got 'em, but I looked 'em over first. I'm a man of business, and I
took a squint at 'em. They was letters from the lodger's sweetheart,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) signed Honoria. Dear me, that's not a common name, Honoria,
is it? There's no lady in this house that signs Honoria is there? Oh,
no, I don't think so! Oh, no, I don't think so! And not in the same
hand, perhaps? Oh, no, I don't think so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Smallweed, seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
triumph, breaks off to ejaculate, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me! Oh, Lord! I'm shaken
all to pieces!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, when you're ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket after awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
recovery, <div class="bookquote">``to come to anything that concerns Sir Leicester Dedlock,
Baronet, here the gentleman sits, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't I come to it, Mr. Bucket?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)</div>cries Grandfather Smallweed.
<div class="bookquote">``Isn't the gentleman concerned yet? Not with Captain Hawdon, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
ever affectionate Honoria, and their child into the bargain? Come,
then, I want to know where those letters are. That concerns me, if it
don't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock. I will know where they are. I
won't have 'em disappear so quietly. I handed 'em over to my friend
and solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, not to anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) paid you for them, you know, and handsome too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for that. I want to know who's got 'em. And I tell you
what we want--what we all here want, Mr. Bucket. We want more
painstaking and search-making into this murder. We know where the
interest and the motive was, and you have not done enough. If George
the vagabond dragoon had any hand in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was only an accomplice,
and was set on. You know what I mean as well as any man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, instantaneously altering his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
manner, coming close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), and communicating an extraordinary
fascination to the forefinger, <div class="bookquote">``I am damned if I am a-going to have
my case spoilt, or interfered with, or anticipated by so much as half
a second of time by any human being in creation. YOU want more
painstaking and search-making! YOU do? Do you see this hand, and do
you think that I don't know the right time to stretch it out and put
it on the arm that fired that shot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Such is the dread power of the man, and so terribly evident it is
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes no idle boast, that Mr. Smallweed begins to apologize.
Mr. Bucket, dismissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sudden anger, checks him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The advice I give you is, don't you trouble your head about the
murder. That's my affair. You keep half an eye on the newspapers, and
I shouldn't wonder if you was to read something about it before long,
if you look sharp. I know my business, and that's all I've got to say
to you on that subject. Now about those letters. You want to know
who's got 'em. I don't mind telling you. I have got 'em. Is that the
packet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed looks, with greedy eyes, at the little bundle Mr.
Bucket produces from a mysterious part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) coat, and identifies it
as the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you got to say next?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Now, don't open
your mouth too wide, because you don't look handsome when you do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want five hundred pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you don't; you mean fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket humorously.

<p/>It appears, however, that Mr. Smallweed means five hundred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, I am deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to consider
-LRB-without admitting or promising anything-RRB- this bit of business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says
Mr. Bucket--Sir Leicester mechanically bows his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head--<div class="bookquote">``and you ask me
to consider a proposal of five hundred pounds. Why, it's an
unreasonable proposal! Two fifty would be bad enough, but better than
that. Hadn't you better say two fifty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed is quite clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) had better not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``let's hear Mr. Chadband. Lord! Many a time
I've heard my old fellow-serjeant of that name; and a moderate man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was in all respects, as ever I come across!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus invited, Mr. Chadband steps forth, and after a little sleek
smiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hands,
delivers himself as follows, <div class="bookquote">``My friends, we are now--Rachael, my
wife, and I--in the mansions of the rich and great. Why are we now in
the mansions of the rich and great, my friends? Is it because we are
invited? Because we are bidden to feast with them, because we are
bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play the lute
with them, because we are bidden to dance with them? No. Then why are
we here, my friends? Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and do
we require corn, and wine, and oil, or what is much the same thing,
money, for the keeping thereof? Probably so, my friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a man of business, you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, very
attentive, <div class="bookquote">``and consequently you're going on to mention what the
nature of your secret is. You are right. You couldn't do better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us then, my brother, in a spirit of love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Chadband
with a cunning eye, <div class="bookquote">``proceed unto it. Rachael, my wife, advance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chadband/Chadband</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Chadband, more than ready, so advances as to jostle her (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) husband
into the background and confronts Mr. Bucket with a hard, frowning
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you want to know what we know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you. I
helped to bring up Miss Hawdon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) ladyship's daughter. I was in the
service of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) ladyship's sister, who was very sensitive to the
disgrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) ladyship brought upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), and gave out, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)
ladyship, that the child was dead--she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) WAS very nearly so--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)
was born. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)'s alive, and I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With these words, and a
laugh, and laying a bitter stress on the word <div class="bookquote">``ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Chadband folds her (<font color='blue'><b>Chadband</b></font>) arms and looks implacably at Mr. Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose now,''  (<font color='red'><b>officer</b></font>)</div>returns that officer, <div class="bookquote">``YOU will be expecting a
twenty-pound note or a present of about that figure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>officer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) can
<div class="bookquote">``offer''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>twenty pence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend the law-stationer's good lady, over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket, luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger. <div class="bookquote">``What may YOUR
game be, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby is at first prevented, by tears and lamentations, from
stating the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) game, but by degrees it confusedly comes to
light that she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) is a woman overwhelmed with injuries and wrongs, whom
Mr. Snagsby has habitually deceived, abandoned, and sought to keep in
darkness, and whose chief comfort, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) afflictions, has been
the sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn, who showed so much
commiseration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) on one occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) calling in Cook's Court
in the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) perjured husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) has of late
habitually carried to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) woes. Everybody it appears, the
present company excepted, has plotted against Mrs. Snagsby's peace.
There is Mr. Guppy, clerk to Kenge and Carboy, who was at first as
open as the sun at noon, but who suddenly shut up as close as
midnight, under the influence--no doubt--of Mr. Snagsby's suborning
and tampering. There is Mr. Weevle, friend of Mr. Guppy, who lived
mysteriously up a court, owing to the like coherent causes. There was
Krook, deceased; there was Nimrod, deceased; and there was Jo,
deceased; and they were <div class="bookquote">``all in it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>In what, Mrs. Snagsby does not
with particularity express, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby's
son, <div class="bookquote">``as well as if a trumpet had spoken it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo Snagsby son</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) followed Mr.
Snagsby when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) last visit to the boy, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) was not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) son why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) go? The one occupation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) life has been, for
some time back, to follow Mr. Snagsby to and fro, and up and down,
and to piece suspicious circumstances together--and every
circumstance that has happened has been most suspicious; and in this
way she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) object of detecting and confounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) false
husband, night and day. Thus did it come to pass that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) brought the
Chadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together, and conferred with Mr.
Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy, and helped to turn up the
circumstances in which the present company are interested, casually,
by the wayside, being still and ever on the great high road that is
to terminate in Mr. Snagsby's full exposure and a matrimonial
separation. All this, Mrs. Snagsby, as an injured woman, and the
friend of Mrs. Chadband, and the follower of Mr. Chadband, and the
mourner of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn, is here to certify under the
seal of confidence, with every possible confusion and involvement
possible and impossible, having no pecuniary motive whatever, no
scheme or project but the one mentioned, and bringing here, and
taking everywhere, her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) own dense atmosphere of dust, arising from the
ceaseless working of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) mill of jealousy.

<p/>While this exordium is in hand--and it takes some time--Mr. Bucket,
who has seen through the transparency of Mrs. Snagsby's vinegar at a
glance, confers with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) familiar demon and bestows his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) shrewd
attention on the Chadbands and Mr. Smallweed. Sir Leicester Dedlock
remains immovable, with the same icy surface upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>), except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>)
once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket, as relying on that officer
alone of all mankind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Now I understand you, you know, and
being deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to look into this
little matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>again Sir Leicester mechanically bows in confirmation
of the statement, <div class="bookquote">``can give it my fair and full attention. Now I
won't allude to conspiring to extort money or anything of that sort,
because we are men and women of the world here, and our object is to
make things pleasant. But I tell you what I DO wonder at; I am
surprised that you should think of making a noise below in the hall.
It was so opposed to your interests. That's what I look at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We wanted to get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>pleads Mr. Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course you wanted to get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket asserts with
cheerfulness; <div class="bookquote">``but for a old gentleman at your time of life--what I
call truly venerable, mind you!--with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wits sharpened, as I have
no doubt they are, by the loss of the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) limbs, which
occasions all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) animation to mount up into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, not to
consider that if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) don't keep such a business as the present as
close as possible it can't be worth a mag to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), is so curious! You
see your temper got the better of you; that's where you lost ground,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket in an argumentative and friendly way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only said I wouldn't go without one of the servants came up to Sir
Leicester Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it! That's where your temper got the better of you. Now, you
keep it under another time and you'll make money by it. Shall I ring
for them to carry you down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When are we to hear more of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Chadband</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Chadband sternly demands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless your heart for a true woman! Always curious, your delightful
sex is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have the
pleasure of giving you a call to-morrow or next day--not forgetting
Mr. Smallweed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) proposal of two fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five hundred!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>exclaims Mr. Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right! Nominally five hundred.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket has his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand on the
bell-rope. <div class="bookquote">``SHALL I wish you good day for the present on the part of
myself and the gentleman of the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) asks in an insinuating
tone.

<p/>Nobody having the hardihood to object to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) doing so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) does it,
and the party retire as they came up. Mr. Bucket follows them to the
door, and returning, says with an air of serious business, <div class="bookquote">``Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it's for you to consider whether or not
to buy this up. I should recommend, on the whole, it's being bought
up myself; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap. You see, that
little pickled cowcumber of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides
of the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and
ends together than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) had meant it. Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>)
held all these horses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) hand and could have drove 'em his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) own
way, I haven't a doubt; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) was fetched off the box head-foremost,
and now they have got their legs over the traces, and are all
dragging and pulling their own ways. So it is, and such is life. The
cat's away, and the mice they play; the frost breaks up, and the
water runs. Now, with regard to the party to be apprehended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester seems to wake, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes have been wide open, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looks intently at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The party to be apprehended is now in this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>proceeds Mr.
Bucket, putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) watch with a steady hand and with rising
spirits, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm about to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) into custody in your presence.
Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, don't you say a word nor yet stir.
There'll be no noise and no disturbance at all. I'll come back in the
course of the evening, if agreeable to you, and endeavour to meet
your wishes respecting this unfortunate family matter and the
nobbiest way of keeping it quiet. Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock,
Baronet, don't you be nervous on account of the apprehension at
present coming off. You shall see the whole case clear, from first to
last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket rings, goes to the door, briefly whispers Mercury, shuts
the door, and stands behind it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arms folded. After a suspense
of a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters.
Mademoiselle Hortense.

<p/>The moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) is in the room Mr. Bucket claps the door to and puts
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) back against it. The suddenness of the noise occasions her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) to
turn, and then for the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) sees Sir Leicester Dedlock in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask you pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) mutters hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``They tell me there was no
one here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) step towards the door brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) front to front with Mr. Bucket.
Suddenly a spasm shoots across her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) face and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) turns deadly pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my lodger, Sir Leicester Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, nodding
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks
back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do Sir Leicester care for that, you think, my angel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns
mademoiselle in a jocular strain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``we shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Hortense eyes him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with a scowl upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) tight face,
which gradually changes into a smile of scorn, <div class="bookquote">``You are very
mysterieuse. Are you drunk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tolerable sober, my angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife.
Your wife have left me since some minutes. They tell me downstairs
that your wife is here. I come here, and your wife is not here. What
is the intention of this fool's play, say then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>mademoiselle
demands, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) arms composedly crossed, but with something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)
dark cheek beating like a clock.

<p/>Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my God, you are an unhappy idiot!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries mademoiselle with a
toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) head and a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me to pass downstairs, great
pig.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With a stamp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) foot and a menace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way, <div class="bookquote">``you
go and sit down upon that sofy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not sit down upon nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) replies with a shower of
nods.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>repeats Mr. Bucket, making no demonstration
except with the finger, <div class="bookquote">``you sit down upon that sofy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I take you into custody on a charge of murder, and you don't
need to be told it. Now, I want to be polite to one of your sex and a
foreigner if I can. If I can't, I must be rough, and there's rougher
ones outside. What I am to be depends on you. So I recommend you, as
a friend, afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your
head, to go and sit down upon that sofy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle complies, saying in a concentrated voice while that
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) cheek beats fast and hard, <div class="bookquote">``You are a devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket proceeds approvingly, <div class="bookquote">``you're comfortable
and conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of
your sense to do. So I'll give you a piece of advice, and it's this,
don't you talk too much. You're not expected to say anything here,
and you can't keep too quiet a tongue in your head. In short, the
less you PARLAY, the better, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket is very complacent
over this French explanation.

<p/>Mademoiselle, with that tigerish expansion of the mouth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) black
eyes darting fire upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), sits upright on the sofa in a rigid
state, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) hands clenched--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) feet too, one might
suppose--muttering, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you Bucket, you are a devil!''

going on like that before Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is a poor abused!''

foreigner also angrily took it into her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had established
a claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, by attending on the occasion
I told you of at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) chambers, though she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was liberally paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)

Leicester Dedlock, with any deliberate intention then of doing this
deed and blinding me, I give no opinion on; but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lived in my house
in that capacity at the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was hovering about the chambers
of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn with a view to a wrangle, and
likewise persecuting and half frightening the life out of an
unfortunate stationer.''

know under what circumstances. Now, I beg of you to follow me close
with your attention for a minute or two. I was sent for, and the case
was entrusted to me. I examined the place, and the body, and the
papers, and everything. From information I received -LRB-from a clerk in
the same house-RRB- I took George into custody as having been seen
hanging about there on the night, and at very nigh the time of the
murder, also as having been overheard in high words with the deceased
on former occasions--even threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), as the witness made out.
If you ask me, Sir Leicester Dedlock, whether from the first I
believed George to be the murderer, I tell you candidly no, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
might be, notwithstanding, and there was enough against him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to make
it my duty to take him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and get him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) kept under remand. Now, observe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement--for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)--and
inaugurates what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is going to say with one ghostly beat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
forefinger in the air, Mademoiselle Hortense fixes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) black eyes
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with a dark frown and sets her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) dry lips closely and firmly
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went home, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, at night and found this
young woman having supper with my wife, Mrs. Bucket. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made a
mighty show of being fond of Mrs. Bucket from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first offering
herself as our lodger, but that night she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) made more than ever--in
fact, overdid it. Likewise she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) overdid her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) respect, and all that, for
the lamented memory of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn. By the living
Lord it flashed upon me, as I sat opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at the table and
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with a knife in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle is hardly audible in straining through her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) teeth and

artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult;
and I laid a trap for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--such a trap as I never laid yet, and such
a venture as I never made yet. I worked it out in my mind while I was
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at supper. When I went upstairs to bed, our house
being small and this young woman's ears sharp, I stuffed the sheet
into Mrs. Bucket's mouth that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shouldn't say a word of surprise
and told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) all about it. My dear, don't you give your mind to that
again, or I shall link your feet together at the ankles.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket,
breaking off, has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) heavy hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with you now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket with admonitory
finger, <div class="bookquote">``of throwing yourself out of window. That's what's the matter
with me. Come! Just take my arm. You needn't get up; I'll sit down by
you. Now take my arm, will you? I'm a married man, you know; you're
acquainted with my wife. Just take my arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Vainly endeavouring to moisten those dry lips, with a painful sound
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) struggles with herself and complies.

<p/>``Now we're all right again. Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, this case
could never have been the case it is but for Mrs. Bucket, who is a
woman in fifty thousand--in a hundred and fifty thousand! To throw
this young woman off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) guard, I have never set foot in our house
since, though I've communicated with Mrs. Bucket in the baker's
loaves and in the milk as often as required. My whispered words to
Mrs. Bucket when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the sheet in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth were, ``My dear, can
you throw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions
against George, and this, and that, and t`other? Can you do without
rest and keep watch upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) night and day? Can you undertake to say,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shall do nothing without my knowledge, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shall be my prisoner

death, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life shall be my life, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul my soul, till I
have got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did this murder?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bucket says to me, as
well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) could speak on account of the sheet, <div class="bookquote">``Bucket, I can!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) has acted up to it glorious!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lies!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>mademoiselle interposes. <div class="bookquote">``All lies, my friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, how did my calculations come out
under these circumstances? When I calculated that this impetuous
young woman would overdo it in new directions, was I wrong or right?
I was right. What does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) try to do? Don't let it give you a turn?
To throw the murder on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester rises from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) chair and staggers down again.

<p/>``And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got encouragement in it from hearing that I was always here,
which was done a-purpose. Now, open that pocket-book of mine, Sir
Leicester Dedlock, if I may take the liberty of throwing it towards
you, and look at the letters sent to me, each with the two words
``Lady Dedlock' in it. Open the one directed to yourself, which I
stopped this very morning, and read the three words <div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock,
Murderess' in it. These letters have been falling about like a shower
of lady-birds. What do you say now to Mrs. Bucket, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) spy-place
having seen them all `written by this young woman? What do you say to
Mrs. Bucket having, within this half-hour, secured the corresponding
ink and paper, fellow half-sheets and what not? What do you say to
Mrs. Bucket having watched the posting of 'em every one by this young
woman, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket asks, triumphant
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) lady's genius.

<p/>Two things are especially observable as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a
conclusion. First, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seems imperceptibly to establish a
dreadful right of property in mademoiselle. Secondly, that the very
atmosphere she (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) breathes seems to narrow and contract about her (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) as if
a close net or a pall were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around
her (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) breathless figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship was on the spot at the eventful
period,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``and my foreign friend here saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), I
believe, from the upper part of the staircase. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship and
George and my foreign friend were all pretty close on one another's
heels. But that don't signify any more, so I'll not go into it. I
found the wadding of the pistol with which the deceased Mr.
Tulkinghorn was shot. It was a bit of the printed description of your
house at Chesney Wold. Not much in that, you'll say, Sir Leicester
Dedlock, Baronet. No. But when my foreign friend here is so
thoroughly off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) guard as to think it a safe time to tear up the
rest of that leaf, and when Mrs. Bucket puts the pieces together and
finds the wadding wanting, it begins to look like Queer Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are very long lies,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>mademoiselle interposes. <div class="bookquote">``You prose great
deal. Is it that you have almost all finished, or are you speaking
always?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>proceeds Mr. Bucket, who delights
in a full title and does violence to himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) dispenses with
any fragment of it, <div class="bookquote">``the last point in the case which I am now going
to mention shows the necessity of patience in our business, and never
doing a thing in a hurry. I watched this young woman yesterday
without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knowledge when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was looking at the funeral, in company
with my wife, who planned to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) there; and I had so much to
convict her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and I saw such an expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and my mind so
rose against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) malice towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship, and the time was
altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call
retribution upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that if I had been a younger hand with less
experience, I should have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), certain. Equally, last night,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship, as is so universally admired I am sure, come home
looking--why, Lord, a man might almost say like Venus rising from the
ocean--it was so unpleasant and inconsistent to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being
charged with a murder of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was innocent that I felt quite to
want to put an end to the job. What should I have lost? Sir Leicester
Dedlock, Baronet, I should have lost the weapon. My prisoner here
proposed to Mrs. Bucket, after the departure of the funeral, that
they should go per bus a little ways into the country and take tea at
a very decent house of entertainment. Now, near that house of
entertainment there's a piece of water. At tea, my prisoner got up to
fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket handkercher from the bedroom where the bonnets was;
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind.
As soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket,
along with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) observations and suspicions. I had the piece of water
dragged by moonlight, in presence of a couple of our men, and the
pocket pistol was brought up before it had been there half-a-dozen
hours. Now, my dear, put your arm a little further through mine, and
hold it steady, and I shan't hurt you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In a trice Mr. Bucket snaps a handcuff on her (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) wrist. <div class="bookquote">``That's one,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Now the other, darling. Two, and all told!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) rises; she (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) rises too. <div class="bookquote">``Where,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), darkening her (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) large
eyes until their drooping lids almost conceal them--and yet they
stare, <div class="bookquote">``where is your false, your treacherous, and cursed wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s gone forrard to the Police Office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returns Mr. Bucket.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would like to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div>exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense, panting
tigress-like.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd bite her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>making her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) eyes very large. <div class="bookquote">``I would love to tear her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) limb
from limb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure,
<div class="bookquote">``I'm fully prepared to hear that. Your sex have such a surprising
animosity against one another when you do differ. You don't mind me
half so much, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Though you are a devil still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel and devil by turns, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``But I am in my
regular employment, you must consider. Let me put your shawl tidy.
I've been lady's maid to a good many before now. Anything wanting to
the bonnet? There's a cab at the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Hortense/Mademoiselle/Hortense</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Hortense, casting an indignant eye at the glass, shakes
herself perfectly neat in one shake and looks, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) justice,
uncommonly genteel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen then, my angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) after several sarcastic nods. <div class="bookquote">``You
are very spiritual. But can you restore him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) back to life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket answers, <div class="bookquote">``Not exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is droll. Listen yet one time. You are very spiritual. Can you
make a honourable lady of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be so malicious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or a haughty gentleman of HIM?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries mademoiselle, referring to Sir
Leicester with ineffable disdain. <div class="bookquote">``Eh! Oh, then regard him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)! The poor
infant! Ha! Ha! Ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, why this is worse PARLAYING than the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Come along!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot do these things? Then you can do as you please with me.
It is but the death, it is all the same. Let us go, my angel. Adieu,
you old man, grey. I pity you, and I despise you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With these last words she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) snaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) teeth together as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) mouth
closed with a spring. It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket
gets her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) out, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar
to himself, enfolding and pervading her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) like a cloud, and hovering
away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) were a homely Jupiter and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) the object of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) affections.

<p/>Sir Leicester, left alone, remains in the same attitude, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
were still listening and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) attention were still occupied. At length
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) gazes round the empty room, and finding it deserted, rises
unsteadily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) feet, pushes back his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) chair, and walks a few steps,
supporting himself by the table. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) stops, and with more of
those inarticulate sounds, lifts up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) eyes and seems to stare at
something.

<p/>Heaven knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) sees. The green, green woods of Chesney Wold,
the noble house, the pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) forefathers, strangers defacing
them, officers of police coarsely handling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) most precious
heirlooms, thousands of fingers pointing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>), thousands of faces
sneering at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>). But if such shadows flit before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>)
bewilderment, there is one other shadow which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) can name with
something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) addresses
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) tearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) white hair and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) extended arms.

<p/>It is she (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) in association with whom, saving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) has been for
years a main fibre of the root of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) dignity and pride, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) has never
had a selfish thought. It is she (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) has loved, admired,
honoured, and set up for the world to respect. It is she (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) who, at the
core of all the constrained formalities and conventionalities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>)
life, has been a stock of living tenderness and love, susceptible as
nothing else is of being struck with the agony he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) feels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>),
almost to the exclusion of himself, and cannot bear to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>)
cast down from the high place she (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) has graced so well.

<p/>And even to the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) sinking on the ground, oblivious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>)
suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) can yet pronounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) name with something like
distinctness in the midst of those intrusive sounds, and in a tone of
mourning and compassion rather than reproach.




<p/>CHAPTER LV

<p/>Flight


<p/>Inspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Detective</b></font>) great blow,
as just now chronicled, but is yet refreshing himself with sleep
preparatory to his (<font color='blue'><b>Detective</b></font>) field-day, when through the night and along the
freezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire,
making its way towards London.

<p/>Railroads shall soon traverse all this country, and with a rattle and
a glare the engine and train shall shoot like a meteor over the wide
night-landscape, turning the moon paler; but as yet such things are
non-existent in these parts, though not wholly unexpected.
Preparations are afoot, measurements are made, ground is staked out.
Bridges are begun, and their not yet united piers desolately look at
one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar couples with
an obstacle to their union; fragments of embankments are thrown up
and left as precipices with torrents of rusty carts and barrows
tumbling over them; tripods of tall poles appear on hilltops, where
there are rumours of tunnels; everything looks chaotic and abandoned
in full hopelessness. Along the freezing roads, and through the
night, the post-chaise makes its way without a railroad on its mind.

<p/>Mrs. Rouncewell, so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold, sits
within the chaise; and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) grey
cloak and umbrella. The old girl would prefer the bar in front, as
being exposed to the weather and a primitive sort of perch more in
accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) usual course of travelling, but Mrs. Rouncewell
is too thoughtful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) comfort to admit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) proposing it. The
old lady cannot make enough of the old girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sits, in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stately
manner, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, and regardless of its roughness, puts it
often to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``You are a mother, my dear soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) many
times, <div class="bookquote">``and you found out my George's mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>returns Mrs. Bagnet, <div class="bookquote">``was always free with me, ma'am,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things
my Woolwich could have to think of when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grew to be a man, the
comfortablest would be that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had never brought a sorrowful line
into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's face or turned a hair of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head grey, then I felt
sure, from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way, that something fresh had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own mother
into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind. I had often known him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) say to me, in past times, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had behaved bad to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>returns Mrs. Rouncewell, bursting into tears. <div class="bookquote">``My
blessing on him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), never! He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was always fond of me, and loving to me,
was my George! But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a bold spirit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ran a little wild and
went for a soldier. And I know he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) waited at first, in letting us know
about himself, till he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should rise to be an officer; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
didn't rise, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) considered himself beneath us, and wouldn't be
a disgrace to us. For he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a lion heart, had my George, always from
a baby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady's hands stray about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) as of yore, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) recalls,
all in a tremble, what a likely lad, what a fine lad, what a gay
good-humoured clever lad he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was; how they all took to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) down at
Chesney Wold; how Sir Leicester took to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) was a young
gentleman; how the dogs took to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>); how even the people who had been
angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) was gone, poor boy. And now
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) after all, and in a prison too! And the broad stomacher
heaves, and the quaint upright old-fashioned figure bends under its
load of affectionate distress.

<p/>Mrs. Bagnet, with the instinctive skill of a good warm heart, leaves
the old housekeeper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) emotions for a little while--not without
passing the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) hand across her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) own motherly eyes--and
presently chirps up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) cheery manner, ``So I says to George when I
goes to call him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in to tea -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pretended to be smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe
outside-RRB-, ``What ails you this afternoon, George, for gracious sake? I
have seen all sorts, and I have seen you pretty often in season and
out of season, abroad and at home, and I never see you so melancholy
penitent.'' ``Why, Mrs. Bagnet,<div class="bookquote">'' says George, `it's because I AM
melancholy and penitent both, this afternoon, that you see me so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What have you done, old fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mrs. Bagnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>says
George, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head, `what I have done has been done this many a
long year, and is best not tried to be undone now. If I ever get to
heaven it won't be for being a good son to a widowed mother; I say no
more.'' Now, ma'am, when George says to me that it's best not tried to
be undone now, I have my thoughts as I have often had before, and I
draw it out of George how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comes to have such things on him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that
afternoon. Then George tells me that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has seen by chance, at the
lawyer's office, a fine old lady that has brought his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother plain
before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) runs on about that old lady till he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) quite forgets
himself and paints her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) picture to me as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to be, years upon
years back. So I says to George when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has done, who is this old
lady he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has seen? And George tells me it's Mrs. Rouncewell,
housekeeper for more than half a century to the Dedlock family down
at Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire. George has frequently told me before
that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s a Lincolnshire man, and I says to my old Lignum that night,
<div class="bookquote">``Lignum, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother for five and for-ty pound!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the twentieth time at least
within the last four hours. Trilling it out like a kind of bird, with
a pretty high note, that it may be audible to the old lady above the
hum of the wheels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, and thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell. <div class="bookquote">``Bless you, and
thank you, my worthy soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner. <div class="bookquote">``No
thanks to me, I am sure. Thanks to yourself, ma'am, for being so
ready to pay 'em! And mind once more, ma'am, what you had best do
on finding George to be your own son is to make him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--for your
sake--have every sort of help to put himself in the right and clear
himself of a charge of which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is as innocent as you or me. It won't
do to have truth and justice on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) side; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must have law and
lawyers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>exclaims the old girl, apparently persuaded that the latter
form a separate establishment and have dissolved partnership with
truth and justice for ever and a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shall have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Rouncewell, <div class="bookquote">``all the help that can be got
for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in the world, my dear. I will spend all I have, and
thankfully, to procure it. Sir Leicester will do his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) best, the whole
family will do their best. I--I know something, my dear; and will
make my own appeal, as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) all these years,
and finding him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in a jail at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/>The extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper's manner in saying
this, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) broken words, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) wringing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) hands make a powerful
impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) refers
them all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) sorrow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) son's condition. And yet Mrs. Bagnet
wonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so distractedly, <div class="bookquote">``My
Lady, my Lady, my Lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>over and over again.

<p/>The frosty night wears away, and the dawn breaks, and the post-chaise
comes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise
departed. It has plenty of spectral company in ghosts of trees and
hedges, slowly vanishing and giving place to the realities of day.
London reached, the travellers alight, the old housekeeper in great
tribulation and confusion, Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected--as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) would be if her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) next point, with no new equipage and outfit, were
the Cape of Good Hope, the Island of Ascension, Hong Kong, or any
other military station.

<p/>But when they set out for the prison where the trooper is
confined, the old lady has managed to draw about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
lavender-coloured dress, much of the staid calmness which is its
usual accompaniment. A wonderfully grave, precise, and handsome piece
of old china she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looks, though her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart beats fast and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stomacher
is ruffled more than even the remembrance of this wayward son has
ruffled it these many years.

<p/>Approaching the cell, they find the door opening and a warder in the
act of coming out. The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to
him (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) to say nothing; assenting with a nod, he (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) suffers them to enter as
he (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) shuts the door.

<p/>So George, who is writing at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) table, supposing himself to be
alone, does not raise his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes, but remains absorbed. The old
housekeeper looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and those wandering hands of hers are quite
enough for Mrs. Bagnet's confirmation, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) could see the
mother and the son together, knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) knows, and doubt their
relationship.

<p/>Not a rustle of the housekeeper's dress, not a gesture, not a word
betrays her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) stands looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) writes on, all
unconscious, and only her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) fluttering hands give utterance to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
emotions. But they are very eloquent, very, very eloquent. Mrs.
Bagnet understands them. They speak of gratitude, of joy, of grief,
of hope; of inextinguishable affection, cherished with no return
since this stalwart man was a stripling; of a better son loved less,
and this son loved so fondly and so proudly; and they speak in such
touching language that Mrs. Bagnet's eyes brim up with tears and they
run glistening down her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) sun-brown face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George Rouncewell! Oh, my dear child, turn and look at me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper starts up, clasps his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) mother round the neck, and falls
down on his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) knees before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>). Whether in a late repentance, whether
in the first association that comes back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) hands
together as a child does when it says its prayers, and raising them
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) breast, bows down his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head, and cries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My George, my dearest son! Always my favourite, and my favourite
still, where have you been these cruel years and years? Grown such a
man too, grown such a fine strong man. Grown so like what I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
must be, if it pleased God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was alive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) can ask, and he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) can answer, nothing connected for a time. All
that time the old girl, turned away, leans one arm against the
whitened wall, leans her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) honest forehead upon it, wipes her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) serviceable grey cloak, and quite enjoys herself like the best of
old girls as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper when they are more composed, <div class="bookquote">``forgive me
first of all, for I know my need of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>Forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart and soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always has
done it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has had it written in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will, these
many years, that he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beloved son George. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has never
believed any ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), never. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had died without this
happiness--and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is an old woman now and can't look to live very
long--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) last breath, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had had
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) senses, as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beloved son George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, I have been an undutiful trouble to you, and I have my
reward; but of late years I have had a kind of glimmering of a
purpose in me too. When I left home I didn't care much, mother--I am
afraid not a great deal--for leaving; and went away and `listed,
harum-scarum, making believe to think that I cared for nobody, no not
I, and that nobody cared for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper has dried his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) eyes and put away his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) handkerchief, but
there is an extraordinary contrast between his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) habitual manner of
expressing himself and carrying himself and the softened tone in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) speaks, interrupted occasionally by a half-stifled sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I wrote a line home, mother, as you too well know, to say I had
`listed under another name, and I went abroad. Abroad, at one time I
thought I would write home next year, when I might be better off; and
when that year was out, I thought I would write home next year, when
I might be better off; and when that year was out again, perhaps I
didn't think much about it. So on, from year to year, through a
service of ten years, till I began to get older, and to ask myself
why should I ever write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't find any fault, child--but not to ease my mind, George? Not
a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>This almost overturns the trooper afresh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) sets himself up with
a great, rough, sounding clearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forgive me, mother, but I thought there would be small
consolation then in hearing anything about me. There were you,
respected and esteemed. There was my brother, as I read in chance
North Country papers now and then, rising to be prosperous and
famous. There was I a dragoon, roving, unsettled, not self-made like
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), but self-unmade--all my earlier advantages thrown away, all my
little learning unlearnt, nothing picked up but what unfitted me for
most things that I could think of. What business had I to make myself
known? After letting all that time go by me, what good could come of
it? The worst was past with you, mother. I knew by that time -LRB-being a
man-RRB- how you had mourned for me, and wept for me, and prayed for me;
and the pain was over, or was softened down, and I was better in your
mind as it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady sorrowfully shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and taking one of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
powerful hands, lays it lovingly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>``No, I don't say that it was so, mother, but that I made it out to be
so. I said just now, what good could come of it? Well, my dear
mother, some good might have come of it to myself--and there was the
meanness of it. You would have sought me out; you would have
purchased my discharge; you would have taken me down to Chesney Wold;
you would have brought me and my brother and my brother's family
together; you would all have considered anxiously how to do something
for me and set me up as a respectable civilian. But how could any of
you feel sure of me when I couldn't so much as feel sure of myself?
How could you help regarding as an incumbrance and a discredit to you
an idle dragooning chap who was an incumbrance and a discredit to
himself, excepting under discipline? How could I look my brother's
children in the face and pretend to set them an example--I, the
vagabond boy who had run away from home and been the grief and
unhappiness of my mother's life? ``No, George.'' Such were my words,
mother, when I passed this in review before me: <div class="bookquote">``You have made your
bed. Now, lie upon it.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rouncewell, drawing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) stately form, shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) head at the
old girl with a swelling pride upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>), as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``I told
you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The old girl relieves her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feelings and testifies her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke
between the shoulders with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) umbrella; this action she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) afterwards
repeats, at intervals, in a species of affectionate lunacy, never
failing, after the administration of each of these remonstrances, to
resort to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This was the way I brought myself to think, mother, that my best
amends was to lie upon that bed I had made, and die upon it. And I
should have done it -LRB-though I have been to see you more than once
down at Chesney Wold, when you little thought of me-RRB- but for my old
comrade's wife here, who I find has been too many for me. But I thank
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for it. I thank you for it, Mrs. Bagnet, with all my heart and
might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>To which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes.

<p/>And now the old lady impresses upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son George, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own dear
recovered boy, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) joy and pride, the light of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, the happy
close of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life, and every fond name she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can think of, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must
be governed by the best advice obtainable by money and influence,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must yield up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) case to the greatest lawyers that can be
got, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must act in this serious plight as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shall be advised
to act and must not be self-willed, however right, but must promise
to think only of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) poor old mother's anxiety and suffering until he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
is released, or he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will break her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, `tis little enough to consent to,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper,
stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with a kiss; <div class="bookquote">``tell me what I shall do, and I'll make a
late beginning and do it. Mrs. Bagnet, you'll take care of my mother,
I know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>A very hard poke from the old girl's umbrella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) will find them of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) way of thinking, and they will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) the
best advice and assistance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the old lady, <div class="bookquote">``we must send with all haste for
your brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a sensible sound man as they tell me--out in the
world beyond Chesney Wold, my dear, though I don't know much of it
myself--and will be of great service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper, <div class="bookquote">``is it too soon to ask a favour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely not, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then grant me this one great favour. Don't let my brother know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not know what, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not know of me. In fact, mother, I can't bear it; I can't make up my
mind to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has proved himself so different from me and has done
so much to raise himself while I've been soldiering that I haven't
brass enough in my composition to see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in this place and under
this charge. How could a man like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be expected to have any
pleasure in such a discovery? It's impossible. No, keep my secret
from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), mother; do me a greater kindness than I deserve and keep my
secret from my brother, of all men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not always, dear George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, mother, perhaps not for good and all--though I may come to ask
that too--but keep it now, I do entreat you. If it's ever broke to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rip of a brother has turned up, I could wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the
trooper, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head very doubtfully, <div class="bookquote">``to break it myself and be
governed as to advancing or retreating by the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) seems
to take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) evidently has a rooted feeling on this point, and as the depth
of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet's face, his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) mother yields her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
implicit assent to what he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) asks. For this he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) thanks her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In all other respects, my dear mother, I'll be as tractable and
obedient as you can wish; on this one alone, I stand out. So now I am

his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) writing on the table, <div class="bookquote">``an exact account of what I knew of the

on end, whensoever I was called upon to say anything in my defence. I
hope I may be let to do it still; but I have no longer a will of my
own in this case, and whatever is said or done, I give my promise not
to have any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass, and time
being on the wane, Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure. Again and again
the old lady hangs upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's neck, and again and again the
trooper holds her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) broad chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to take my mother, Mrs. Bagnet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to the town house, my dear, the family house. I have some

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you see my mother safe there in a coach, Mrs. Bagnet? But of

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bagnet/Bagnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Why indeed, Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>), my old friend, and take my gratitude along with you.
Kisses to Quebec and Malta, love to my godson, a hearty shake of the
hand to Lignum, and this for yourself, and I wish it was ten thousand
pound in gold, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>So saying, the trooper puts his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) lips to the
old girl's tanned forehead, and the door shuts upon him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) cell.

<p/>No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce
Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bagnet</b></font>) own conveyance home. Jumping
out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and handing Mrs.
Rouncewell up the steps, the old girl shakes hands and trudges off,
arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and
falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened.

<p/>My Lady is in that room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) last conference with
the murdered man, and is sitting where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sat that night, and is
looking at the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood upon the hearth studying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) so
leisurely, when a tap comes at the door. Who is it? Mrs. Rouncewell.
What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble, my Lady. Sad trouble. Oh, my Lady, may I beg a word with
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>this woman</b></font>)</div><p/>What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble
so? Far happier than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Lady, as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Lady has often thought, why
does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) falter in this manner and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with such strange
mistrust?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter? Sit down and take your breath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my Lady, my Lady. I have found my son--my youngest, who went
away for a soldier so long ago. And he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) is in prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For debt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, my Lady; I would have paid any debt, and joyful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what is he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) in prison then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charged with a murder, my Lady, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) is as innocent as--as I
am. Accused of the murder of Mr. Tulkinghorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mean by this look and this imploring gesture? Why does
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come so close? What is the letter that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) holds?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock, my dear Lady, my good Lady, my kind Lady! You must
have a heart to feel for me, you must have a heart to forgive me. I
was in this family before you were born. I am devoted to it. But
think of my dear son wrongfully accused.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my Lady, no. But others do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is in prison and in danger.
Oh, Lady Dedlock, if you can say but a word to help to clear him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), say
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What delusion can this be? What power does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suppose is in the
person she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) petitions to avert this unjust suspicion, if it be unjust?
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Lady's handsome eyes regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) with astonishment, almost with
fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady, I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my son in
my old age, and the step upon the Ghost's Walk was so constant and so
solemn that I never heard the like in all these years. Night after
night, as it has fallen dark, the sound has echoed through your
rooms, but last night it was awfullest. And as it fell dark last
night, my Lady, I got this letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What letter is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div>The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened
whisper, <div class="bookquote">``My Lady, I have not breathed a word of it, I don't believe
what's written in it, I know it can't be true, I am sure and certain
that it is not true. But my son is in danger, and you must have a
heart to pity me. If you know of anything that is not known to
others, if you have any suspicion, if you have any clue at all, and
any reason for keeping it in your own breast, oh, my dear Lady, think
of me, and conquer that reason, and let it be known! This is the most
I consider possible. I know you are not a hard lady, but you go your
own way always without help, and you are not familiar with your
friends; and all who admire you--and all do--as a beautiful and
elegant lady, know you to be one far away from themselves who can't
be approached close. My Lady, you may have some proud or angry
reasons for disdaining to utter something that you know; if so, pray,
oh, pray, think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been
passed in this family which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dearly loves, and relent, and help to
clear my son! My Lady, my good Lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div>the old housekeeper pleads with
genuine simplicity, <div class="bookquote">``I am so humble in my place and you are by nature
so high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child,
but I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg
and pray you not to be scornful of us if you can do us any right or
justice at this fearful time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Dedlock raises her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) without one word, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) takes the letter
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to read this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I am gone, my Lady, if you please, and then remembering the
most that I consider possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know of nothing I can do. I know of nothing I reserve that can
affect your son. I have never accused him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady, you may pity him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the more under a false accusation after
reading the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The old housekeeper leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) with the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hand. In truth
she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is not a hard lady naturally, and the time has been when the
sight of the venerable figure suing to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with such strong
earnestness would have moved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to great compassion. But so long
accustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality, so long
schooled for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own purposes in that destructive school which shuts
up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads
one uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad, the feeling and
the unfeeling, the sensible and the senseless, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had subdued even
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wonder until now.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) opens the letter. Spread out upon the paper is a printed account
of the discovery of the body as it lay face downward on the floor,
shot through the heart; and underneath is written her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own name, with
the word <div class="bookquote">``murderess''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>attached.

<p/>It falls out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand. How long it may have lain upon the ground
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows not, but it lies where it fell when a servant stands before
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) announcing the young man of the name of Guppy. The words have
probably been repeated several times, for they are ringing in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
head before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) begins to understand them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) come in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) comes in. Holding the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has taken from
the floor, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tries to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thoughts. In the eyes of Mr.
Guppy she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is the same Lady Dedlock, holding the same prepared, proud,
chilling state.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship may not be at first disposed to excuse this visit from
one who has never been welcome to your ladyship'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) don't
complain of, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is bound to confess that there never has been any
particular reason on the face of things why he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) should be--<div class="bookquote">``but I hope
when I mention my motives to your ladyship you will not find fault

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank your ladyship. I ought first to explain to your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Guppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hat on the carpet at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``that Miss Summerson, whose image, as I formerly mentioned

whatever in any manner at all relating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>). And Miss Summerson's
wishes being to me a law -LRB-except as connected with circumstances over
which I have no control-RRB-, I consequently never expected to have the
distinguished honour of waiting on your ladyship again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is here now, Lady Dedlock moodily reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet I am here now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy admits. <div class="bookquote">``My object being to

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) cannot do so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), too plainly or too briefly. <div class="bookquote">``Nor can
I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``too
particularly request your ladyship to take particular notice that
it's no personal affair of mine that brings me here. I have no
interested views of my own to serve in coming here. If it was not for
my promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of it sacred--I, in point
of fact, shouldn't have darkened these doors again, but should have
seen 'em further first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hair
with both hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship will remember when I mention it that the last time I
was here I run against a party very eminent in our profession and
whose loss we all deplore. That party certainly did from that time
apply himself to cutting in against me in a way that I will call
sharp practice, and did make it, at every turn and point, extremely
difficult for me to be sure that I hadn't inadvertently led up to
something contrary to Miss Summerson's wishes. Self-praise is no
recommendation, but I may say for myself that I am not so bad a man
of business neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dedlock/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Dedlock looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) in stern inquiry. Mr. Guppy immediately
withdraws his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) face and looks anywhere else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, it has been made so hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) goes on, <div class="bookquote">``to have any idea
what that party was up to in combination with others that until the
loss which we all deplore I was gravelled--an expression which your
ladyship, moving in the higher circles, will be so good as to
consider tantamount to knocked over. Small likewise--a name by which
I refer to another party, a friend of mine that your ladyship is not
acquainted with--got to be so close and double-faced that at times it
wasn't easy to keep one's hands off his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) `ead. However, what with the
exertion of my humble abilities, and what with the help of a mutual
friend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle -LRB-who is of a high aristocratic
turn and has your ladyship's portrait always hanging up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) room-RRB-,
I have now reasons for an apprehension as to which I come to put your
ladyship upon your guard. First, will your ladyship allow me to ask
you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning? I don't
mean fashionable visitors, but such visitors, for instance, as Miss
Barbary's old servant, or as a person without the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) lower
extremities, carried upstairs similarly to a guy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I assure your ladyship that such visitors have been here and
have been received here. Because I saw them at the door, and waited
at the corner of the square till they came out, and took half an
hour's turn afterwards to avoid them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I to do with that, or what have you? I do not understand
you. What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship, I come to put you on your guard. There may be no
occasion for it. Very well. Then I have only done my best to keep my
promise to Miss Summerson. I strongly suspect -LRB-from what Small has
dropped, and from what we have corkscrewed out of him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)-RRB- that those
letters I was to have brought to your ladyship were not destroyed
when I supposed they were. That if there was anything to be blown
upon, it IS blown upon. That the visitors I have alluded to have been
here this morning to make money of it. And that the money is made, or
making.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy picks up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) hat and rises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship, you know best whether there's anything in what I say
or whether there's nothing. Something or nothing, I have acted up to
Miss Summerson's wishes in letting things alone and in undoing what I
had begun to do, as far as possible; that's sufficient for me. In
case I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your
guard when there's no necessity for it, you will endeavour, I should
hope, to outlive my presumption, and I shall endeavour to outlive
your disapprobation. I now take my farewell of your ladyship, and
assure you that there's no danger of your ever being waited on by me
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) scarcely acknowledges these parting words by any look, but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has been gone a little while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) rings her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Sir Leicester?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mercury reports that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) is at present shut up in the library alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Sir Leicester had any visitors this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Several, on business. Mercury proceeds to a description of them,
which has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy. Enough; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) may go.

<p/>So! All is broken down. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) name is in these many mouths, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) husband
knows his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wrongs, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shame will be published--may be spreading while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) thinks about it--and in addition to the thunderbolt so long
foreseen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), so unforeseen by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is denounced by an
invisible accuser as the murderess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) enemy.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) enemy he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has often, often, often wished him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dead.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) enemy he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) grave. This dreadful accusation comes
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) like a new torment at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lifeless hand. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
recalls how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) was secretly at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) door that night, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) may
be represented to have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) favourite girl away so soon before
merely to release herself from observation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shudders as if the
hangman's hands were at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) neck.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has thrown herself upon the floor and lies with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hair all
wildly scattered and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) face buried in the cushions of a couch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
rises up, hurries to and fro, flings herself down again, and rocks
and moans. The horror that is upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is unutterable. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) really
were the murderess, it could hardly be, for the moment, more intense.

<p/>For as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) murderous perspective, before the doing of the deed,
however subtle the precautions for its commission, would have been
closed up by a gigantic dilatation of the hateful figure, preventing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) from seeing any consequences beyond it; and as those consequences
would have rushed in, in an unimagined flood, the moment the figure
was laid low--which always happens when a murder is done; so, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
sees that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) used to be on the watch before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) used to
think, <div class="bookquote">``if some mortal stroke would but fall on this old man and take
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from my way!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>it was but wishing that all he (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) held against her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hand might be flung to the winds and chance-sown in many places.
So, too, with the wicked relief she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) death. What was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) death but the key-stone of a gloomy arch removed, and now the
arch begins to fall in a thousand fragments, each crushing and
mangling piecemeal!

<p/>Thus, a terrible impression steals upon and overshadows her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) that from
this pursuer, living or dead--obdurate and imperturbable before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) well-remembered shape, or not more obdurate and imperturbable
in his (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) coffin-bed--there is no escape but in death. Hunted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
flies. The complication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) shame, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) dread, remorse, and misery,
overwhelms her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) at its height; and even her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) strength of self-reliance
is overturned and whirled away like a leaf before a mighty wind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) hurriedly addresses these lines to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) husband, seals, and leaves
them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) table:


<p/>If I am sought for, or accused of, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) murder, believe
that I am wholly innocent. Believe no other good of me,
for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard,
or will hear, laid to my charge. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) prepared me, on that
fatal night, for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) disclosure of my guilt to you. After
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left me, I went out on pretence of walking in the
garden where I sometimes walk, but really to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
and make one last petition that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not protract the
dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), you
do not know how long, but would mercifully strike next
morning.

<p/>I found his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) house dark and silent. I rang twice at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
door, but there was no reply, and I came home.

<p/>I have no home left. I will encumber you no more. May
you, in your just resentment, be able to forget the
unworthy woman on whom you have wasted a most generous
devotion--who avoids you only with a deeper shame than
that with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurries from herself--and who writes
this last adieu.


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) veils and dresses quickly, leaves all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jewels and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money,
listens, goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty, opens
and shuts the great door, flutters away in the shrill frosty wind.




<p/>CHAPTER LVI

<p/>Pursuit


<p/>Impassive, as behoves its high breeding, the Dedlock town house
stares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives
no outward sign of anything going wrong within. Carriages rattle,
doors are battered at, the world exchanges calls; ancient charmers
with skeleton throats and peachy cheeks that have a rather ghastly
bloom upon them seen by daylight, when indeed these fascinating
creatures look like Death and the Lady fused together, dazzle the
eyes of men. Forth from the frigid mews come easily swinging
carriages guided by short-legged coachmen in flaxen wigs, deep sunk
into downy hammercloths, and up behind mount luscious Mercuries
bearing sticks of state and wearing cocked hats broadwise, a
spectacle for the angels.

<p/>The Dedlock town house changes not externally, and hours pass before
its exalted dullness is disturbed within. But Volumnia the fair,
being subject to the prevalent complaint of boredom and finding that
disorder attacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) spirits with some virulence, ventures at
length to repair to the library for change of scene. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gentle
tapping at the door producing no response, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) opens it and peeps in;
seeing no one there, takes possession.

<p/>The sprightly Dedlock is reputed, in that grass-grown city of the
ancients, Bath, to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with
a golden glass at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) eye, peering into objects of every description.
Certain it is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) avails herself of the present opportunity of
hovering over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) kinsman's letters and papers like a bird, taking a
short peck at this document and a blink with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head on one side at
that document, and hopping about from table to table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) glass
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) eye in an inquisitive and restless manner. In the course of
these researches she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) stumbles over something, and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) glass
in that direction, sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) kinsman lying on the ground like a felled
tree.

<p/>Volumnia's pet little scream acquires a considerable augmentation of
reality from this surprise, and the house is quickly in commotion.
Servants tear up and down stairs, bells are violently rung, doctors
are sent for, and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions, but not
found. Nobody has seen or heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) last rang her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) bell. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)
letter to Sir Leicester is discovered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) table, but it is
doubtful yet whether he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) has not received another missive from another
world requiring to be personally answered, and all the living
languages, and all the dead, are as one to him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>).

<p/>They lay him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) bed, and chafe, and rub, and fan, and put
ice to his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) head, and try every means of restoration. Howbeit, the day
has ebbed away, and it is night in his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) room before his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) stertorous
breathing lulls or his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) fixed eyes show any consciousness of the
candle that is occasionally passed before them. But when this change
begins, it goes on; and by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) nods or moves his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) eyes or even
his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) hand in token that he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) hears and comprehends.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) fell down, this morning, a handsome stately gentleman, somewhat
infirm, but of a fine presence, and with a well-filled face. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) lies
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) bed, an aged man with sunken cheeks, the decrepit shadow of
himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) voice was rich and mellow and he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) had so long been
thoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word
he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) said that his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) words really had come to sound as if there were
something in them. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) can only whisper, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) whispers
sounds like what it is--mere jumble and jargon.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) bedside. It is
the first act he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) notices, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) clearly derives pleasure from it.
After vainly trying to make himself understood in speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) makes
signs for a pencil. So inexpressively that they cannot at first
understand him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>); it is his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) old housekeeper who makes out what he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) wants
and brings in a slate.

<p/>After pausing for some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) slowly scrawls upon it in a hand that
is not his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Chesney Wold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) is in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) was taken ill in the library
this morning. Right thankful she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) happened to come to
London and is able to attend upon him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not an illness of any serious consequence, Sir Leicester. You
will be much better to-morrow, Sir Leicester. All the gentlemen say
so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This, with the tears coursing down her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) fair old face.

<p/>After making a survey of the room and looking with particular
attention all round the bed where the doctors stand, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) writes, <div class="bookquote">``My
Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady went out, Sir Leicester, before you were taken ill, and
don't know of your illness yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) points again, in great agitation, at the two words. They all try
to quiet him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) points again with increased agitation. On their
looking at one another, not knowing what to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) takes the slate
once more and writes <div class="bookquote">``My Lady. For God's sake, where?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And makes an
imploring moan.

<p/>It is thought better that his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) old housekeeper should give him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) Lady
Dedlock's letter, the contents of which no one knows or can surmise.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) opens it for him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) and puts it out for his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) perusal. Having read it
twice by a great effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) turns it down so that it shall not be
seen and lies moaning. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) passes into a kind of relapse or into a
swoon, and it is an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) opens his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) eyes, reclining on his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
faithful and attached old servant's arm. The doctors know that he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) is
best with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), and when not actively engaged about him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>), stand aloof.

<p/>The slate comes into requisition again, but the word he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) wants to
write he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) cannot remember. His (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) anxiety, his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) eagerness, and affliction
at this pass are pitiable to behold. It seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) must go mad in
the necessity he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) feels for haste and the inability under which he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) has written the
letter B, and there stopped. Of a sudden, in the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
misery, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) puts Mr. before it. The old housekeeper suggests Bucket.
Thank heaven! That's his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) meaning.

<p/>Mr. Bucket is found to be downstairs, by appointment. Shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) come
up?

<p/>There is no possibility of misconstruing Sir Leicester's burning wish
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) or the desire he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) signifies to have the room cleared of
every one but the housekeeper. It is speedily done, and Mr. Bucket
appears. Of all men upon earth, Sir Leicester seems fallen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
high estate to place his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) sole trust and reliance upon this man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I'm sorry to see you like this. I
hope you'll cheer up. I'm sure you will, on account of the family
credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leicester Dedlock/Leicester/Dedlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester puts her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hands and looks intently in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
face while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) reads it. A new intelligence comes into Mr. Bucket's
eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) reads on; with one hook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) finger, while that eye is
still glancing over the words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) indicates, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock,
Baronet, I understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester writes upon the slate. <div class="bookquote">``Full forgiveness. Find--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Bucket stops his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). But my search after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) must be begun out of hand. Not a minute must be lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With the quickness of thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) follows Sir Leicester Dedlock's
look towards a little box upon a table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring it here, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet? Certainly. Open it
with one of these here keys? Certainly. The littlest key? TO be sure.
Take the notes out? So I will. Count 'em? That's soon done. Twenty
and thirty's fifty, and twenty's seventy, and fifty's one twenty, and
forty's one sixty. Take 'em for expenses? That I'll do, and render an
account of course. Don't spare money? No I won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>The velocity and certainty of Mr. Bucket's interpretation on all
these heads is little short of miraculous. Mrs. Rouncewell, who holds
the light, is giddy with the swiftness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes and hands as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
starts up, furnished for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're George's mother, old lady; that's about what you are, I
believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket aside, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hat already on and
buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I am his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) distressed mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``So I thought, according to what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mentioned to me just now. Well,
then, I'll tell you something. You needn't be distressed no more.
Your son's all right. Now, don't you begin a-crying, because what
you've got to do is to take care of Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,
and you won't do that by crying. As to your son, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s all right, I
tell you; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) loving duty, and hoping you're the same.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s discharged honourable; that's about what HE (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is; with no more
imputation on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) character than there is on yours, and yours is a
tidy one, I<div class="bookquote">``LL bet a pound. You may trust me, for I took your son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
conducted himself in a game way, too, on that occasion; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s a
fine-made man, and you're a fine-made old lady, and you're a mother
and son, the pair of you, as might be showed for models in a caravan.
Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, what you've trusted to me I'll go
through with. Don't you be afraid of my turning out of my way, right
or left, or taking a sleep, or a wash, or a shave till I have found
what I go in search of. Say everything as is kind and forgiving on
your part? Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I will. And I wish you
better, and these family affairs smoothed over--as, Lord, many other
family affairs equally has been, and equally will be, to the end of
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>With this peroration, Mr. Bucket, buttoned up, goes quietly out,
looking steadily before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) were already piercing the night
in quest of the fugitive.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock's rooms and look
all over them for any trifling indication that may help him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). The
rooms are in darkness now; and to see Mr. Bucket with a wax-light in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand, holding it above his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head and taking a sharp mental
inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with
himself, would be to see a sight--which nobody DOES see, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is
particular to lock himself in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A spicy boudoir, this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, who feels in a manner
furbished up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) French by the blow of the morning. <div class="bookquote">``Must have
cost a sight of money. Rum articles to cut away from, these; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must
have been hard put to it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Opening and shutting table-drawers and looking into caskets and
jewel-cases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) sees the reflection of himself in various mirrors,
and moralizes thereon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and
getting myself up for almac's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``I begin to think I
must be a swell in the Guards without knowing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ever looking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has opened a dainty little chest in an inner
drawer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) great hand, turning over some gloves which it can
scarcely feel, they are so light and soft within it, comes upon a
white handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum! Let's have a look at YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, putting down the
light. <div class="bookquote">``What should YOU be kept by yourself for? What's YOUR motive?
Are you her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ladyship's property, or somebody else's? You've got a
mark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) finds it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) speaks, <div class="bookquote">``Esther Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Bucket, pausing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) finger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``Come,
I'll take YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) completes his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) observations as quietly and carefully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has
carried them on, leaves everything else precisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) found it,
glides away after some five minutes in all, and passes into the
street. With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir
Leicester's room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sets off, full-swing, to the nearest
coach-stand, picks out the horse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) money, and directs to be
driven to the shooting gallery. Mr. Bucket does not claim to be a
scientific judge of horses, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) lays out a little money on the
principal events in that line, and generally sums up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knowledge of
the subject in the remark that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sees a horse as can go, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knowledge is not at fault in the present instance. Clattering
over the stones at a dangerous pace, yet thoughtfully bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
keen eyes to bear on every slinking creature whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) passes in the
midnight streets, and even on the lights in upper windows where
people are going or gone to bed, and on all the turnings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
rattles by, and alike on the heavy sky, and on the earth where the
snow lies thin--for something may present itself to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>),
anywhere--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) dashes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) destination at such a speed that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
stops the horse half smothers him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in a cloud of steam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unbear him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) half a moment to freshen him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) up, and I'll be back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I should, George, after what you have gone through, my
lad. I haven't a word to spare. Now, honour! All to save a woman.
Miss Summerson that was here when Gridley died--that was the name, I
know--all right--where does she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper has just come from there and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) the address, near
Oxford Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't repent it, George. Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is off again, with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by
the frosty fire staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) open-mouthed, and gallops away again,
and gets out in a cloud of steam again.

<p/>Mr. Jarndyce, the only person up in the house, is just going to bed,
rises from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell, and
comes down to the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) dressing-gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>In a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) visitor is confidential with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) in the hall, has shut the door, and stands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) hand upon the
lock. <div class="bookquote">``I've had the pleasure of seeing you before. Inspector Bucket.
Look at that handkerchief, sir, Miss Esther Summerson's. Found it
myself put away in a drawer of Lady Dedlock's, quarter of an hour
ago. Not a moment to lose. Matter of life or death. You know Lady
Dedlock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There has been a discovery there to-day. Family affairs have come
out. Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, has had a fit--apoplexy or
paralysis--and couldn't be brought to, and precious time has been

him (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) that looks bad. Run your eye over it. Here it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce, having read it, asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) thinks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. It looks like suicide. Anyways, there's more and more
danger, every minute, of its drawing to that. I'd give a hundred
pound an hour to have got the start of the present time. Now, Mr.
Jarndyce, I am employed by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to follow
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) and find her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) forgiveness. I have
money and full power, but I want something else. I want Miss
Summerson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jarndyce/Jarndyce</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Jarndyce'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Bucket has read his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) face with the greatest
attention all along--<div class="bookquote">``I speak to you as a gentleman of a humane
heart, and under such pressing circumstances as don't often happen.
If ever delay was dangerous, it's dangerous now; and if ever you
couldn't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it, this is the
time. Eight or ten hours, worth, as I tell you, a hundred pound
apiece at least, have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared. I am
charged to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>). I am Inspector Bucket. Besides all the rest
that's heavy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) has upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) believes, suspicion of
murder. If I follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), being in ignorance of what Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, has communicated to me, may be driven to
desperation. But if I follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) in company with a young lady,
answering to the description of a young lady that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has a
tenderness for--I ask no question, and I say no more than that--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
will give me credit for being friendly. Let me come up with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and
be able to have the hold upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of putting that young lady for`ard,
and I'll save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and prevail with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is alive. Let me come
up with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) alone--a hard matter--and I'll do my best, but I don't
answer for what the best may be. Time flies; it's getting on for one
o'clock. When one strikes, there's another hour gone, and it's worth
a thousand pound now instead of a hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>This is all true, and the pressing nature of the case cannot be
questioned. Mr. Jarndyce begs him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to remain there while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) speaks to
Miss Summerson. Mr. Bucket says he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) will, but acting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) usual
principle, does no such thing, following upstairs instead and keeping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) man in sight. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) remains, dodging and lurking about in the
gloom of the staircase while they confer. In a very little time Mr.
Jarndyce comes down and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) that Miss Summerson will join him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
directly and place herself under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) protection to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) pleases. Mr. Bucket, satisfied, expresses high approval and
awaits her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) coming at the door.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mounts a high tower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mind and looks out far and wide.
Many solitary figures he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) perceives creeping through the streets; many
solitary figures out on heaths, and roads, and lying under haystacks.
But the figure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seeks is not among them. Other solitaries he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
perceives, in nooks of bridges, looking over; and in shadowed places
down by the river's level; and a dark, dark, shapeless object
drifting with the tide, more solitary than all, clings with a
drowning hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) attention.

<p/>Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)? Living or dead, where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)? If, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) folds the
handkerchief and carefully puts it up, it were able with an enchanted
power to bring before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) found it and the
night-landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child,
would he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) descry her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) there? On the waste where the brick-kilns are
burning with a pale blue flare, where the straw-roofs of the wretched
huts in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind,
where the clay and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the
gaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of
human torture--traversing this deserted, blighted spot there is a
lonely figure with the sad world to itself, pelted by the snow and
driven by the wind, and cast out, it would seem, from all
companionship. It is the figure of a woman, too; but it is miserably
dressed, and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at
the great door of the Dedlock mansion.




<p/>CHAPTER LVII

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the
door of my room and begged me to get up directly. On my hurrying to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and learn what had happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) told me, after a word or
two of preparation, that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester
Dedlock's. That my mother had fled, that a person was now at our door
who was empowered to convey to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the fullest assurances of
affectionate protection and forgiveness if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) could possibly find
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that I was sought for to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in the hope that my
entreaties might prevail upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) if his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) failed. Something to this
general purpose I made out, but I was thrown into such a tumult of
alarm, and hurry and distress, that in spite of every effort I could
make to subdue my agitation, I did not seem, to myself, fully to
recover my right mind until hours had passed.

<p/>But I dressed and wrapped up expeditiously without waking Charley or
any one and went down to Mr. Bucket, who was the person entrusted
with the secret. In taking me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) my guardian told me this, and
also explained how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) had come to think of me. Mr.
Bucket, in a low voice, by the light of my guardian's candle, read to
me in the hall a letter that my mother had left upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) table; and I
suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), rolling swiftly through the streets.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) manner was very keen, and yet considerate when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) explained to me
that a great deal might depend on my being able to answer, without
confusion, a few questions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wished to ask me. These were,
chiefly, whether I had had much communication with my mother -LRB-to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) only referred as Lady Dedlock-RRB-, when and where I had spoken with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) last, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had become possessed of my handkerchief. When I
had satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) on these points, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) asked me particularly to
consider--taking time to think--whether within my knowledge there was
any one, no matter where, in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) might be at all likely to
confide under circumstances of the last necessity. I could think of
no one but my guardian. But by and by I mentioned Mr. Boythorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>)
came into my mind as connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) old chivalrous manner of
mentioning my mother's name and with what my guardian had informed me
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) engagement to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) unconscious connexion with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unhappy story.

<p/>My companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation,
that we might the better hear each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) now told him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to go on
again and said to me, after considering within himself for a few
moments, that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mind how to proceed. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was quite
willing to tell me what his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) plan was, but I did not feel clear enough
to understand it.

<p/>We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a
by-street at a public-looking place lighted up with gas. Mr. Bucket
took me in and sat me in an arm-chair by a bright fire. It was now
past one, as I saw by the clock against the wall. Two police
officers, looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like
people who were up all night, were quietly writing at a desk; and the
place seemed very quiet altogether, except for some beating and
calling out at distant doors underground, to which nobody paid any
attention.

<p/>A third man in uniform, whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
whispered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) instructions, went out; and then the two others advised
together while one wrote from Mr. Bucket's subdued dictation. It was
a description of my mother that they were busy with, for Mr. Bucket
brought it to me when it was done and read it in a whisper. It was
very accurate indeed.

<p/>The second officer, who had attended to it closely, then copied it
out and called in another man in uniform -LRB-there were several in an
outer room-RRB-, who took it up and went away with it. All this was done
with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment; yet
nobody was at all hurried. As soon as the paper was sent out upon its
travels, the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing
with neatness and care. Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the
soles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) boots, first one and then the other, at the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you well wrapped up, Miss Summerson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) asked me as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes
met mine. <div class="bookquote">``It's a desperate sharp night for a young lady to be out
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) I cared for no weather and was warmly clothed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be a long job,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) observed; <div class="bookquote">``but so that it ends well, never
mind, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I pray to heaven it may end well!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) nodded comfortingly. <div class="bookquote">``You see, whatever you do, don't you go and
fret yourself. You keep yourself cool and equal for anything that may
happen, and it'll be the better for you, the better for me, the
better for Lady Dedlock, and the better for Sir Leicester Dedlock,
Baronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was really very kind and gentle, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stood before the fire
warming his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) boots and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) forefinger, I felt a
confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sagacity which reassured me. It was not yet a
quarter to two when I heard horses' feet and wheels outside. <div class="bookquote">``Now,
Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we are off, if you please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arm, and the two officers courteously bowed me out,
and we found at the door a phaeton or barouche with a postilion and
post horses. Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own seat on the
box. The man in uniform whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sent to fetch this equipage then
handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up a dark lantern at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) request, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given a
few directions to the driver, we rattled away.

<p/>I was far from sure that I was not in a dream. We rattled with great
rapidity through such a labyrinth of streets that I soon lost all
idea where we were, except that we had crossed and re-crossed the
river, and still seemed to be traversing a low-lying, waterside,
dense neighbourhood of narrow thoroughfares chequered by docks and
basins, high piles of warehouses, swing-bridges, and masts of ships.
At length we stopped at the corner of a little slimy turning, which
the wind from the river, rushing up it, did not purify; and I saw my
companion, by the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lantern, in conference with several
men who looked like a mixture of police and sailors. Against the
mouldering wall by which they stood, there was a bill, on which I
could discern the words, <div class="bookquote">``Found Drowned'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; and this and an inscription
about drags possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in
our visit to that place.

<p/>I had no need to remind myself that I was not there by the indulgence
of any feeling of mine to increase the difficulties of the search, or
to lessen its hopes, or enhance its delays. I remained quiet, but
what I suffered in that dreadful spot I never can forget. And still
it was like the horror of a dream. A man yet dark and muddy, in long
swollen sodden boots and a hat like them, was called out of a boat
and whispered with Mr. Bucket, who went away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) down some
slippery steps--as if to look at something secret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) had to
show. They came back, wiping their hands upon their coats, after
turning over something wet; but thank God it was not what I feared!

<p/>After some further conference, Mr. Bucket -LRB-whom everybody seemed to
know and defer to-RRB- went in with the others at a door and left me in
the carriage, while the driver walked up and down by his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horses to
warm himself. The tide was coming in, as I judged from the sound it
made, and I could hear it break at the end of the alley with a little
rush towards me. It never did so--and I thought it did so, hundreds
of times, in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour, and
probably was less--but the thought shuddered through me that it would
cast my mother at the horses' feet.

<p/>Mr. Bucket came out again, exhorting the others to be vigilant,
darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) lantern, and once more took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you be
alarmed, Miss Summerson, on account of our coming down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
said, turning to me. <div class="bookquote">``I only want to have everything in train and to
know that it is in train by looking after it myself. Get on, my lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We appeared to retrace the way we had come. Not that I had taken note
of any particular objects in my perturbed state of mind, but judging
from the general character of the streets. We called at another
office or station for a minute and crossed the river again. During
the whole of this time, and during the whole search, my companion,
wrapped up on the box, never relaxed in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) vigilance a single
moment; but when we crossed the bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) seemed, if possible, to be
more on the alert than before. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stood up to look over the parapet,
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) alighted and went back after a shadowy female figure that flitted
past us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) gazed into the profound black pit of water with a
face that made my heart die within me. The river had a fearful look,
so overcast and secret, creeping away so fast between the low flat
lines of shore--so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes, both of
substance and shadow; so death-like and mysterious. I have seen it
many times since then, by sunlight and by moonlight, but never free
from the impressions of that journey. In my memory the lights upon
the bridge are always burning dim, the cutting wind is eddying round
the homeless woman whom we pass, the monotonous wheels are whirling
on, and the light of the carriage-lamps reflected back looks palely
in upon me--a face rising out of the dreaded water.

<p/>Clattering and clattering through the empty streets, we came at
length from the pavement on to dark smooth roads and began to leave
the houses behind us. After a while I recognized the familiar way to
Saint Albans. At Barnet fresh horses were ready for us, and we
changed and went on. It was very cold indeed, and the open country
was white with snow, though none was falling then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An old acquaintance of yours, this road, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bucket cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. <div class="bookquote">``Have you gathered any intelligence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None that can be quite depended on as yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``but it's
early times as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had gone into every late or early public-house where there
was a light -LRB-they were not a few at that time, the road being
then much frequented by drovers-RRB- and had got down to talk to the
turnpike-keepers. I had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) ordering drink, and chinking money,
and making himself agreeable and merry everywhere; but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seat upon the box again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face resumed its watchful
steady look, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) always said to the driver in the same business
tone, <div class="bookquote">``Get on, my lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div><p/>With all these stoppages, it was between five and six o'clock and we
were yet a few miles short of Saint Albans when he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) came out of one of
these houses and handed me in a cup of tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink it, Miss Summerson, it'll do you good. You're beginning to get
more yourself now, ain't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) and said I hoped so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was what you may call stunned at first,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) returned; <div class="bookquote">``and Lord,
no wonder! Don't speak loud, my dear. It's all right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)'s on
ahead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know what joyful exclamation I made or was going to make, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) finger and I stopped myself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Passed through here on foot this evening about eight or nine. I
heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) first at the archway toll, over at Highgate, but
couldn't make quite sure. Traced her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) all along, on and off. Picked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) up at one place, and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) at another; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)'s before us
now, safe. Take hold of this cup and saucer, ostler. Now, if you
wasn't brought up to the butter trade, look out and see if you can
catch half a crown in your t`other hand. One, two, three, and there
you are! Now, my lad, try a gallop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Saint</b></font>)</div><p/>We were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day, when I
was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the
night and really to believe that they were not a dream. Leaving the
carriage at the posting-house and ordering fresh horses to be ready,
my companion gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) arm, and we went towards home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As this is your regular abode, Miss Summerson, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
observed, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know whether you've been asked for by any
stranger answering the description, or whether Mr. Jarndyce has. I
don't much expect it, but it might be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As we ascended the hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) with a sharp eye--the
day was now breaking--and reminded me that I had come down it one
night, as I had reason for remembering, with my little servant and
poor Jo, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) called Toughey.

<p/>I wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you passed a man upon the road, just yonder, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Bucket.

<p/>Yes, I remembered that too, very well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket.

<p/>Seeing my surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I drove down in a gig that afternoon
to look after that boy. You might have heard my wheels when you came
out to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) yourself, for I was aware of you and your
little maid going up when I was walking the horse down. Making an
inquiry or two about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the town, I soon heard what company he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
was in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when I
observed you bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) home here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) committed any crime?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None was charged against him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, coolly lifting off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hat, <div class="bookquote">``but I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wasn't over-particular. No. What I wanted
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for was in connexion with keeping this very matter of Lady
Dedlock quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been making his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tongue more free than welcome
as to a small accidental service he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been paid for by the deceased
Mr. Tulkinghorn; and it wouldn't do, at any sort of price, to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) playing those games. So having warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) out of London, I made
an afternoon of it to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) to keep out of it now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) WAS away, and
go farther from it, and maintain a bright look-out that I didn't
catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) coming back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>assented Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``and trouble enough, and well
enough away from London, or anywhere else. I was regularly turned on
my back when I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) taken up by your establishment, I do assure
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) why. <div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Naturally there
was no end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) tongue then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) might as well have been born with a
yard and a half of it, and a remnant over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Although I remember this conversation now, my head was in confusion
at the time, and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me
to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) entered into these particulars to divert me.
With the same kind intention, manifestly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) often spoke to me of
indifferent things, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face was busy with the one object that
we had in view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) still pursued this subject as we turned in at the
garden-gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Here we are, and a nice retired place it is.
Puts a man in mind of the country house in the Woodpecker-tapping,
that was known by the smoke which so gracefully curled. They're early
with the kitchen fire, and that denotes good servants. But what
you've always got to be careful of with servants is who comes to see
'em; you never know what they're up to if you don't know that. And
another thing, my dear. Whenever you find a young man behind the
kitchen-door, you give that young man in charge on suspicion of being
secreted in a dwelling-house with an unlawful purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We were now in front of the house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looked attentively and closely
at the gravel for footprints before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes to the
windows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you generally put that elderly young gentleman in the same room
when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s on a visit here, Miss Summerson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) inquired, glancing at
Mr. Skimpole's usual chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Mr. Skimpole!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Bucket, bending down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
ear. <div class="bookquote">``Skimpole, is it? I've often wondered what his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) name might be.
Skimpole. Not John, I should say, nor yet Jacob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harold,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harold. Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harold</b></font>)'s a queer bird is Harold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, eyeing
me with great expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harold</b></font>) is a singular character,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No idea of money,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harold</b></font>) takes it, though!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I involuntarily returned for answer that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, now I'll tell you, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) replied. ``Your mind will
be all the better for not running on one point too continually, and
I'll tell you for a change. It was him (<font color='blue'><b>Harold</b></font>) as pointed out to me where
Toughey was. I made up my mind that night to come to the door and ask
for Toughey, if that was all; but willing to try a move or so first,
if any such was on the board, I just pitched up a morsel of gravel at
that window where I saw a shadow. As soon as Harold opens it and I
have had a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harold</b></font>), thinks I, you're the man for me. So I
smoothed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down a bit about not wanting to disturb the family after
they was gone to bed and about its being a thing to be regretted that
charitable young ladies should harbour vagrants; and then, when I
pretty well understood his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ways, I said I should consider a fypunnote
well bestowed if I could relieve the premises of Toughey without
causing any noise or trouble. Then says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyebrows
in the gayest way, ``It's no use mentioning a fypunnote to me, my
friend, because I'm a mere child in such matters and have no idea of
money.'' Of course I understood what his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) taking it so easy meant; and
being now quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was the man for me, I wrapped the note round
a little stone and threw it up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Well! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) laughs and beams, and
looks as innocent as you like, and says, ``But I don't know the value
of these things. What am I to DO with this?'' ``Spend it, sir,'' says I.
``But I shall be taken in,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) says, `they won't give me the right
change, I shall lose it, it's no use to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Lord, you never saw such
a face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) carried it with! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) told me where to find
Toughey, and I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).''

<p/>I regarded this as very treacherous on the part of Mr. Skimpole
towards my guardian and as passing the usual bounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) childish
innocence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bounds, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Bucket. ``Bounds? Now, Miss Summerson,
I'll give you a piece of advice that your husband will find useful
when you are happily married and have got a family about you.
Whenever a person says to you that they are as innocent as can be in
all concerning money, look well after your own money, for they are
dead certain to collar it if they can. Whenever a person proclaims to
you ``In worldly matters I'm a child,<div class="bookquote">'' you consider that that person
is only a-crying off from being held accountable and that you have
got that person's number, and it's Number One. Now, I am not a
poetical man myself, except in a vocal way when it goes round a
company, but I'm a practical one, and that's my experience. So's this
rule. Fast and loose in one thing, fast and loose in everything. I
never knew it fail. No more will you. Nor no one. With which caution
to the unwary, my dear, I take the liberty of pulling this here bell,
and so go back to our business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>I believe it had not been for a moment out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, any more than
it had been out of my mind, or out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. The whole household
were amazed to see me, without any notice, at that time in the
morning, and so accompanied; and their surprise was not diminished by
my inquiries. No one, however, had been there. It could not be
doubted that this was the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said my companion, <div class="bookquote">``we can't be too soon at
the cottage where those brickmakers are to be found. Most inquiries
there I leave to you, if you'll be so good as to make 'em. The
naturalest way is the best way, and the naturalest way is your own
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>We set off again immediately. On arriving at the cottage, we found it
shut up and apparently deserted, but one of the neighbours who knew
me and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear informed
me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in
another house, made of loose rough bricks, which stood on the margin
of the piece of ground where the kilns were and where the long rows
of bricks were drying. We lost no time in repairing to this place,
which was within a few hundred yards; and as the door stood ajar, I
pushed it open.

<p/>There were only three of them sitting at breakfast, the child lying
asleep on a bed in the corner. It was Jenny, the mother of the dead
child, who was absent. The other woman rose on seeing me; and the
men, though they were, as usual, sulky and silent, each gave me a
morose nod of recognition. A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket
followed me in, and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/>I had asked leave to enter of course. Liz -LRB-the only name by which I
knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>)-RRB- rose to give me her (<font color='blue'><b>Liz</b></font>) own chair, but I sat down on a stool
near the fire, and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead. Now that
I had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar, I
became conscious of being hurried and giddy. It was very difficult to
begin, and I could not help bursting into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Liz,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I have come a long way in the night and through the
snow to inquire after a lady--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has been here, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket struck in, addressing the
whole group with a composed propitiatory face; <div class="bookquote">``that's the lady the
young lady means. The lady that was here last night, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who told YOU as there was anybody here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny/Will Jenny</b></font>)</div>inquired Jenny's
husband, who had made a surly stop in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eating to listen and now
measured him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A person of the name of Michael Jackson, with a blue welveteen
waistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket
immediately answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) had as good mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) own business, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>growled the
man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)'s out of employment, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket apologetically
for Michael Jackson, <div class="bookquote">``and so gets talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael Jackson/Michael</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman had not resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair, but stood faltering with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hand upon its broken back, looking at me. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have
spoken to me privately if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had dared. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still in this
attitude of uncertainty when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, who was eating with a lump
of bread and fat in one hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) clasp-knife in the other, struck
the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knife violently on the table and told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with an
oath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to have seen Jenny very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``for I am sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) would have told me all she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could about this lady, whom I am very
anxious indeed--you cannot think how anxious--to overtake. Will Jenny
be here soon? Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman had a great desire to answer, but the man, with another
oath, openly kicked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavy boot. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left it to
Jenny's husband to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose, and after a dogged silence the
latter turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shaggy head towards me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not partial to gentlefolks coming into my place, as you've heerd
me say afore now, I think, miss. I let their places be, and it's
curious they can't let my place be. There'd be a pretty shine made if
I was to go a-wisitin THEM, I think. Howsoever, I don't so much
complain of you as of some others, and I'm agreeable to make you a
civil answer, though I give notice that I'm not a-going to be drawed
like a badger. Will Jenny be here soon? No she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) won't. Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s gone up to Lunnun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) go last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) go last night? Ah! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) went last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered with a
sulky jerk of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But was she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) here when the lady came? And what did the lady say to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? And where is the lady gone? I beg and pray you to be so kind as
to tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``for I am in great distress to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If my master would let me speak, and not say a word of harm--''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the
woman timidly began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your master,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, muttering an imprecation with slow
emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``will break your neck if you meddle with wot don't concern
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>After another silence, the husband of the absent woman, turning to me
again, answered me with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) usual grumbling unwillingness.

<p/>``Wos Jenny here when the lady come? Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) wos here when the lady
come. Wot did the lady say to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? Well, I'll tell you wot the lady
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, ``You remember me as come one time to talk to
you about the young lady as had been a-wisiting of you? You remember
me as give you somethink handsome for a handkercher wot she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
left?<div class="bookquote">'' Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembered. So we all did. Well, then, wos that young
lady up at the house now? No, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) warn't up at the house now. Well,
then, lookee here. The lady was upon a journey all alone, strange as
we might think it, and could she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rest herself where you're a setten
for a hour or so. Yes she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went--it
might be at twenty minutes past eleven, and it might be at twenty
minutes past twelve; we ain't got no watches here to know the time
by, nor yet clocks. Where did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) go? I don't know where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) go'd.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went one way, and Jenny went another; one went right to Lunnun,
and t`other went right from it. That's all about it. Ask this man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heerd it all, and see it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The other man repeated, <div class="bookquote">``That's all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man all</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was the lady crying?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Devil a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the first man. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoes was the worse, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) clothes was the worse, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) warn't--not as I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms crossed and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes upon the ground. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
husband had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seat a little so as to face her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
hammer-like hand upon the table as if it were in readiness to execute
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) threat if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disobeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will not object to my asking your wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``how the
lady looked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gruffly cried to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says. Cut
it short and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman. <div class="bookquote">``Pale and exhausted. Very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) speak much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much, but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice was hoarse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, looking all the while at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband for leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) faint?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eat or drink here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look. <div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and cut it
short.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a little water, miss, and Jenny fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) some bread and
tea. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hardly touched it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) went from here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was proceeding, when Jenny's husband
impatiently took me up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) went from here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) went right away nor`ard by the high
road. Ask on the road if you doubt me, and see if it warn't so. Now,
there's the end. That's all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I glanced at my companion, and finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had already risen and
was ready to depart, thanked them for what they had told me, and took
my leave. The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) went out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
looked full at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) said to me as we walked quickly away.
<div class="bookquote">``They've got her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) ladyship's watch among 'em. That's a positive fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as good as saw it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``Else why should he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) talk about
his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) `twenty minutes past' and about his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) having no watch to tell the
time by? Twenty minutes! He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) don't usually cut his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) time so fine as
that. If he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) comes to half-hours, it's as much as HE (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) does. Now, you
see, either her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) ladyship gave him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) that watch or he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) took it. I think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) gave it him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). Now, what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) give it him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) for? What should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) give it him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) repeated this question to himself several times as we hurried on,
appearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If time could be spared,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``which is the only thing
that can't be spared in this case, I might get it out of that woman;
but it's too doubtful a chance to trust to under present
circumstances. They are up to keeping a close eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and any
fool knows that a poor creetur like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), beaten and kicked and
scarred and bruised from head to foot, will stand by the husband that
ill uses her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) through thick and thin. There's something kept back.
It's a pity but what we had seen the other woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>I regretted it exceedingly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very grateful, and I felt
sure would have resisted no entreaty of mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's possible, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, pondering on it,
<div class="bookquote">``that her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) ladyship sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) up to London with some word for you, and
it's possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) husband got the watch to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) go. It don't
come out altogether so plain as to please me, but it's on the cards.
Now, I don't take kindly to laying out the money of Sir Leicester
Dedlock, Baronet, on these roughs, and I don't see my way to the
usefulness of it at present. No! So far our road, Miss Summerson, is
for`ard--straight ahead--and keeping everything quiet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>We called at home once more that I might send a hasty note to my
guardian, and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage.
The horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming, and we
were on the road again in a few minutes.

<p/>It had set in snowing at daybreak, and it now snowed hard. The air
was so thick with the darkness of the day and the density of the fall
that we could see but a very little way in any direction. Although it
was extremely cold, the snow was but partially frozen, and it
churned--with a sound as if it were a beach of small shells--under
the hoofs of the horses into mire and water. They sometimes slipped
and floundered for a mile together, and we were obliged to come to a
standstill to rest them. One horse fell three times in this first
stage, and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to
dismount from his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) saddle and lead him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) at last.

<p/>I could eat nothing and could not sleep, and I grew so nervous under
those delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an
unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk. Yielding to my
companion's better sense, however, I remained where I was. All this
time, kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was
engaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was up and down at every house we came to, addressing
people whom he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had never beheld before as old acquaintances, running
in to warm himself at every fire he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) saw, talking and drinking and
shaking hands at every bar and tap, friendly with every waggoner,
wheelwright, blacksmith, and toll-taker, yet never seeming to lose
time, and always mounting to the box again with his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) watchful, steady
face and his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) business-like <div class="bookquote">``Get on, my lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)</div><p/>When we were changing horses the next time, he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) came from the
stable-yard, with the wet snow encrusted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) and dropping off
him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)--plashing and crashing through it to his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) wet knees as he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) had been
doing frequently since we left Saint Albans--and spoke to me at the
carriage side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep up your spirits. It's certainly true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) came on here,
Miss Summerson. There's not a doubt of the dress by this time, and
the dress has been seen here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still on foot?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still on foot. I think the gentleman you mentioned must be the point
she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)'s aiming at, and yet I don't like his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) living down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) own part
of the country neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know so little,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``There may be some one else nearer here,
of whom I never heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. But whatever you do, don't you fall a-crying, my dear;
and don't you worry yourself no more than you can help. Get on, my
lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sleet fell all that day unceasingly, a thick mist came on early,
and it never rose or lightened for a moment. Such roads I had never
seen. I sometimes feared we had missed the way and got into the
ploughed grounds or the marshes. If I ever thought of the time I had
been out, it presented itself as an indefinite period of great
duration, and I seemed, in a strange way, never to have been free
from the anxiety under which I then laboured.

<p/>As we advanced, I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost
confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was the same as before with all the roadside people,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked graver when he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sat by himself on the box. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
finger uneasily going across and across his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mouth during the whole of
one long weary stage. I overheard that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) began to ask the drivers of
coaches and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had
seen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance. Their
replies did not encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) always gave me a reassuring beck of
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) finger and lift of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eyelid as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) got upon the box again, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) seemed perplexed now when he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Get on, my lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At last, when we were changing, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had lost the track
of the dress so long that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) began to be surprised. It was nothing,
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, to lose such a track for one while, and to take it up for
another while, and so on; but it had disappeared here in an
unaccountable manner, and we had not come upon it since. This
corroborated the apprehensions I had formed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) began to look at
direction-posts, and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a
quarter of an hour at a time while he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) explored them. But I was not to
be down-hearted, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) told me, for it was as likely as not that the
next stage might set us right again.

<p/>The next stage, however, ended as that one ended; we had no new clue.
There was a spacious inn here, solitary, but a comfortable
substantial building, and as we drove in under a large gateway before
I knew it, where a landlady and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) pretty daughters came to the
carriage-door, entreating me to alight and refresh myself while the
horses were making ready, I thought it would be uncharitable to
refuse. They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there.

<p/>It was at the corner of the house, I remember, looking two ways. On
one side to a stable-yard open to a by-road, where the ostlers were
unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage,
and beyond that to the by-road itself, across which the sign was
heavily swinging; on the other side to a wood of dark pine-trees.
Their branches were encumbered with snow, and it silently dropped off
in wet heaps while I stood at the window. Night was setting in, and
its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire
glowing and gleaming in the window-pane. As I looked among the stems
of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the
thaw was sinking into it and undermining it, I thought of the
motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now
welcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die.

<p/>I was frightened when I found them all about me, but I remembered
that before I fainted I tried very hard not to do it; and that was
some little comfort. They cushioned me up on a large sofa by the
fire, and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no
further to-night, but must go to bed. But this put me into such a
tremble lest they should detain me there that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soon recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
words and compromised for a rest of half an hour.

<p/>A good endearing creature she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) three fair girls, all
so busy about me. I was to take hot soup and broiled fowl, while Mr.
Bucket dried himself and dined elsewhere; but I could not do it when
a snug round table was presently spread by the fireside, though I was
very unwilling to disappoint them. However, I could take some toast
and some hot negus, and as I really enjoyed that refreshment, it made
some recompense.

<p/>Punctual to the time, at the half-hour's end the carriage came
rumbling under the gateway, and they took me down, warmed, refreshed,
comforted by kindness, and safe -LRB-I assured them-RRB- not to faint any
more. After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all,
the youngest daughter--a blooming girl of nineteen, who was to be the
first married, they had told me--got upon the carriage step, reached
in, and kissed me. I have never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), from that hour, but I think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to this hour as my friend.

<p/>The transparent windows with the fire and light, looking so bright
and warm from the cold darkness out of doors, were soon gone, and
again we were crushing and churning the loose snow. We went on with
toil enough, but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had
been, and the stage was only nine miles. My companion smoking on the
box--I had thought at the last inn of begging him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to do so when I saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco--was
as vigilant as ever and as quickly down and up again when we came to
any human abode or any human creature. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) little dark
lantern, which seemed to be a favourite with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), for we had lamps to
the carriage; and every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) turned it upon me to see that
I was doing well. There was a folding-window to the carriage-head,
but I never closed it, for it seemed like shutting out hope.

<p/>We came to the end of the stage, and still the lost trace was not
recovered. I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) anxiously when we stopped to change, but I
knew by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) yet graver face as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stood watching the ostlers that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
had heard nothing. Almost in an instant afterwards, as I leaned back
in my seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked in, with his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lighted lantern in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hand, an
excited and quite different man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, starting. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. Don't deceive yourself, my dear. Nobody's here. But I've got
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The crystallized snow was in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eyelashes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hair, lying in
ridges on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had to shake it from his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) face and get his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
breath before he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) spoke to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), beating his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) finger on the apron,
<div class="bookquote">``don't you be disappointed at what I'm a-going to do. You know me.
I'm Inspector Bucket, and you can trust me. We've come a long way;
never mind. Four horses out there for the next stage up! Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a commotion in the yard, and a man came running out of the
stables to know if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant up or down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up, I tell you! Up! Ain't it English? Up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Up?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, astonished. <div class="bookquote">``To London! Are we going back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``back. Straight back as a die. You
know me. Don't be afraid. I'll follow the other, by G--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The other?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You called her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) Jenny, didn't you? I'll follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>). Bring those two
pair out here for a crown a man. Wake up, some of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not desert this lady we are in search of; you will not
abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on such a night and in such a state of mind as I know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
to be in!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, in an agony, and grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, my dear, I won't. But I'll follow the other. Look
alive here with them horses. Send a man for`ard in the saddle to the
next stage, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) send another for`ard again, and order four
on, up, right through. My darling, don't you be afraid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>These orders and the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran about the yard urging them
caused a general excitement that was scarcely less bewildering to me
than the sudden change. But in the height of the confusion, a mounted
man galloped away to order the relays, and our horses were put to
with great speed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, jumping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) seat and looking in again,
<div class="bookquote">''--you'll excuse me if I'm too familiar--don't you fret and worry
yourself no more than you can help. I say nothing else at present;
but you know me, my dear; now, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>I endeavoured to say that I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) was far more capable than I of
deciding what we ought to do, but was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) sure that this was right?
Could I not go forward by myself in search of--I grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hand
again in my distress and whispered it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)--of my own mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I know, I know, and would I put you wrong,
do you think? Inspector Bucket. Now you know me, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What could I say but yes!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you keep up as good a heart as you can, and you rely upon me
for standing by you, no less than by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.
Now, are you right there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Off she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) goes, then. And get on, my lads!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come, tearing
up the miry sleet and thawing snow as if they were torn up by a
waterwheel.




<p/>CHAPTER LVIII

<p/>A Wintry Day and Night


<p/>Still impassive, as behoves its breeding, the Dedlock town house
carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur. There
are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the
hall, looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky;
and in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning itself
exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of
doors. It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire,
but is expected to return presently.

<p/>Rumour, busy overmuch, however, will not go down into Lincolnshire.
It persists in flitting and chattering about town. It knows that that
poor unfortunate man, Sir Leicester, has been sadly used. It hears,
my dear child, all sorts of shocking things. It makes the world of
five miles round quite merry. Not to know that there is something
wrong at the Dedlocks' is to augur yourself unknown. One of the
peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats is already apprised
of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the
Lords on Sir Leicester's application for a bill of divorce.

<p/>At Blaze and Sparkle's the jewellers and at Sheen and Gloss's the
mercers, it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age,
the feature of the century. The patronesses of those establishments,
albeit so loftily inscrutable, being as nicely weighed and measured
there as any other article of the stock-in-trade, are perfectly
understood in this new fashion by the rawest hand behind the counter.
<div class="bookquote">``Our people, Mr. Jones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Blaze Sparkle</b></font>)</div>said Blaze and Sparkle to the hand in
question on engaging him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``our people, sir, are sheep--mere sheep.
Where two or three marked ones go, all the rest follow. Keep those
two or three in your eye, Mr. Jones, and you have the flock.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>So,
likewise, Sheen and Gloss to THEIR Jones, in reference to knowing
where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they
-LRB-Sheen and Gloss-RRB- choose into fashion. On similar unerring
principles, Mr. Sladdery the librarian, and indeed the great farmer
of gorgeous sheep, admits this very day, <div class="bookquote">``Why yes, sir, there
certainly ARE reports concerning Lady Dedlock, very current indeed
among my high connexion, sir. You see, my high connexion must talk
about something, sir; and it's only to get a subject into vogue with
one or two ladies I could name to make it go down with the whole.
Just what I should have done with those ladies, sir, in the case of
any novelty you had left to me to bring in, they have done of
themselves in this case through knowing Lady Dedlock and being
perhaps a little innocently jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) too, sir. You'll find,
sir, that this topic will be very popular among my high connexion. If
it had been a speculation, sir, it would have brought money. And when
I say so, you may trust to my being right, sir, for I have made it my
business to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like
a clock, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus rumour thrives in the capital, and will not go down into
Lincolnshire. By half-past five, post meridian, Horse Guards' time,
it has even elicited a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables,
which bids fair to outshine the old one, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has so long
rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) colloquial reputation. This sparkling sally is to the
effect that although he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) always knew she (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) was the best-groomed woman in
the stud, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had no idea she (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) was a bolter. It is immensely received
in turf-circles.

<p/>At feasts and festivals also, in firmaments she (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) has often graced, and
among constellations she (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) outshone but yesterday, she (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) is still the
prevalent subject. What is it? Who is it? When was it? Where was it?
How was it? She (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) is discussed by her (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) dear friends with all the
genteelest slang in vogue, with the last new word, the last new
manner, the last new drawl, and the perfection of polite
indifference. A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found
to be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never
came out before--positively say things! William Buffy carries one of
these smartnesses from the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) dines down to the House,
where the Whip for his (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) party hands it about with his (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) snuff-box to
keep men together who want to be off, with such effect that the
Speaker -LRB-who has had it privately insinuated into his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) own ear under
the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) wig-RRB- cries, <div class="bookquote">``Order at the bar!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Speaker</b></font>)</div>three times without
making an impression.

<p/>And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) being
vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of Mr.
Sladdery's high connexion, people who know nothing and ever did know
nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>), think it essential to their reputation to pretend
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) is their topic too, and to retail her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) at second-hand with
the last new word and the last new manner, and the last new drawl,
and the last new polite indifference, and all the rest of it, all at
second-hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to
fainter stars. If there be any man of letters, art, or science among
these little dealers, how noble in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to support the feeble sisters
on such majestic crutches!

<p/>So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion. How within it?

<p/>Sir Leicester, lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed, can speak a little, though with
difficulty and indistinctness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is enjoined to silence and to rest,
and they have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some opiate to lull his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pain, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old
enemy is very hard with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is never asleep, though sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
seems to fall into a dull waking doze. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caused his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bedstead to be
moved out nearer to the window when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard it was such inclement
weather, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head to be so adjusted that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see the driving
snow and sleet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watches it as it falls, throughout the whole
wintry day.

<p/>Upon the least noise in the house, which is kept hushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand is
at the pencil. The old housekeeper, sitting by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would write and whispers, <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has not come back yet, Sir
Leicester. It was late last night when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has been but a
little time gone yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) withdraws his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow
again until they seem, by being long looked at, to fall so thick and
fast that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is obliged to close his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes for a minute on the giddy
whirl of white flakes and icy blots.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to look at them as soon as it was light. The day is not yet
far spent when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conceives it to be necessary that her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) rooms should
be prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). It is very cold and wet. Let there be good
fires. Let them know that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is expected. Please see to it yourself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writes to this purpose on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slate, and Mrs. Rouncewell with a
heavy heart obeys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For I dread, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the old lady says to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son, who waits below
to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) company when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has a little leisure, <div class="bookquote">``I dread, my dear,
that my Lady will never more set foot within these walls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a bad presentiment, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor yet within the walls of Chesney Wold, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's worse. But why, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I saw my Lady yesterday, George, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) looked to me--and I may
say at me too--as if the step on the Ghost's Walk had almost walked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come! You alarm yourself with old-story fears, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No I don't, my dear. No I don't. It's going on for sixty year that I
have been in this family, and I never had any fears for it before.
But it's breaking up, my dear; the great old Dedlock family is
breaking up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in
this illness and trouble, for I know I am not too old nor too useless
to be a welcomer sight to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) than anybody else in my place would be.
But the step on the Ghost's Walk will walk my Lady down, George; it
has been many a day behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and now it will pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mother dear, I say again, I hope not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, so do I, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>the old lady returns, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head and
parting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) folded hands. <div class="bookquote">``But if my fears come true, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has to
know it, who will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are these her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rooms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are my Lady's rooms, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, glancing round him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) and speaking in a
lower voice, <div class="bookquote">``I begin to understand how you come to think as you do
think, mother. Rooms get an awful look about them when they are
fitted up, like these, for one person you are used to see in them,
and that person is away under any shadow, let alone being God knows
where.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is not far out. As all partings foreshadow the great final one,
so, empty rooms, bereft of a familiar presence, mournfully whisper
what your room and what mine must one day be. My Lady's state has a
hollow look, thus gloomy and abandoned; and in the inner apartment,
where Mr. Bucket last night made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) secret perquisition, the traces
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dresses and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ornaments, even the mirrors accustomed to
reflect them when they were a portion of herself, have a desolate and
vacant air. Dark and cold as the wintry day is, it is darker and
colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely
exclude the weather; and though the servants heap fires in the grates
and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that
let their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners, there is
a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel.

<p/>The old housekeeper and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) son remain until the preparations are
complete, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) returns upstairs. Volumnia has taken Mrs.
Rouncewell's place in the meantime, though pearl necklaces and rouge
pots, however calculated to embellish Bath, are but indifferent
comforts to the invalid under present circumstances. Volumnia, not
being supposed to know -LRB-and indeed not knowing-RRB- what is the matter,
has found it a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations and
consequently has supplied their place with distracting smoothings of
the bed-linen, elaborate locomotion on tiptoe, vigilant peeping at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) kinsman's eyes, and one exasperating whisper to herself of, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
is asleep.''  (<font color='red'><b>kinsman</b></font>)</div>In disproof of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has
indignantly written on the slate, <div class="bookquote">``I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>Yielding, therefore, the chair at the bedside to the quaint old
housekeeper, Volumnia sits at a table a little removed,
sympathetically sighing. Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and
listens for the returning steps that he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) expects. In the ears of his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
old servant, looking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had stepped out of an old
picture-frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world, the
silence is fraught with echoes of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own words, <div class="bookquote">``Who will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) has been under his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) valet's hands this morning to be made
presentable and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
is propped with pillows, his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) grey hair is brushed in its usual
manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) linen is arranged to a nicety, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) is wrapped in a
responsible dressing-gown. His (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) eye-glass and his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) watch are ready to
his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) hand. It is necessary--less to his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) own dignity now perhaps than
for her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) sake--that he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) should be seen as little disturbed and as much
himself as may be. Women will talk, and Volumnia, though a Dedlock,
is no exceptional case. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) here, there is little doubt, to
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) talking somewhere else. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) is very ill, but he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) makes his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
present stand against distress of mind and body most courageously.

<p/>The fair Volumnia, being one of those sprightly girls who cannot long
continue silent without imminent peril of seizure by the dragon
Boredom, soon indicates the approach of that monster with a series of
undisguisable yawns. Finding it impossible to suppress those yawns by
any other process than conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) compliments Mrs. Rouncewell
on her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) son, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) positively is one of the finest figures
she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) ever saw and as soldierly a looking person, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) should think, as
what's his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name, her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) favourite Life Guardsman--the man she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) dotes on,
the dearest of creatures--who was killed at Waterloo.

<p/>Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares
about him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it
necessary to explain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Dedlock don't speak of my eldest son, Sir Leicester, but my
youngest. I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has come home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry. <div class="bookquote">``George? Your son
George come home, Mrs. Rouncewell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The old housekeeper wipes her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God. Yes, Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Does this discovery of some one lost, this return of some one so long
gone, come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as a strong confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hopes? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
think, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I not, with the aid I have, recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) safely after
this, there being fewer hours in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) case than there are years in
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It is of no use entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is determined to speak now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
does. In a thick crowd of sounds, but still intelligibly enough to be
understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you not tell me, Mrs. Rouncewell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It happened only yesterday, Sir Leicester, and I doubted your being
well enough to be talked to of such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>scream</b></font>)</div><p/>Besides, the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) little scream that
nobody was to have known of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) being Mrs. Rouncewell's son and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) was not to have told. But Mrs. Rouncewell protests, with warmth
enough to swell the stomacher, that of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) would have told Sir
Leicester as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) got better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is your son George, Mrs. Rouncewell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div>asks Sir Leicester,

<p/>Mrs. Rouncewell, not a little alarmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) disregard of the
doctor's injunctions, replies, in London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rouncewell/Rouncewell</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) here to my room. Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Sir Leicester,
with such power of movement as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has, arranges himself a little to
receive him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) looks out again at the falling
sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps. A quantity
of straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises
there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) might be driven to the door perhaps without his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
hearing wheels.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is lying thus, apparently forgetful of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) newer and minor
surprise, when the housekeeper returns, accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) trooper
son. Mr. George approaches softly to the bedside, makes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bow,
squares his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chest, and stands, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face flushed, very heartily
ashamed of himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heaven, and it is really George Rouncewell!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaims Sir
Leicester. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember me, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper needs to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) and to separate this sound from that
sound before he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) has said, but doing this and being a
little helped by his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) replies, <div class="bookquote">``I must have a very bad
memory, indeed, Sir Leicester, if I failed to remember you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I look at you, George Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Sir Leicester observes with
difficulty, <div class="bookquote">``I see something of a boy at Chesney Wold--I remember
well--very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) looks at the trooper until tears come into his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) eyes, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
looks at the sleet and snow again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon, Sir Leicester,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, <div class="bookquote">``but would you
accept of my arms to raise you up? You would lie easier, Sir
Leicester, if you would allow me to move you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, George Rouncewell; if you will be so good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper takes him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) arms like a child, lightly raises him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>),
and turns him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) face more towards the window. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. You
have your mother's gentleness,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returns Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``and your own
strength. Thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) signs to him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) hand not to go away. George quietly remains
at the bedside, waiting to be spoken to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you wish for secrecy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It takes Sir Leicester some time to
ask this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly I am not much to boast of, Sir Leicester, and I--I should
still, Sir Leicester, if you was not so indisposed--which I hope you
will not be long--I should still hope for the favour of being allowed
to remain unknown in general. That involves explanations not very
hard to be guessed at, not very well timed here, and not very
creditable to myself. However opinions may differ on a variety of
subjects, I should think it would be universally agreed, Sir
Leicester, that I am not much to boast of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been a soldier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>observes Sir Leicester, <div class="bookquote">``and a faithful
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>George makes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) military bow. <div class="bookquote">``As far as that goes, Sir Leicester, I
have done my duty under discipline, and it was the least I could do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You find me,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>says Sir Leicester, whose eyes are much attracted
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``far from well, George Rouncewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it, Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are. No. In addition to my older malady, I have had a
sudden and bad attack. Something that deadens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>making an endeavour
to pass one hand down one side, <div class="bookquote">``and confuses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>touching his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips.

<p/>George, with a look of assent and sympathy, makes another bow. The
different times when they were both young men -LRB-the trooper much the
younger of the two-RRB- and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold
arise before them both and soften both.

<p/>Sir Leicester, evidently with a great determination to say, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>)
own manner, something that is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) mind before relapsing into
silence, tries to raise himself among his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) pillows a little more.
George, observant of the action, takes him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms again and
places him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) desires to be. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, George. You are another
self to me. You have often carried my spare gun at Chesney Wold,
George. You are familiar to me in these strange circumstances, very
familiar.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has put Sir Leicester's sounder arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shoulder
in lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up, and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again
as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says these words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was about to add,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) presently goes on, <div class="bookquote">``I was about to add,
respecting this attack, that it was unfortunately simultaneous with a
slight misunderstanding between my Lady and myself. I do not mean
that there was any difference between us -LRB-for there has been none-RRB-,
but that there was a misunderstanding of certain circumstances
important only to ourselves, which deprives me, for a little while,
of my Lady's society. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has found it necessary to make a journey--I
trust will shortly return. Volumnia, do I make myself intelligible?
The words are not quite under my command in the manner of pronouncing
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia understands him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) perfectly, and in truth he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) delivers himself
with far greater plainness than could have been supposed possible a
minute ago. The effort by which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) does so is written in the anxious
and labouring expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face. Nothing but the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
purpose enables him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to make it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore, Volumnia, I desire to say in your presence--and in the
presence of my old retainer and friend, Mrs. Rouncewell, whose truth
and fidelity no one can question, and in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) son
George, who comes back like a familiar recollection of my youth in
the home of my ancestors at Chesney Wold--in case I should relapse,
in case I should not recover, in case I should lose both my speech
and the power of writing, though I hope for better things--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The old housekeeper weeping silently; Volumnia in the greatest
agitation, with the freshest bloom on her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) cheeks; the trooper with
his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) arms folded and his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head a little bent, respectfully attentive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore I desire to say, and to call you all to
witness--beginning, Volumnia, with yourself, most solemnly--that I am
on unaltered terms with Lady Dedlock. That I assert no cause whatever
of complaint against her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>). That I have ever had the strongest
affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>), and that I retain it undiminished. Say this to
herself, and to every one. If you ever say less than this, you will
be guilty of deliberate falsehood to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Volumnia tremblingly protests that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) will observe his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) injunctions
to the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady is too high in position, too handsome, too accomplished, too
superior in most respects to the best of those by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is
surrounded, not to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) enemies and traducers, I dare say. Let it
be known to them, as I make it known to you, that being of sound
mind, memory, and understanding, I revoke no disposition I have made
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) favour. I abridge nothing I have ever bestowed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). I am
on unaltered terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and I recall--having the full power to
do it if I were so disposed, as you see--no act I have done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
advantage and happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) formal array of words might have at any other time, as it has
often had, something ludicrous in it, but at this time it is serious
and affecting. His (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) noble earnestness, his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) fidelity, his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) gallant
shielding of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) generous conquest of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) own wrong and his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) own
pride for her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) sake, are simply honourable, manly, and true. Nothing
less worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the
commonest mechanic, nothing less worthy can be seen in the best-born
gentleman. In such a light both aspire alike, both rise alike, both
children of the dust shine equally.

<p/>Overpowered by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exertions, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lays his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head back on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pillows
and closes his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes for not more than a minute, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again resumes
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watching of the weather and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attention to the muffled sounds.
In the rendering of those little services, and in the manner of their
acceptance, the trooper has become installed as necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>).
Nothing has been said, but it is quite understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) falls a step or
two backward to be out of sight and mounts guard a little behind his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)
mother's chair.

<p/>The day is now beginning to decline. The mist and the sleet into
which the snow has all resolved itself are darker, and the blaze
begins to tell more vividly upon the room walls and furniture. The
gloom augments; the bright gas springs up in the streets; and the
pertinacious oil lamps which yet hold their ground there, with their
source of life half frozen and half thawed, twinkle gaspingly like
fiery fish out of water--as they are. The world, which has been
rumbling over the straw and pulling at the bell, <div class="bookquote">``to inquire,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>begins
to go home, begins to dress, to dine, to discuss its dear friend with
all the last new modes, as already mentioned.

<p/>Now does Sir Leicester become worse, restless, uneasy, and in great
pain. Volumnia, lighting a candle -LRB-with a predestined aptitude for
doing something objectionable-RRB-, is bidden to put it out again, for it
is not yet dark enough. Yet it is very dark too, as dark as it will
be all night. By and by she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tries again. No! Put it out. It is not
dark enough yet.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) old housekeeper is the first to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is striving to
uphold the fiction with himself that it is not growing late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Sir Leicester, my honoured master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) softly whispers, <div class="bookquote">``I
must, for your own good, and my duty, take the freedom of begging and
praying that you will not lie here in the lone darkness watching and
waiting and dragging through the time. Let me draw the curtains, and
light the candles, and make things more comfortable about you. The
church-clocks will strike the hours just the same, Sir Leicester, and
the night will pass away just the same. My Lady will come back, just
the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it, Mrs. Rouncewell, but I am weak--and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has been so long
gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so very long, Sir Leicester. Not twenty-four hours yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is a long time. Oh, it is a long time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) says it with a groan that wrings her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) thinks his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tears too sacred to be seen, even by her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>).
Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) sits in the darkness for a while without a word, then
gently begins to move about, now stirring the fire, now standing at
the dark window looking out. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), with recovered
self-command, <div class="bookquote">``As you say, Mrs. Rouncewell, it is no worse for being
confessed. It is getting late, and they are not come. Light the
room!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>When it is lighted and the weather shut out, it is only left
to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to listen.

<p/>But they find that however dejected and ill he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brightens when
a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) rooms and
being sure that everything is ready to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). Poor pretence as
it is, these allusions to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) being expected keep up hope within him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>Midnight comes, and with it the same blank. The carriages in the
streets are few, and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there
are none, unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the
frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement. Upon this
wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is
like looking at intense darkness. If any distant sound be audible in
this case, it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that,
and all is heavier than before.

<p/>The corporation of servants are dismissed to bed -LRB-not unwilling to
go, for they were up all last night-RRB-, and only Mrs. Rouncewell and
George keep watch in Sir Leicester's room. As the night lags tardily
on--or rather when it seems to stop altogether, at between two and
three o'clock--they find a restless craving on him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to know more about
the weather, now he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cannot see it. Hence George, patrolling regularly
every half-hour to the rooms so carefully looked after, extends his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
march to the hall-door, looks about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and brings back the best
report he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can make of the worst of nights, the sleet still falling
and even the stone footways lying ankle-deep in icy sludge.

<p/>Volumnia, in her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) room up a retired landing on the staircase--the
second turning past the end of the carving and gilding, a cousinly
room containing a fearful abortion of a portrait of Sir Leicester
banished for its crimes, and commanding in the day a solemn yard
planted with dried-up shrubs like antediluvian specimens of black
tea--is a prey to horrors of many kinds. Not last nor least among
them, possibly, is a horror of what may befall her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) little income in
the event, as she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) expresses it, <div class="bookquote">``of anything happening''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to Sir
Leicester. Anything, in this sense, meaning one thing only; and that
the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in
the known world.

<p/>An effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cannot go to
bed in her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own room or sit by the fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own room, but must come
forth with her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fair head tied up in a profusion of shawl, and her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
fair form enrobed in drapery, and parade the mansion like a ghost,
particularly haunting the rooms, warm and luxurious, prepared for one
who still does not return. Solitude under such circumstances being
not to be thought of, Volumnia is attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) maid, who,
impressed from her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own bed for that purpose, extremely cold, very
sleepy, and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances
to take office with a cousin, when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had resolved to be maid to
nothing less than ten thousand a year, has not a sweet expression of
countenance.

<p/>The periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms, however, in the
course of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) patrolling is an assurance of protection and company
both to mistress and maid, which renders them very acceptable in the
small hours of the night. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) is heard advancing, they both
make some little decorative preparation to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>); at other
times they divide their watches into short scraps of oblivion and
dialogues not wholly free from acerbity, as to whether Miss Dedlock,
sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) feet upon the fender, was or was not falling into
the fire when rescued -LRB-to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) great displeasure-RRB- by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) guardian
genius the maid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Sir Leicester now, Mr. George?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquires Volumnia, adjusting
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) cowl over her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Sir Leicester is much the same, miss. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is very low and ill,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) even wanders a little sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquires Volumnia tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no, I can't say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has, miss. Not within my hearing, that is to
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a truly sad time, Mr. George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is indeed, miss. Hadn't you better go to bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had a deal better go to bed, Miss Dedlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>quoth the maid
sharply.

<p/>But Volumnia answers No! No! She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) may be asked for, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) may be wanted
at a moment's notice. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) never should forgive herself <div class="bookquote">``if anything
was to happen''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was not on the spot. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) declines to enter on
the question, mooted by the maid, how the spot comes to be there, and
not in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) room -LRB-which is nearer to Sir Leicester's-RRB-, but staunchly
declares that on the spot she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) will remain. Volumnia further makes a
merit of not having <div class="bookquote">``closed an eye'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--as if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had twenty or
thirty--though it is hard to reconcile this statement with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) having
most indisputably opened two within five minutes.

<p/>But when it comes to four o'clock, and still the same blank,
Volumnia's constancy begins to fail her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), or rather it begins to
strengthen, for she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) now considers that it is her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) duty to be ready for
the morrow, when much may be expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), that, in fact,
howsoever anxious to remain upon the spot, it may be required of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>),
as an act of self-devotion, to desert the spot. So when the trooper
reappears with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better go to bed, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>and when the
maid protests, more sharply than before, <div class="bookquote">``You had a deal better go to
bed, Miss Dedlock!''  (<font color='red'><b>maid</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) meekly rises and says, <div class="bookquote">``Do with me what you
think best!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm to the
door of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) cousinly chamber, and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it
best to hustle her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) into bed with mighty little ceremony. Accordingly,
these steps are taken; and now the trooper, in his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) rounds, has the
house to himself.

<p/>There is no improvement in the weather. From the portico, from the
eaves, from the parapet, from every ledge and post and pillar, drips
the thawed snow. It has crept, as if for shelter, into the lintels of
the great door--under it, into the corners of the windows, into every
chink and crevice of retreat, and there wastes and dies. It is
falling still; upon the roof, upon the skylight, even through the
skylight, and drip, drip, drip, with the regularity of the Ghost's
Walk, on the stone floor below.

<p/>The trooper, his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) old recollections awakened by the solitary grandeur
of a great house--no novelty to him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) once at Chesney Wold--goes up the
stairs and through the chief rooms, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) light at arm's
length. Thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) varied fortunes within the last few weeks,
and of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) rustic boyhood, and of the two periods of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) life so
strangely brought together across the wide intermediate space;
thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind;
thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and
the tokens of whose recent presence are all here; thinking of the
master of the house upstairs and of the foreboding, <div class="bookquote">``Who will tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) looks here and looks there, and reflects how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) MIGHT see
something now, which it would tax his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) boldness to walk up to, lay his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
hand upon, and prove to be a fancy. But it is all blank, blank as the
darkness above and below, while he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) goes up the great staircase again,
blank as the oppressive silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All is still in readiness, George Rouncewell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite orderly and right, Sir Leicester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No word of any kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trooper</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No letter that can possibly have been overlooked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) knows there is no such hope as that and lays his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head down
without looking for an answer.

<p/>Very familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) said himself some hours ago, George
Rouncewell lifts him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) into easier positions through the long remainder
of the blank wintry night, and equally familiar with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) unexpressed
wish, extinguishes the light and undraws the curtains at the first
late break of day. The day comes like a phantom. Cold, colourless,
and vague, it sends a warning streak before it of a deathlike hue, as
if it cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Look what I am bringing you who watch there! Who
will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Esther/Miss Summerson/Esther Summerson</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LIX

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>It was three o'clock in the morning when the houses outside London
did at last begin to exclude the country and to close us in with
streets. We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition
than when we had traversed them by daylight, both the fall and the
thaw having lasted ever since; but the energy of my companion never
slackened. It had only been, as I thought, of less assistance than
the horses in getting us on, and it had often aided them. They had
stopped exhausted half-way up hills, they had been driven through
streams of turbulent water, they had slipped down and become
entangled with the harness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) little lantern had been
always ready, and when the mishap was set right, I had never heard
any variation in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cool, <div class="bookquote">``Get on, my lads!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The steadiness and confidence with which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had directed our journey
back I could not account for. Never wavering, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) never even stopped
to make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London. A very
few words, here and there, were then enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); and thus we
came, at between three and four o'clock in the morning, into
Islington.

<p/>I will not dwell on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected
all this time that we were leaving my mother farther and farther
behind every minute. I think I had some strong hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) must be
right and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following
this woman, but I tormented myself with questioning it and discussing
it during the whole journey. What was to ensue when we found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and
what could compensate us for this loss of time were questions also
that I could not possibly dismiss; my mind was quite tortured by long
dwelling on such reflections when we stopped.

<p/>We stopped in a high-street where there was a coach-stand. My
companion paid our two drivers, who were as completely covered with
splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the
carriage itself, and giving them some brief direction where to take
it, lifted me out of it and into a hackney-coach he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had chosen from
the rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) did this. <div class="bookquote">``How wet you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had not been conscious of it. But the melted snow had found its way
into the carriage, and I had got out two or three times when a fallen
horse was plunging and had to be got up, and the wet had penetrated
my dress. I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) it was no matter, but the driver, who knew
him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), would not be dissuaded by me from running down the street to his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
stable, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) brought an armful of clean dry straw. They shook it
out and strewed it well about me, and I found it warm and
comfortable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head in at the window after
I was shut up. <div class="bookquote">``We're a-going to mark this person down. It may take a
little time, but you don't mind that. You're pretty sure that I've
got a motive. Ain't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I little thought what it was, little thought in how short a time I
should understand it better, but I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) that I had confidence
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you may have, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``And I tell you what! If you
only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after
what I've experienced of you, that'll do. Lord! You're no trouble at
all. I never see a young woman in any station of society--and I've
seen many elevated ones too--conduct herself like you have conducted
yourself since you was called out of your bed. You're a pattern, you
know, that's what you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket warmly; <div class="bookquote">``you're a
pattern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) I was very glad, as indeed I was, to have been no
hindrance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), and that I hoped I should be none now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``when a young lady is as mild as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s game,
and as game as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s mild, that's all I ask, and more than I expect.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) then becomes a queen, and that's about what you are yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With these encouraging words--they really were encouraging to me
under those lonely and anxious circumstances--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) got upon the box,
and we once more drove away. Where we drove I neither knew then nor
have ever known since, but we appeared to seek out the narrowest and
worst streets in London. Whenever I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) directing the driver, I
was prepared for our descending into a deeper complication of such
streets, and we never failed to do so.

<p/>Sometimes we emerged upon a wider thoroughfare or came to a larger
building than the generality, well lighted. Then we stopped at
offices like those we had visited when we began our journey, and I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in consultation with others. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would get down by
an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) little lantern. This would attract similar lights from various
dark quarters, like so many insects, and a fresh consultation would
be held. By degrees we appeared to contract our search within
narrower and easier limits. Single police-officers on duty could now
tell Mr. Bucket what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) wanted to know and point to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) where to go.
At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) and one
of these men, which I supposed to be satisfactory from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) manner of
nodding from time to time. When it was finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) came to me looking
very busy and very attentive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) said to me, <div class="bookquote">``you won't be alarmed whatever
comes off, I know. It's not necessary for me to give you any further
caution than to tell you that we have marked this person down and
that you may be of use to me before I know it myself. I don't like to
ask such a thing, my dear, but would you walk a little way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I got out directly and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't so easy to keep your feet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``but take
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the
street, I thought I knew the place. <div class="bookquote">``Are we in Holborn?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know this turning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like Chancery Lane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was christened so, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket.

<p/>We turned down it, and as we went shuffling through the sleet, I
heard the clocks strike half-past five. We passed on in silence and
as quickly as we could with such a foot-hold, when some one coming
towards us on the narrow pavement, wrapped in a cloak, stopped and
stood aside to give me room. In the same moment I heard an
exclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt. I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
voice very well.

<p/>It was so unexpected and so--I don't know what to call it, whether
pleasant or painful--to come upon it after my feverish wandering
journey, and in the midst of the night, that I could not keep back
the tears from my eyes. It was like hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) voice in a strange
country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson, that you should be out at this hour, and in
such weather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some
uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) that we had but just left a coach and were going--but then I
was obliged to look at my companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, Mr. Woodcourt'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had caught the name from me--<div class="bookquote">``we
are a-going at present into the next street. Inspector Bucket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodcourt, disregarding my remonstrances, had hurriedly taken off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) cloak and was putting it about me. <div class="bookquote">``That's a good move, too,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, assisting, <div class="bookquote">``a very good move.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt. I don't know whether to me
or to my companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bucket, taking the answer on himself. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It was all said in a moment, and they took me between them, wrapped
in the cloak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just left Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt. <div class="bookquote">``I have been sitting
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) since ten o'clock last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is ill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, believe me; not ill, but not quite well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was depressed
and faint--you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gets so worried and so worn sometimes--and Ada
sent to me of course; and when I came home I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) note and came
straight here. Well! Richard revived so much after a little while,
and Ada was so happy and so convinced of its being my doing, though
God knows I had little enough to do with it, that I remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been fast asleep some hours. As fast asleep as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is
now, I hope!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) friendly and familiar way of speaking of them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) unaffected
devotion to them, the grateful confidence with which I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had
inspired my darling, and the comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); could I separate
all this from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) promise to me? How thankless I must have been if it
had not recalled the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) said to me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was so moved by the
change in my appearance: <div class="bookquote">``I will accept him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as a trust, and it shall
be a sacred one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We now turned into another narrow street. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bucket, who had eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) closely as we came along, <div class="bookquote">``our business
takes us to a law-stationer's here, a certain Mr. Snagsby's. What,
you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) was so quick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) saw it in an instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know a little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) and have called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) at this place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Then you will be so good as to let
me leave Miss Summerson with you for a moment while I go and have
half a word with him (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The police-officer</b></font>)</div><p/>The last police-officer with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had conferred was standing
silently behind us. I was not aware of it until he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) struck in on my
saying I heard some one crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``It's Snagsby's servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``the girl's subject to fits, and has
'em bad upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to-night. A most contrary circumstance it is, for I
want certain information out of that girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be brought to
reason somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At all events, they wouldn't be up yet if it wasn't for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Mr.
Bucket,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the other man. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s been at it pretty well all night,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``My light's burnt out. Show yours a
moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I
could faintly hear crying and moaning. In the little round of light
produced for the purpose, Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked.
The door was opened after he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) had knocked twice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) went in,
leaving us standing in the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodcourt, <div class="bookquote">``if without obtruding myself on
your confidence I may remain near you, pray let me do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are truly kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``I need wish to keep no secret of
my own from you; if I keep any, it is another's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite understand. Trust me, I will remain near you only so long as
I can fully respect it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust implicitly to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I know and deeply feel how
sacredly you keep your promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short time the little round of light shone out again, and Mr.
Bucket advanced towards us in it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) earnest face. <div class="bookquote">``Please to
come in, Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and sit down by the fire. Mr.
Woodcourt, from information I have received I understand you are a
medical man. Would you look to this girl and see if anything can be
done to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) round. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has a letter somewhere that I
particularly want. It's not in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) box, and I think it must be about
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is so twisted and clenched up that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is difficult to
handle without hurting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We all three went into the house together; although it was cold and
raw, it smelt close too from being up all night. In the passage
behind the door stood a scared, sorrowful-looking little man in a
grey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke
meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Downstairs, if you please, Mr. Bucket,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The lady will
excuse the front kitchen; we use it as our workaday sitting-room. The
back is Guster's bedroom, and in it she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a-carrying on, poor thing,
to a frightful extent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>We went downstairs, followed by Mr. Snagsby, as I soon found the
little man to be. In the front kitchen, sitting by the fire, was Mrs.
Snagsby, with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Snagsby, entering behind us, <div class="bookquote">``to
wave--not to put too fine a point upon it, my dear--hostilities for
one single moment in the course of this prolonged night, here is
Inspector Bucket, Mr. Woodcourt, and a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) looked very much astonished, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) had reason for doing, and
looked particularly hard at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Snagsby/Snagsby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Snagsby, sitting down in the remotest
corner by the door, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) were taking a liberty, <div class="bookquote">``it is not
unlikely that you may inquire of me why Inspector Bucket, Mr.
Woodcourt, and a lady call upon us in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street,
at the present hour. I don't know. I have not the least idea. If I
was to be informed, I should despair of understanding, and I'd rather
not be told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) appeared so miserable, sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) hand, and I
appeared so unwelcome, that I was going to offer an apology when Mr.
Bucket took the matter on himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Snagsby,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the best thing you can do is to go
along with Mr. Woodcourt to look after your Guster--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Guster, Mr. Bucket!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Snagsby. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, sir, go on. I
shall be charged with that next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to hold the candle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting
himself, <div class="bookquote">``or hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), or make yourself useful in any way you're
asked. Which there's not a man alive more ready to do, for you're a
man of urbanity and suavity, you know, and you've got the sort of
heart that can feel for another. Mr. Woodcourt, would you be so good
as see to her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), and if you can get that letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>), to let me
have it as soon as ever you can?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>As they went out, Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire
and take off my wet shoes, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) turned up to dry upon the fender,
talking all the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be at all put out, miss, by the want of a hospitable look
from Mrs. Snagsby there, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)'s under a mistake altogether.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>)'ll find that out sooner than will be agreeable to a lady of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
generally correct manner of forming her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thoughts, because I'm a-going
to explain it to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here, standing on the hearth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) wet hat
and shawls in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hand, himself a pile of wet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) turned to Mrs.
Snagsby. ``Now, the first thing that I say to you, as a married woman
possessing what you may call charms, you know--``Believe Me, if All
Those Endearing,<div class="bookquote">'' and cetrer--you're well acquainted with the song,
because it's in vain for you to tell me that you and good society are
strangers--charms--attractions, mind you, that ought to give you
confidence in yourself--is, that you've done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed, relented a little and faltered,
what did Mr. Bucket mean.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Mr. Bucket mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) repeated, and I saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face that
all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) talked he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was listening for the discovery of the
letter, to my own great agitation, for I knew then how important it
must be; <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) means, ma'am. Go and see Othello
acted. That's the tragedy for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby consciously asked why.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Because you'll come to that if you don't
look out. Why, at the very moment while I speak, I know what your
mind's not wholly free from respecting this young lady. But shall I
tell you who this young lady is? Now, come, you're what I call an
intellectual woman--with your soul too large for your body, if you
come to that, and chafing it--and you know me, and you recollect
where you saw me last, and what was talked of in that circle. Don't
you? Yes! Very well. This young lady is that young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did
at the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Toughey--him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as you call Jo--was mixed up in the same business,
and no other; and the law-writer that you know of was mixed up in the
same business, and no other; and your husband, with no more knowledge
of it than your great grandfather, was mixed up -LRB-by Mr. Tulkinghorn,
deceased, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulkinghorn</b></font>) best customer-RRB- in the same business, and no other; and
the whole bileing of people was mixed up in the same business, and no
other. And yet a married woman, possessing your attractions, shuts
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes -LRB-and sparklers too-RRB-, and goes and runs her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) delicate-formed
head against a wall. Why, I am ashamed of you! -LRB-I expected Mr.
Woodcourt might have got it by this time.-RRB-''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Snagsby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Snagsby shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) head and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``No. See what happens.
Another person mixed up in that business and no other, a person in a
wretched state, comes here to-night and is seen a-speaking to your
maid-servant; and between her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and your maid-servant there passes
a paper that I would give a hundred pound for, down. What do
you do? You hide and you watch 'em, and you pounce upon that
maid-servant--knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s subject to and what a little thing
will bring 'em on--in that surprising manner and with that severity
that, by the Lord, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes off and keeps off, when a life may be
hanging upon that girl's words!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) so thoroughly meant what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said now that I involuntarily clasped
my hands and felt the room turning away from me. But it stopped. Mr.
Woodcourt came in, put a paper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) hand, and went away again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mrs. Snagsby, the only amends you can make,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket,
rapidly glancing at it, <div class="bookquote">``is to let me speak a word to this young lady
in private here. And if you know of any help that you can give to
that gentleman in the next kitchen there or can think of any one
thing that's likelier than another to bring the girl round, do your
swiftest and best!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>In an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Snagsby</b></font>) was gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had shut the
door. <div class="bookquote">``Now my dear, you're steady and quite sure of yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose writing is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>It was my mother's. A pencil-writing, on a crushed and torn piece of
paper, blotted with wet. Folded roughly like a letter, and directed
to me at my guardian's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and if you are firm enough to read it
to me, do! But be particular to a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been written in portions, at different times. I read what
follows:


<p/>I came to the cottage with two objects. First, to see the
dear one, if I could, once more--but only to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--not
to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) or let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) know that I was near. The other
object, to elude pursuit and to be lost. Do not blame the
mother for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) share. The assistance that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rendered me,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rendered on my strongest assurance that it was for the
dear one's good. You remember her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dead child. The men's
consent I bought, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) help was freely given.


<p/><div class="bookquote">'''I came.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That was written,'' said my companion, <div class="bookquote">``when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rested
there. It bears out what I made of it. I was right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next was written at another time:


<p/>I have wandered a long distance, and for many hours, and
I know that I must soon die. These streets! I have no
purpose but to die. When I left, I had a worse, but I am
saved from adding that guilt to the rest. Cold, wet, and
fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead, but
I shall die of others, though I suffer from these. It was
right that all that had sustained me should give way at
once and that I should die of terror and my conscience.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``There's only a few words more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Those, too, were written at another time. To all appearance, almost
in the dark:


<p/>I have done all I could do to be lost. I shall be soon
forgotten so, and shall disgrace him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) least. I have nothing
about me by which I can be recognized. This paper I part
with now. The place where I shall lie down, if I can get
so far, has been often in my mind. Farewell. Forgive.


<p/>Mr. Bucket, supporting me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arm, lowered me gently into my
chair. <div class="bookquote">``Cheer up! Don't think me hard with you, my dear, but as soon
as ever you feel equal to it, get your shoes on and be ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) required, but I was left there a long time, praying for
my unhappy mother. They were all occupied with the poor girl, and I
heard Mr. Woodcourt directing them and speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) often. At
length he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important
to address her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) thought it best that I should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for
whatever information we desired to obtain. There was no doubt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could now reply to questions if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were soothed and not alarmed.
The questions, Mr. Bucket said, were how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came by the letter, what
passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and the person who gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the letter, and where
the person went. Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these
points, I went into the next room with them. Mr. Woodcourt would have
remained outside, but at my solicitation went in with us.

<p/>The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down.
They stood around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), though at a little distance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might
have air. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not pretty and looked weak and poor, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a
plaintive and a good face, though it was still a little wild. I
kneeled on the ground beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor head upon my
shoulder, whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm round my neck and burst into
tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, laying my face against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forehead, for
indeed I was crying too, and trembling, <div class="bookquote">``it seems cruel to trouble
you now, but more depends on our knowing something about this letter
than I could tell you in an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began piteously declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't mean any harm, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
didn't mean any harm, Mrs. Snagsby!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``But pray tell me how you got it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear lady, I will, and tell you true. I'll tell true, indeed,
Mrs. Snagsby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And how was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had been out on an errand, dear lady--long after it was
dark--quite late; and when I came home, I found a common-looking
person, all wet and muddy, looking up at our house. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw me
coming in at the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called me back and said did I live here.
And I said yes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew only one or two places about
here, but had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way and couldn't find them. Oh, what shall I
do, what shall I do! They won't believe me! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't say any harm
to me, and I didn't say any harm to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), indeed, Mrs. Snagsby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>It was necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mistress to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did, I
must say, with a good deal of contrition--before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could be got
beyond this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not find those places,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No! Couldn't find them. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so faint, and lame, and miserable, Oh so wretched, that if
you had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), Mr. Snagsby, you'd have given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) half a crown, I
know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Guster, my girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>), at first not knowing what to say.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so well spoken,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, looking at me with
wide open eyes, <div class="bookquote">``that it made a person's heart bleed. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said
to me, did I know the way to the burying ground? And I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
which burying ground. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, the poor burying ground. And so I
told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) I had been a poor child myself, and it was according to
parishes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meant a poor burying ground not very far
from here, where there was an archway, and a step, and an iron gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>As I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face and soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to go on, I saw that Mr. Bucket
received this with a look which I could not separate from one of
alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair back with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hands. <div class="bookquote">``What shall I do, what shall I do! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meant the burying
ground where the man was buried that took the sleeping-stuff--that
you came home and told us of, Mr. Snagsby--that frightened me so,
Mrs. Snagsby. Oh, I am frightened again. Hold me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so much better now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>sald I. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray tell me more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I will, yes I will! But don't be angry with me, that's a dear
lady, because I have been so ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), poor soul!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! Now I will, now I will. So she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, could I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) how to
find it, and I said yes, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at me with
eyes like almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was blind, and herself all waving back.
And so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took out the letter, and showed it me, and said if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
to put that in the post-office, it would be rubbed out and not minded
and never sent; and would I take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and send it, and the
messenger would be paid at the house. And so I said yes, if it was no
harm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said no--no harm. And so I took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had nothing to give me, and I said I was poor myself and
consequently wanted nothing. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said God bless you, and
went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) go--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, anticipating the inquiry. <div class="bookquote">``Yes! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went the
way I had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Then I came in, and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me
from somewhere and laid hold of me, and I was frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodcourt took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kindly from me. Mr. Bucket wrapped me up, and
immediately we were in the street. Mr. Woodcourt hesitated, but I
said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't leave me now!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Bucket added, <div class="bookquote">``You'll be better
with us, we may want you; don't lose time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>I have the most confused impressions of that walk. I recollect that
it was neither night nor day, that morning was dawning but the
street-lamps were not yet put out, that the sleet was still falling
and that all the ways were deep with it. I recollect a few chilled
people passing in the streets. I recollect the wet house-tops, the
clogged and bursting gutters and water-spouts, the mounds of
blackened ice and snow over which we passed, the narrowness of the
courts by which we went. At the same time I remember that the poor
girl seemed to be yet telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) story audibly and plainly in my
hearing, that I could feel her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) resting on my arm, that the stained
house-fronts put on human shapes and looked at me, that great
water-gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the
air, and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real.

<p/>At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way, where one
lamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly
struggled in. The gate was closed. Beyond it was a burial ground--a
dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring, but where
I could dimly see heaps of dishonoured graves and stones, hemmed in
by filthy houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose
walls a thick humidity broke out like a disease. On the step at the
gate, drenched in the fearful wet of such a place, which oozed and
splashed down everywhere, I saw, with a cry of pity and horror, a
woman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child.

<p/>I ran forward, but they stopped me, and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me
with the greatest earnestness, even with tears, before I went up to
the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said. I did
so, as I thought. I did so, as I am sure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson, you'll understand me, if you think a moment. They
changed clothes at the cottage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They changed clothes at the cottage. I could repeat the words in my
mind, and I knew what they meant of themselves, but I attached no
meaning to them in any other connexion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And one returned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``and one went on. And the one
that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and
then turned across country and went home. Think a moment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>I could repeat this in my mind too, but I had not the least idea what
it meant. I saw before me, lying on the step, the mother of the dead
child. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron
gate and seeming to embrace it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay there, who had so lately
spoken to my mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay there, a distressed, unsheltered,
senseless creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who had brought my mother's letter, who could
give me the only clue to where my mother was; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), who was to guide
us to rescue and save her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whom we had sought so far, who had come to
this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could
not follow, and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that
moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay there, and they stopped me! I saw but did not
comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt's face.
I saw but did not comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) touching the other on the breast to
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) back. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) stand uncovered in the bitter air, with a
reverence for something. But my understanding for all this was gone.

<p/>I even heard it said between them, <div class="bookquote">``Shall she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) had better go. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) hands should be the first to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>). They
have a higher right than ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I passed on to the gate and stooped down. I lifted the heavy head,
put the long dank hair aside, and turned the face. And it was my
mother, cold and dead.




<p/>CHAPTER LX

<p/>Perspective


<p/>I proceed to other passages of my narrative. From the goodness of all
about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved.
I have already said so much of myself, and so much still remains,
that I will not dwell upon my sorrow. I had an illness, but it was
not a long one; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could
quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy.

<p/>I proceed to other passages of my narrative.

<p/>During the time of my illness, we were still in London, where Mrs.
Woodcourt had come, on my guardian's invitation, to stay with us.
When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
in our old way--though I could have done that sooner if he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) would have
believed me--I resumed my work and my chair beside his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) had
appointed the time himself, and we were alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dame Trot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>), receiving me with a kiss, <div class="bookquote">``welcome to the
growlery again, my dear. I have a scheme to develop, little woman. I
propose to remain here, perhaps for six months, perhaps for a longer
time--as it may be. Quite to settle here for a while, in short.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, my dear? Bleak House,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``must learn to take care of
itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) tone sounded sorrowful, but looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>), I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bleak House,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) repeated--and his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) tone did NOT sound sorrowful, I
found--<div class="bookquote">``must learn to take care of itself. It is a long way from Ada,
my dear, and Ada stands much in need of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like you, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to have been taking that into
consideration for a happy surprise to both of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so disinterested either, my dear, if you mean to extol me for
that virtue, since if you were generally on the road, you could be
seldom with me. And besides, I wish to hear as much and as often of
Ada as I can in this condition of estrangement from poor Rick. Not of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) alone, but of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) too, poor fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Mr. Woodcourt, this morning, guardian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see Mr. Woodcourt every morning, Dame Durden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Durden</b></font>) still say the same of Richard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) knows of no direct bodily illness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has; on
the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has none. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is not easy about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>); who CAN be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div><p/>My dear girl had been to see us lately every day, some times twice in
a day. But we had foreseen, all along, that this would only last
until I was quite myself. We knew full well that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fervent heart
was as full of affection and gratitude towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin John as it
had ever been, and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to stay away; but we knew on the other hand that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt it
a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to be sparing of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) visits at our house.
My guardian's delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to
convey to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, unfortunate, mistaken Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``When will he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) awake
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) delusion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is not in the way to do so now, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>replied my guardian.
<div class="bookquote">``The more he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) suffers, the more averse he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) will be to me, having made
me the principal representative of the great occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
suffering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help adding, <div class="bookquote">``So unreasonably!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Dame Trot, Dame Trot,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``what shall we find
reasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce! Unreason and injustice at the
top, unreason and injustice at the heart and at the bottom, unreason
and injustice from beginning to end--if it ever has an end--how
should poor Rick, always hovering near it, pluck reason out of it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)
no more gathers grapes from thorns or figs from thistles than older
men did in old times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the Lord Chancellor, and the Vice Chancellors, and the
whole Chancery battery of great guns would be infinitely astonished
by such unreason and injustice in one of their suitors,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>pursued my
guardian. <div class="bookquote">``When those learned gentlemen begin to raise moss-roses
from the powder they sow in their wigs, I shall begin to be
astonished too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the
wind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, little woman! To go on, my dear. This rock we must leave
to time, chance, and hopeful circumstance. We must not shipwreck Ada
upon it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) cannot afford, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) cannot afford, the remotest chance
of another separation from a friend. Therefore I have particularly
begged of Woodcourt, and I now particularly beg of you, my dear, not
to move this subject with Rick. Let it rest. Next week, next month,
next year, sooner or later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) will see me with clearer eyes. I can
wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I had already discussed it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), I confessed; and so, I
thought, had Mr. Woodcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) tells me,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``Very good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>) has made his (<font color='blue'><b>Rick</b></font>)
protest, and Dame Durden has made hers, and there is nothing more to
be said about it. Now I come to Mrs. Woodcourt. How do you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>),
my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In answer to this question, which was oddly abrupt, I said I liked
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) very much and thought she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was more agreeable than she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) used to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so too,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``Less pedigree? Not so much of
Morgan ap--what's his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>That was what I meant, I acknowledged, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was a very harmless
person, even when we had had more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, upon the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) is as well in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) native mountains,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said
my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``I agree with you. Then, little woman, can I do better
for a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No. And yet--

<p/>My guardian looked at me, waiting for what I had to say.

<p/>I had nothing to say. At least I had nothing in my mind that I could
say. I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if
we had had some other inmate, but I could hardly have explained why
even to myself. Or, if to myself, certainly not to anybody else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``our neighbourhood is in Woodcourt's
way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) can come here to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) likes, which is
agreeable to them both; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) is familiar to us and fond of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes. That was undeniable. I had nothing to say against it. I could
not have suggested a better arrangement, but I was not quite easy in
my mind. Esther, Esther, why not? Esther, think!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very good plan indeed, dear guardian, and we could not do
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, little woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Quite sure. I had had a moment's time to think, since I had urged
that duty on myself, and I was quite sure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``It shall be done. Carried unanimously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carried unanimously,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, going on with my work.

<p/>It was a cover for his (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) book-table that I happened to be ornamenting.
It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never
resumed. I showed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) admired it highly. After I
had explained the pattern to him (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) and all the great effects that were
to come out by and by, I thought I would go back to our last theme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said, dear guardian, when we spoke of Mr. Woodcourt before Ada
left us, that you thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would give a long trial to another
country. Have you been advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, little woman, pretty often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) decided to do so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some other prospect has opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>), perhaps?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--yes--perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, beginning his (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) answer in a
very deliberate manner. <div class="bookquote">``About half a year hence or so, there is a
medical attendant for the poor to be appointed at a certain place in
Yorkshire. It is a thriving place, pleasantly situated--streams and
streets, town and country, mill and moor--and seems to present an
opening for such a man. I mean a man whose hopes and aims may
sometimes lie -LRB-as most men's sometimes do, I dare say-RRB- above the
ordinary level, but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough
after all if it should prove to be a way of usefulness and good
service leading to no other. All generous spirits are ambitious, I
suppose, but the ambition that calmly trusts itself to such a road,
instead of spasmodically trying to fly over it, is of the kind I care
for. It is Woodcourt's kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) get this appointment?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``not being an
oracle, I cannot confidently say, but I think so. His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) reputation
stands very high; there were people from that part of the country in
the shipwreck; and strange to say, I believe the best man has the
best chance. You must not suppose it to be a fine endowment. It is a
very, very commonplace affair, my dear, an appointment to a great
amount of work and a small amount of pay; but better things will
gather about it, it may be fairly hoped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor of that place will have reason to bless the choice if it
falls on Mr. Woodcourt, guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, little woman; that I am sure they will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We said no more about it, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) say a word about the future of
Bleak House. But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>)
side in my mourning dress, and that accounted for it, I considered.

<p/>I now began to visit my dear girl every day in the dull dark corner
where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lived. The morning was my usual time, but whenever I found
I had an hour or so to spare, I put on my bonnet and bustled off to
Chancery Lane. They were both so glad to see me at all hours, and
used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming
in -LRB-being quite at home, I never knocked-RRB-, that I had no fear of
becoming troublesome just yet.

<p/>On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent. At other times
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), so covered with papers, which was never disturbed. Sometimes I
would come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes's office.
Sometimes I would meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in the neighbourhood lounging about and
biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) nails. I often met him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wandering in Lincoln's Inn, near
the place where I had first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), oh how different, how
different!

<p/>That the money Ada brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was melting away with the candles I
used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes's office I knew very
well. It was not a large amount in the beginning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) had married in
debt, and I could not fail to understand, by this time, what was
meant by Mr. Vholes's shoulder being at the wheel--as I still heard
it was. My dear made the best of housekeepers and tried hard to save,
but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) adorned
and graced it so that it became another place. Paler than she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had
been at home, and a little quieter than I had thought natural when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was yet so cheerful and hopeful, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face was so unshadowed that
I half believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) was blinded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) love for Richard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
ruinous career.

<p/>I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression.
As I turned into Symond's Inn, I met little Miss Flite coming out.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) still called them, and had derived the highest gratification from
that ceremony. Ada had already told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) called every Monday
at five o'clock, with one little extra white bow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bonnet, which
never appeared there at any other time, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) largest reticule
of documents on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``So delighted! How do you do! So glad to see
you. And you are going to visit our interesting Jarndyce wards? TO be
sure! Our beauty is at home, my dear, and will be charmed to see
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Richard is not come in yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that, for I
was afraid of being a little late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is not come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Flite. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has had a long day
in court. I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) there with Vholes. You don't like Vholes, I
hope? DON<div class="bookquote">``T like Vholes. Dan-gerous man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you see Richard oftener than ever now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Flite, <div class="bookquote">``daily and hourly. You know what I
told you of the attraction on the Chancellor's table? My dear, next
to myself he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) is the most constant suitor in court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) begins quite to
amuse our little party. Ve-ry friendly little party, are we not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>It was miserable to hear this from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) poor mad lips, though it was
no surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In short, my valued friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pursued Miss Flite, advancing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lips
to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery, <div class="bookquote">``I must tell
you a secret. I have made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) my executor. Nominated, constituted,
and appointed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). In my will. Ye-es.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>repeated Miss Flite in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) most genteel accents, <div class="bookquote">``my
executor, administrator, and assign. -LRB-Our Chancery phrases, my love.-RRB-
I have reflected that if I should wear out, he (<font color='blue'><b>administrator</b></font>) will be able to watch
that judgment. Being so very regular in his (<font color='blue'><b>administrator</b></font>) attendance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>It made me sigh to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did at one time mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Flite, echoing the sigh, <div class="bookquote">``to
nominate, constitute, and appoint poor Gridley. Also very regular, my
charming girl. I assure you, most exemplary! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) wore out, poor
man, so I have appointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gridley</b></font>) successor. Don't mention it. This is in
confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) carefully opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) reticule a little way and showed me a folded
piece of paper inside as the appointment of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another secret, my dear. I have added to my collection of birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Miss Flite?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, knowing how it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
confidence received with an appearance of interest.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) nodded several times, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) face became overcast and gloomy.
<div class="bookquote">``Two more. I call them the Wards in Jarndyce. They are caged up with
all the others. With Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust,
Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin, Despair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly,
Words, Wigs, Rags, Sheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and
Spinach!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) and went her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) way. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) manner of running over the names of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
birds, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) were afraid of hearing them even from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) own lips,
quite chilled me.

<p/>This was not a cheering preparation for my visit, and I could have
dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes, when Richard -LRB-who arrived
within a minute or two after me-RRB- brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to share our dinner.
Although it was a very plain one, Ada and Richard were for some
minutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what we
were to eat and drink. Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a
little conversation in a low voice with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) came to the window
where I was sitting and began upon Symond's Inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A dull place, Miss Summerson, for a life that is not an official
one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, smearing the glass with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) black glove to
make it clearer for me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is not much to see here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor to hear, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Vholes. <div class="bookquote">``A little music does
occasionally stray in, but we are not musical in the law and soon
eject it. I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) friends could wish
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked Mr. Vholes and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was quite well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the pleasure to be admitted among the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
friends myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, <div class="bookquote">``and I am aware that the gentlemen
of our profession are sometimes regarded in such quarters with an
unfavourable eye. Our plain course, however, under good report and
evil report, and all kinds of prejudice -LRB-we are the victims of
prejudice-RRB-, is to have everything openly carried on. How do you find
Mr. C. looking, Miss Summerson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looks very ill. Dreadfully anxious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) stood behind me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) long black figure reaching nearly to the
ceiling of those low rooms, feeling the pimples on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) face as if
they were ornaments and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there
were not a human passion or emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Woodcourt is in attendance upon Mr. C., I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Woodcourt is his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) disinterested friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I mean in professional attendance, medical attendance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That can do little for an unhappy mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes.

<p/>So slow, so eager, so bloodless and gaunt, I felt as if Richard were
wasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were
something of the vampire in him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, very slowly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) gloved
hands, as if, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) cold sense of touch, they were much the same in
black kid or out of it, <div class="bookquote">``this was an ill-advised marriage of Mr.
C.'s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>kid</b></font>)</div><p/>I begged he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) would excuse me from discussing it. They had been engaged
when they were both very young, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) -LRB-a little indignantly-RRB- and
when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter. When
Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now
darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>assented Mr. Vholes again. ``Still, with a view to
everything being openly carried on, I will, with your permission,
Miss Summerson, observe to you that I consider this a very
ill-advised marriage indeed. I owe the opinion not only to Mr. C.<div class="bookquote">``s
connexions, against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself,
but also to my own reputation--dear to myself as a professional man
aiming to keep respectable; dear to my three girls at home, for whom
I am striving to realize some little independence; dear, I will even
say, to my aged father, whom it is my privilege to support.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would become a very different marriage, a much happier and better
marriage, another marriage altogether, Mr. Vholes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``if
Richard were persuaded to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) back on the fatal pursuit in which
you are engaged with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vholes, with a noiseless cough--or rather gasp--into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
black gloves, inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) head as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) did not wholly dispute even
that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) said, ``it may be so; and I freely admit that the
young lady who has taken Mr. C.``s name upon herself in so ill-advised
a manner--you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out
that remark again, as a duty I owe to Mr. C.``s connexions--is a
highly genteel young lady. Business has prevented me from mixing much
with general society in any but a professional character; still I
trust I am competent to perceive that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a highly genteel young
lady. As to beauty, I am not a judge of that myself, and I never did
give much attention to it from a boy, but I dare say the young lady
is equally eligible in that point of view. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is considered so -LRB-I
have heard-RRB- among the clerks in the Inn, and it is a point more in
their way than in mine. In reference to Mr. C.<div class="bookquote">``s pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>)
interests--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! His (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) interests, Mr. Vholes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Vholes, going on in exactly the same inward
and dispassionate manner. ``Mr. C. takes certain interests under
certain wills disputed in the suit. It is a term we use. In reference
to Mr. C,``s pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) interests, I mentioned to you, Miss
Summerson, the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you, in my
desire that everything should be openly carried on--I used those
words, for I happened afterwards to note them in my diary, which is
producible at any time--I mentioned to you that Mr. C. had laid down
the principle of watching his (<font color='blue'><b>C.</b></font>) own interests, and that when a client
of mine laid down a principle which was not of an immoral -LRB-that is to
say, unlawful-RRB- nature, it devolved upon me to carry it out. I HAVE
carried it out; I do carry it out. But I will not smooth things over
to any connexion of Mr. C.``s on any account. As open as I was to Mr.
Jarndyce, I am to you. I regard it in the light of a professional
duty to be so, though it can be charged to no one. I openly say,
unpalatable as it may be, that I consider Mr. C.<div class="bookquote">``s affairs in a very
bad way, that I consider Mr. C. himself in a very bad way, and that I
regard this as an exceedingly ill-advised marriage. Am I here, sir?
Yes, I thank you; I am here, Mr. C., and enjoying the pleasure of
some agreeable conversation with Miss Summerson, for which I have to
thank you very much, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) broke off thus in answer to Richard, who addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) came
into the room. By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes's
scrupulous way of saving himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) respectability not to feel
that our worst fears did but keep pace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) client's progress.

<p/>We sat down to dinner, and I had an opportunity of observing Richard,
anxiously. I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes -LRB-who took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) gloves
to dine-RRB-, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) sat opposite to me at the small table, for I
doubt if, looking up at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) once removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) host's
face. I found Richard thin and languid, slovenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) dress,
abstracted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) manner, forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) spirits now and then, and at
other intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness. About his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) large
bright eyes that used to be so merry there was a wanness and a
restlessness that changed them altogether. I cannot use the
expression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) looked old. There is a ruin of youth which is not
like age, and into such a ruin Richard's youth and youthful beauty
had all fallen away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) ate little and seemed indifferent what it was, showed himself to
be much more impatient than he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) used to be, and was quick even with
Ada. I thought at first that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) old light-hearted manner was all
gone, but it shone out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sometimes as I had occasionally known
little momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from
the glass. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) laugh had not quite left him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) either, but it was like
the echo of a joyful sound, and that is always sorrowful.

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was as glad as ever, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) old affectionate way, to have me
there, and we talked of the old times pleasantly. These did not
appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) occasionally made a
gasp which I believe was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) rose shortly after dinner and
said that with the permission of the ladies he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) would retire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always devoted to business, Vholes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>cried Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. C.,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``the interests of clients are never to be
neglected, sir. They are paramount in the thoughts of a professional
man like myself, who wishes to preserve a good name among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fellow-practitioners and society at large. My denying myself the
pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly
irrespective of your own interests, Mr. C.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes
out. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) return he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) told us, more than once, that Vholes was a good
fellow, a safe fellow, a man who did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) pretended to do, a very
good fellow indeed! He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was so defiant about it that it struck me he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) threw himself on the sofa, tired out; and Ada and I put
things to rights, for they had no other servant than the woman who
attended to the chambers. My dear girl had a cottage piano there and
quietly sat down to sing some of Richard's favourites, the lamp being
first removed into the next room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) complained of its hurting his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/>I sat between them, at my dear girl's side, and felt very melancholy
listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sweet voice. I think Richard did too; I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
darkened the room for that reason. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been singing some time,
rising between whiles to bend over him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), when Mr.
Woodcourt came in. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) sat down by Richard and half playfully,
half earnestly, quite naturally and easily, found out how he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) felt and
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had been all day. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) proposed to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in
a short walk on one of the bridges, as it was a moonlight airy night;
and Richard readily consenting, they went out together.

<p/>They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano and me still
sitting beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). When they were gone out, I drew my arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left hand in mine -LRB-I was sitting on that side-RRB-,
but kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right upon the keys, going over and over them without
striking any note.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, my dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, breaking silence, <div class="bookquote">``Richard is never
so well and I am never so easy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is with Allan
Woodcourt. We have to thank you for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be, because Mr.
Woodcourt had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin John's house and had known us all
there, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had always liked Richard, and Richard had
always liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), and--and so forth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div>said Ada, <div class="bookquote">``but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is such a devoted friend to us we
owe to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ada/Miss Clare/Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought it best to let my dear girl have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way and to say no more
about it. So I said as much. I said it lightly, because I felt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esther, my dearest, I want to be a good wife, a very, very good wife
indeed. You shall teach me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I teach! I said no more, for I noticed the hand that was fluttering
over the keys, and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak, that
it was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who had something to say to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I married Richard I was not insensible to what was before him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
I had been perfectly happy for a long time with you, and I had never
known any trouble or anxiety, so loved and cared for, but I
understood the danger he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was in, dear Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know, my darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When we were married I had some little hope that I might be able to
convince him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mistake, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might come to regard it in a new
way as my husband and not pursue it all the more desperately for my
sake--as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does. But if I had not had that hope, I would have
married him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) just the same, Esther. Just the same!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still--a
firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words, and dying
away with them--I saw the confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) earnest tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not to think, my dearest Esther, that I fail to see what you
see and fear what you fear. No one can understand him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) better than I
do. The greatest wisdom that ever lived in the world could scarcely
know Richard better than my love does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke so modestly and softly and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trembling hand expressed
such agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes! My dear,
dear girl!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) worst every day. I watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sleep. I know
every change of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face. But when I married Richard I was quite
determined, Esther, if heaven would help me, never to show him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that I
grieved for what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did and so to make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) more unhappy. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) comes home, to find no trouble in my face. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), when
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looks at me, to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loved in me. I married him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to do this,
and this supports me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trembling more. I waited for what was yet to come, and I
now thought I began to know what it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And something else supports me, Esther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopped a minute. Stopped speaking only; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand was still in
motion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I look forward a little while, and I don't know what great aid may
come to me. When Richard turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) eyes upon me then, there may be
something lying on my breast more eloquent than I have been, with
greater power than mine to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) true course and win him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand stopped now. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clasped me in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms, and I clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
in mine.

<p/>``If that little creature should fail too, Esther, I still look
forward. I look forward a long while, through years and years, and
think that then, when I am growing old, or when I am dead perhaps, a
beautiful woman, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) daughter, happily married, may be proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
and a blessing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Or that a generous brave man, as handsome as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to be, as hopeful, and far more happy, may walk in the
sunshine with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), honouring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grey head and saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I
thank God this is my father! Ruined by a fatal inheritance, and
restored through me!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, my sweet girl, what a heart was that which beat so fast against
me!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These hopes uphold me, my dear Esther, and I know they will. Though
sometimes even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I
look at Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I tried to cheer my darling, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) what it was. Sobbing and
weeping, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) may not live to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) child.''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXI

<p/>A Discovery


<p/>The days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl
brightened can never fade in my remembrance. I never see it, and I
never wish to see it now; I have been there only once since, but in
my memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place which will
shine for ever.

<p/>Not a day passed without my going there, of course. At first I found
Mr. Skimpole there, on two or three occasions, idly playing the piano
and talking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) usual vivacious strain. Now, besides my very much
mistrusting the probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) being there without making Richard
poorer, I felt as if there were something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) careless gaiety too
inconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada's life. I clearly
perceived, too, that Ada shared my feelings. I therefore resolved,
after much thinking of it, to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole
and try delicately to explain myself. My dear girl was the great
consideration that made me bold.

<p/>I set off one morning, accompanied by Charley, for Somers Town. As I
approached the house, I was strongly inclined to turn back, for I
felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr.
Skimpole and how extremely likely it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would signally
defeat me. However, I thought that being there, I would go through
with it. I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole's
door--literally with a hand, for the knocker was gone--and after a
long parley gained admission from an Irishwoman, who was in the area
when I knocked, breaking up the lid of a water-butt with a poker to
light the fire with.

<p/>Mr. Skimpole, lying on the sofa in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) room, playing the flute a
little, was enchanted to see me. Now, who should receive me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
asked. Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies? Would I
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) Comedy daughter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) Beauty daughter, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) Sentiment
daughter? Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect
nosegay?

<p/>I replied, half defeated already, that I wished to speak to himself
only if he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) would give me leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson, most joyfully! Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) said, bringing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) chair nearer mine and breaking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) fascinating smile, <div class="bookquote">``of
course it's not business. Then it's pleasure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I said it certainly was not business that I came upon, but it was not
quite a pleasant matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) with the frankest gaiety,
<div class="bookquote">``don't allude to it. Why should you allude to anything that is NOT a
pleasant matter? I never do. And you are a much pleasanter creature,
in every point of view, than I. You are perfectly pleasant; I am
imperfectly pleasant; then, if I never allude to an unpleasant
matter, how much less should you! So that's disposed of, and we will
talk of something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Although I was embarrassed, I took courage to intimate that I still
wished to pursue the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) airy laugh,
<div class="bookquote">``if I thought Miss Summerson capable of making one. But I don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Skimpole,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, raising my eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have so often
heard you say that you are unacquainted with the common affairs of
life--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meaning our three banking-house friends, L, S, and who's the junior
partner? D?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, brightly. <div class="bookquote">``Not an idea of them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--That perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, <div class="bookquote">``you will excuse my boldness on that
account. I think you ought most seriously to know that Richard is
poorer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``So am I, they tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in very embarrassed circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parallel case, exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted
countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This at present naturally causes Ada much secret anxiety, and as I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is less anxious when no claims are made upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) by
visitors, and as Richard has one uneasiness always heavy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind,
it has occurred to me to take the liberty of saying that--if you
would--not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was coming to the point with great difficulty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) took me by
both hands and with a radiant face and in the liveliest way
anticipated it.

<p/>``Not go there? Certainly not, my dear Miss Summerson, most assuredly
not. Why SHOULD I go there? When I go anywhere, I go for pleasure. I
don't go anywhere for pain, because I was made for pleasure. Pain
comes to ME when it wants me. Now, I have had very little pleasure at
our dear Richard's lately, and your practical sagacity demonstrates
why. Our young friends, losing the youthful poetry which was once so
captivating in them, begin to think, ``This is a man who wants
pounds.'' So I am; I always want pounds; not for myself, but because
tradespeople always want them of me. Next, our young friends begin to
think, becoming mercenary, ``This is the man who HAD pounds, who
borrowed them,<div class="bookquote">'' which I did. I always borrow pounds. So our young
friends, reduced to prose -LRB-which is much to be regretted-RRB-, degenerate
in their power of imparting pleasure to me. Why should I go to see
them, therefore? Absurd!''

 (<font color='red'><b>This the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Through the beaming smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) regarded me as he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) reasoned
thus, there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite
astonishing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) said, pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) argument in his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) tone of
light-hearted conviction, ``if I don't go anywhere for pain--which
would be a perversion of the intention of my being, and a monstrous
thing to do--why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain? If I
went to see our young friends in their present ill-regulated state of
mind, I should give them pain. The associations with me would be
disagreeable. They might say, ``This is the man who had pounds and who
can't pay pounds,<div class="bookquote">'' which I can't, of course; nothing could be more
out of the question! Then kindness requires that I shouldn't go near
them--and I won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>This the man</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) finished by genially kissing my hand and thanking me. Nothing but
Miss Summerson's fine tact, he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) said, would have found this out for
him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>).

<p/>I was much disconcerted, but I reflected that if the main point were
gained, it mattered little how strangely he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) perverted everything
leading to it. I had determined to mention something else, however,
and I thought I was not to be put off in that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Skimpole,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I must take the liberty of saying before I
conclude my visit that I was much surprised to learn, on the best
authority, some little time ago, that you knew with whom that poor
boy left Bleak House and that you accepted a present on that
occasion. I have not mentioned it to my guardian, for I fear it would
hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) unnecessarily; but I may say to you that I was much
surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No? Really surprised, my dear Miss Summerson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) returned
inquiringly, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) pleasant eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Greatly surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and
whimsical expression of face, then quite gave it up and said in his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
most engaging manner, <div class="bookquote">``You know what a child I am. Why surprised?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>I was reluctant to enter minutely into that question, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
begged I would, for he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was really curious to know, I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) to
understand in the gentlest words I could use that his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) conduct seemed
to involve a disregard of several moral obligations. He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was much
amused and interested when he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) heard this and said, <div class="bookquote">``No, really?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with
ingenuous simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I don't intend to be responsible. I never could do it.
Responsibility is a thing that has always been above me--or below
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole. <div class="bookquote">``I don't even know which; but as I understand
the way in which my dear Miss Summerson -LRB-always remarkable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)
practical good sense and clearness-RRB- puts this case, I should imagine
it was chiefly a question of money, do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Then you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``I am
hopeless of understanding it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>I suggested, as I rose to go, that it was not right to betray my
guardian's confidence for a bribe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) returned with a candid hilarity that was
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) own, <div class="bookquote">``I can't be bribed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not by Mr. Bucket?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Not by anybody. I don't attach any value to money. I
don't care about it, I don't know about it, I don't want it, I don't
keep it--it goes away from me directly. How can I be bribed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I showed that I was of a different opinion, though I had not the
capacity for arguing the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Skimpole, <div class="bookquote">``I am exactly the man to be
placed in a superior position in such a case as that. I am above the
rest of mankind in such a case as that. I can act with philosophy in
such a case as that. I am not warped by prejudices, as an Italian
baby is by bandages. I am as free as the air. I feel myself as far
above suspicion as Caesar's wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Skimpole/Skimpole/Harold Skimpole</b></font>)</div><p/>Anything to equal the lightness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) manner and the playful
impartiality with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) seemed to convince himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) tossed
the matter about like a ball of feathers, was surely never seen in
anybody else!

<p/>``Observe the case, my dear Miss Summerson. Here is a boy received
into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to.
The boy being in bed, a man arrives--like the house that Jack built.
Here is the man who demands the boy who is received into the house
and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Here is a
bank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received
into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to.
Here is the Skimpole who accepts the bank-note produced by the man
who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in
a state that I strongly object to. Those are the facts. Very well.
Should the Skimpole have refused the note? WHY should the Skimpole
have refused the note? Skimpole protests to Bucket, ``What's this for?
I don't understand it, it is of no use to me, take it away.<div class="bookquote">'' Bucket
still entreats Skimpole to accept it. Are there reasons why Skimpole,
not being warped by prejudices, should accept it? Yes. Skimpole
perceives them. What are they? Skimpole reasons with himself, this is
a tamed lynx, an active police-officer, an intelligent man, a person
of a peculiarly directed energy and great subtlety both of conception
and execution, who discovers our friends and enemies for us when they
run away, recovers our property for us when we are robbed, avenges us
comfortably when we are murdered. This active police-officer and
intelligent man has acquired, in the exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) art, a strong
faith in money; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds it very useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes it very
useful to society. Shall I shake that faith in Bucket because I want
it myself; shall I deliberately blunt one of Bucket's weapons; shall
I positively paralyse Bucket in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next detective operation? And
again. If it is blameable in Skimpole to take the note, it is
blameable in Bucket to offer the note--much more blameable in Bucket,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is the knowing man. Now, Skimpole wishes to think well of
Bucket; Skimpole deems it essential, in its little place, to the
general cohesion of things, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) SHOULD think well of Bucket. The
state expressly asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) to trust to Bucket. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) does. And that's
all he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) does!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition and therefore took
my leave. Mr. Skimpole, however, who was in excellent spirits, would
not hear of my returning home attended only by <div class="bookquote">``Little Coavinses,''
 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>and accompanied me himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) entertained me on the way with a
variety of delightful conversation and assured me, at parting, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) about our young friends.

<p/>As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again, I may at once
finish what I know of his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) history. A coolness arose between him (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>) and
my guardian, based principally on the foregoing grounds and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skimpole</b></font>)
having heartlessly disregarded my guardian's entreaties -LRB-as we
afterwards learned from Ada-RRB- in reference to Richard. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) being
heavily in my guardian's debt had nothing to do with their
separation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) died some five years afterwards and left a diary
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), with letters and other materials towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) life, which
was published and which showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to have been the victim of a
combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child. It was
considered very pleasant reading, but I never read more of it myself
than the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book. It
was this: <div class="bookquote">``Jarndyce, in common with most other men I have known, is
the incarnation of selfishness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly
indeed, and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance
occurred. Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in
my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as
belonging to a part of my life that was gone--gone like my infancy or
my childhood. I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that
subject, but have written them as faithfully as my memory has
recalled them. And I hope to do, and mean to do, the same down to the
last words of these pages, which I see now not so very far before me.

<p/>The months were gliding away, and my dear girl, sustained by the
hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had confided in me, was the same beautiful star in the
miserable corner. Richard, more worn and haggard, haunted the court
day after day, listlessly sat there the whole day long when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) knew
there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned, and became
one of the stock sights of the place. I wonder whether any of the
gentlemen remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) first went there.

<p/>So completely was he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fixed idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) used to avow
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) cheerful moments that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) should never have breathed the fresh
air now <div class="bookquote">``but for Woodcourt.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could
occasionally divert his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) attention for a few hours at a time and rouse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>), even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed
us greatly, and the returns of which became more frequent as the
months went on. My dear girl was right in saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) only pursued
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) errors the more desperately for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sake. I have no doubt that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) desire to retrieve what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had lost was rendered the more intense
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) grief for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) young wife, and became like the madness of a
gamester.

<p/>I was there, as I have mentioned, at all hours. When I was there at
night, I generally went home with Charley in a coach; sometimes my
guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood, and we would walk home
together. One evening he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock. I
could not leave, as I usually did, quite punctually at the time, for
I was working for my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to
finish what I was about; but it was within a few minutes of the hour
when I bundled up my little work-basket, gave my darling my last kiss
for the night, and hurried downstairs. Mr. Woodcourt went with me, as
it was dusk.

<p/>When we came to the usual place of meeting--it was close by, and Mr.
Woodcourt had often accompanied me before--my guardian was not there.
We waited half an hour, walking up and down, but there were no signs
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). We agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was either prevented from coming or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
had come and gone away, and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with
me.

<p/>It was the first walk we had ever taken together, except that very
short one to the usual place of meeting. We spoke of Richard and Ada
the whole way. I did not thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in words for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had done--my
appreciation of it had risen above all words then--but I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly.

<p/>Arriving at home and going upstairs, we found that my guardian was
out and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too. We were in the very same
room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) youthful
lover, now her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so altered husband, was the choice of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) young heart,
the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them
going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and
promise.

<p/>We were standing by the opened window looking down into the street
when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me. I learned in a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) loved
me. I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and
compassion was devoted, generous, faithful love. Oh, too late to know
it now, too late, too late. That was the first ungrateful thought I
had. Too late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I returned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) told me, <div class="bookquote">``when I came back, no richer than when
I went away, and found you newly risen from a sick bed, yet so
inspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish
thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Woodcourt, forbear, forbear!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I do not
deserve your high praise. I had many selfish thoughts at that time,
many!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven knows, beloved of my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that my praise is not a
lover's praise, but the truth. You do not know what all around you
see in Esther Summerson, how many hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) touches and awakens,
what sacred admiration and what love she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) wins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I, <div class="bookquote">``it is a great thing to win love, it is
a great thing to win love! I am proud of it, and honoured by it; and
the hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and
sorrow--joy that I have won it, sorrow that I have not deserved it
better; but I am not free to think of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said it with a stronger heart, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) praised me thus and when
I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) voice thrill with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) belief that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) said was true,
I aspired to be more worthy of it. It was not too late for that.
Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to-night, I could
be worthier of it all through my life. And it was a comfort to me,
and an impulse to me, and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was
derived from him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) when I thought so.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) broke the silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will
evermore be as dear to me as now'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and the deep earnestness with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) said it at once strengthened me and made me weep--<div class="bookquote">``if, after
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is not free to think of my love, I urged it.
Dear Esther, let me only tell you that the fond idea of you which I
took abroad was exalted to the heavens when I came home. I have
always hoped, in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of
good fortune, to tell you this. I have always feared that I should
tell it you in vain. My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night.
I distress you. I have said enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
thought me, and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had sustained! I
wished to help him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) trouble, as I had wished to do when he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
showed that first commiseration for me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Mr. Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``before we part to-night, something is
left for me to say. I never could say it as I wish--I never
shall--but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had to think again of being more deserving of his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) love and his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
affliction before I could go on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--I am deeply sensible of your generosity, and I shall treasure its
remembrance to my dying hour. I know full well how changed I am, I
know you are not unacquainted with my history, and I know what a
noble love that is which is so faithful. What you have said to me
could have affected me so much from no other lips, for there are none
that could give it such a value to me. It shall not be lost. It shall
make me better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hand and turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) head. How could
I ever be worthy of those tears?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If, in the unchanged intercourse we shall have together--in tending
Richard and Ada, and I hope in many happier scenes of life--you ever
find anything in me which you can honestly think is better than it
used to be, believe that it will have sprung up from to-night and
that I shall owe it to you. And never believe, dear dear Mr.
Woodcourt, never believe that I forget this night or that while my
heart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been
beloved by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) took my hand and kissed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was like himself again, and I felt
still more encouraged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am induced by what you said just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to hope that you
have succeeded in your endeavour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``With such help from Mr. Jarndyce as you who
know him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) so well can imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) to have rendered me, I have
succeeded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) my hand; <div class="bookquote">``and heaven
bless you in all you do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do it better for the wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``it will make me
enter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed involuntarily, <div class="bookquote">``What will he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) do when you
are gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not required to go yet; I would not desert him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), dear Miss
Summerson, even if I were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon before he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) left me. I
knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I
reserved it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you will be glad to know from my lips
before I say good night that in the future, which is clear and bright
before me, I am most happy, most fortunate, have nothing to regret or
desire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was indeed a glad hearing to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From my childhood I have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``the object of the untiring
goodness of the best of human beings, to whom I am so bound by every
tie of attachment, gratitude, and love, that nothing I could do in
the compass of a life could express the feelings of a single day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I share those feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``You speak of Mr. Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) virtues well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but few can know the greatness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) character as I know it. All its highest and best qualities
have been revealed to me in nothing more brightly than in the shaping
out of that future in which I am so happy. And if your highest homage
and respect had not been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) already--which I know they are--they
would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), I think, on this assurance and in the feeling it
would have awakened in you towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) for my sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) fervently replied that indeed indeed they would have been. I gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) my hand again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The first until we meet to-morrow, the second as a farewell to this
theme between us for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night; good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) left me, and I stood at the dark window watching the street. His (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
love, in all its constancy and generosity, had come so suddenly upon
me that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again
and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears.

<p/>But they were not tears of regret and sorrow. No. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had called me
the beloved of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) life and had said I would be evermore as dear to
him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) as I was then, and I felt as if my heart would not hold the
triumph of having heard those words. My first wild thought had died
away. It was not too late to hear them, for it was not too late to be
animated by them to be good, true, grateful, and contented. How easy
my path, how much easier than his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)!




<p/>CHAPTER LXII

<p/>Another Discovery


<p/>I had not the courage to see any one that night. I had not even the
courage to see myself, for I was afraid that my tears might a little
reproach me. I went up to my room in the dark, and prayed in the
dark, and lay down in the dark to sleep. I had no need of any light
to read my guardian's letter by, for I knew it by heart. I took it
from the place where I kept it, and repeated its contents by its own
clear light of integrity and love, and went to sleep with it on my
pillow.

<p/>I was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a
walk. We bought flowers for the breakfast-table, and came back and
arranged them, and were as busy as possible. We were so early that I
had a good time still for Charley's lesson before breakfast; Charley
-LRB-who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of
grammar-RRB- came through it with great applause; and we were altogether
very notable. When my guardian appeared he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why, little woman,
you look fresher than your flowers!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and
translated a passage from the Mewlinnwillinwodd expressive of my
being like a mountain with the sun upon it.

<p/>This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the
mountain than I had been before. After breakfast I waited my
opportunity and peeped about a little until I saw my guardian in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
own room--the room of last night--by himself. Then I made an excuse
to go in with my housekeeping keys, shutting the door after me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Dame Durden?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian; the post had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
several letters, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was writing. <div class="bookquote">``You want money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I have plenty in hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was such a Dame Durden,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``for making
money last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) pen and leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) chair looking at me.
I have often spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) bright face, but I thought I had never
seen it look so bright and good. There was a high happiness upon it
which made me think, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Durden</b></font>) has been doing some great kindness this
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, musing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) smiled upon me,
<div class="bookquote">``such a Dame Durden for making money last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had never yet altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) old manner. I loved it and him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) so much
that when I now went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) and took my usual chair, which was
always put at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) side--for sometimes I read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), and sometimes I
talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), and sometimes I silently worked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)--I hardly liked
to disturb it by laying my hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) breast. But I found I did not
disturb it at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you. Have I been remiss
in anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remiss in anything, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I not been what I have meant to be since--I brought the answer
to your letter, guardian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been everything I could desire, my love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad indeed to hear that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. <div class="bookquote">``You know, you said
to me, was this the mistress of Bleak House. And I said, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) arm about
me as if there were something to protect me from and looked in my
face, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``we have never spoken on the subject except
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then I said Bleak House was thinning fast; and so it was, my
dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I timidly reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but its mistress remained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) still held me in the same protecting manner and with the same
bright goodness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I know how you have felt all that has
happened, and how considerate you have been. As so much time has
passed, and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again,
perhaps you expect me to renew the subject. Perhaps I ought to do so.
I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) returned gaily, <div class="bookquote">``what a sympathy there must be between us!
I have had nothing else, poor Rick excepted--it's a large
exception--in my mind. When you came in, I was full of it. When shall
we give Bleak House its mistress, little woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next month?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next month, dear guardian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life--the
day on which I shall be a man more exulting and more enviable than
any other man in the world--the day on which I give Bleak House its
little mistress--shall be next month then,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/>I put my arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) neck and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) just as I had done on the
day when I brought my answer.

<p/>A servant came to the door to announce Mr. Bucket, which was quite
unnecessary, for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over the servant's
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>), rather out of
breath, <div class="bookquote">``with all apologies for intruding, WILL you allow me to order
up a person that's on the stairs and that objects to being left there
in case of becoming the subject of observations in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) absence? Thank
you. Be so good as chair that there member in this direction, will
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, beckoning over the banisters.

<p/>This singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap,
unable to walk, who was carried up by a couple of bearers and
deposited in the room near the door. Mr. Bucket immediately got rid
of the bearers, mysteriously shut the door, and bolted it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you see, Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) then began, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hat and
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) subject with a flourish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) well-remembered finger,
<div class="bookquote">``you know me, and Miss Summerson knows me. This gentleman likewise
knows me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name is Smallweed. The discounting line is his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) line
principally, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s what you may call a dealer in bills. That's
about what YOU are, you know, ain't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, stopping a
little to address the gentleman in question, who was exceedingly
suspicious of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seemed about to dispute this designation of himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was
seized with a violent fit of coughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, moral, you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, improving the accident.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you contradict when there ain't no occasion, and you won't be
took in that way. Now, Mr. Jarndyce, I address myself to you. I've
been negotiating with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester
Dedlock, Baronet, and one way and another I've been in and out and
about his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) premises a deal. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) premises are the premises formerly
occupied by Krook, marine store dealer--a relation of this
gentleman's that you saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lifetime if I don't mistake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! You are to understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``that this gentleman
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) come into Krook's property, and a good deal of magpie property
there was. Vast lots of waste-paper among the rest. Lord bless you,
of no use to nobody!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>The cunning of Mr. Bucket's eye and the masterly manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
contrived, without a look or a word against which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) watchful
auditor could protest, to let us know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stated the case
according to previous agreement and could say much more of Mr.
Smallweed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) thought it advisable, deprived us of any merit in
quite understanding him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) difficulty was increased by Mr.
Smallweed's being deaf as well as suspicious and watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) face
with the closest attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) comes
into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To which? Say that again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill, sharp
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To rummage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bucket. <div class="bookquote">``Being a prudent man and
accustomed to take care of your own affairs, you begin to rummage
among the papers as you have come into; don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Smallweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket conversationally, <div class="bookquote">``and much to
blame you would be if you didn't. And so you chance to find, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket went on, stooping over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with an air of cheerful
raillery which Mr. Smallweed by no means reciprocated, <div class="bookquote">``and so you
chance to find, you know, a paper with the signature of Jarndyce to
it. Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded
assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And coming to look at that paper at your full leisure and
convenience--all in good time, for you're not curious to read it, and
why should you be?--what do you find it to be but a will, you see.
That's the drollery of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air
of recalling a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed, who still had
the same crest-fallen appearance of not enjoying it at all; <div class="bookquote">``what do
you find it to be but a will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that it's good as a will or as anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>snarled
Mr. Smallweed.

<p/>Mr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had slipped and shrunk
down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) chair into a mere bundle--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) were much disposed to
pounce upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) continued to bend over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with the
same agreeable air, keeping the corner of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes upon us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Notwithstanding which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, <div class="bookquote">``you get a little doubtful
and uncomfortable in your mind about it, having a very tender mind of
your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh? What do you say I have got of my own?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Smallweed with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very tender mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! Well, go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Smallweed.

<p/>``And as you've heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated
Chancery will case of the same name, and as you know what a card
Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of furniter, and books,
and papers, and what not, and never liking to part with 'em, and
always a-going to teach himself to read, you begin to think--and you
never was more correct in your born days--<div class="bookquote">``Ecod, if I don't look
about me, I may get into trouble regarding this will.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mind how you put it, Bucket,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man anxiously with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``Speak up; none of your brimstone tricks. Pick
me up; I want to hear better. Oh, Lord, I am shaken to bits!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bucket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bucket had certainly picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) up at a dart. However, as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) could be heard through Mr. Smallweed's coughing and his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) vicious
ejaculations of <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my bones! Oh, dear! I've no breath in my body!
I'm worse than the chattering, clattering, brimstone pig at home!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bucket proceeded in the same convivial manner as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises,
you take me into your confidence, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill
will and a worse grace than Mr. Smallweed displayed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) admitted
this, rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very
last person he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) would have thought of taking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) confidence if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>)
could by any possibility have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) out of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I go into the business with you--very pleasant we are over it;
and I confirm you in your well-founded fears that you will get
yourself into a most precious line if you don't come out with that
there will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket emphatically; <div class="bookquote">``and accordingly you
arrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr.
Jarndyce, on no conditions. If it should prove to be valuable, you
trusting yourself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) for your reward; that's about where it is,
ain't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what was agreed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Smallweed/Smallweed</b></font>)</div>Mr. Smallweed assented with the same bad
grace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In consequence of which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket, dismissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) agreeable
manner all at once and becoming strictly business-like, <div class="bookquote">``you've got
that will upon your person at the present time, and the only thing
that remains for you to do is just to out with it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eye, and
having given his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) nose one triumphant rub with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) forefinger, Mr.
Bucket stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) eyes fastened on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) confidential friend and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bucket</b></font>) hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my
guardian. It was not produced without much reluctance and many
declarations on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) was a poor
industrious man and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) left it to Mr. Jarndyce's honour not to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) lose by his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) honesty. Little by little he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallweed</b></font>) very slowly took
from a breast-pocket a stained, discoloured paper which was much
singed upon the outside and a little burnt at the edges, as if it had
long ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily snatched off again. Mr.
Bucket lost no time in transferring this paper, with the dexterity of
a conjuror, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) gave it to my
guardian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) whispered behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``Hadn't settled how to
make their market of it. Quarrelled and hinted about it. I laid out
twenty pound upon it. First the avaricious grandchildren split upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) on account of their objections to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) living so unreasonably
long, and then they split on one another. Lord! There ain't one of
the family that wouldn't sell the other for a pound or two, except
the old lady--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s only out of it because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s too weak in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
mind to drive a bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Bucket,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian aloud, <div class="bookquote">``whatever the worth of this
paper may be to any one, my obligations are great to you; and if it
be of any worth, I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed remunerated
accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not according to your merits, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bucket in friendly
explanation to Mr. Smallweed. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you be afraid of that. According
to its value.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``You may observe, Mr.
Bucket, that I abstain from examining this paper myself. The plain
truth is, I have forsworn and abjured the whole business these many
years, and my soul is sick of it. But Miss Summerson and I will
immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the
cause, and its existence shall be made known without delay to all
other parties interested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce can't say fairer than that, you understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>observed
Mr. Bucket to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fellow-visitor. <div class="bookquote">``And it being now made clear to you
that nobody's a-going to be wronged--which must be a great relief to
YOUR mind--we may proceed with the ceremony of chairing you home
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) unbolted the door, called in the bearers, wished us good morning,
and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) finger at parting
went his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) way.

<p/>We went our way too, which was to Lincoln's Inn, as quickly as
possible. Mr. Kenge was disengaged, and we found him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) table in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) dusty room with the inexpressive-looking books and the piles of
papers. Chairs having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy, Mr. Kenge
expressed the surprise and gratification he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) felt at the unusual sight
of Mr. Jarndyce in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) turned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) double eye-glass as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) spoke and was more Conversation Kenge than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, <div class="bookquote">``that the genial influence of Miss
Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) bowed to me, <div class="bookquote">``may have induced Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) bowed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to forego some little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) animosity towards a cause and
towards a court which are--shall I say, which take their place in the
stately vista of the pillars of our profession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am inclined to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``that Miss Summerson
has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to exert
any influence in their favour. Nevertheless, they are a part of the
occasion of my being here. Mr. Kenge, before I lay this paper on your
desk and have done with it, let me tell you how it has come into my
hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) did so shortly and distinctly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It could not, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, <div class="bookquote">``have been stated more plainly
and to the purpose if it had been a case at law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever know English law, or equity either, plain and to the
purpose?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge.

<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had not seemed to attach much importance to the paper,
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) saw it he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) appeared more interested, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had
opened and read a little of it through his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) eye-glass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) became
amazed. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarndyce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) said, looking off it, <div class="bookquote">``you have perused
this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, <div class="bookquote">``it is a will of later date than
any in the suit. It appears to be all in the testator's handwriting.
It is duly executed and attested. And even if intended to be
cancelled, as might possibly be supposed to be denoted by these marks
of fire, it is NOT cancelled. Here it is, a perfect instrument!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``What is that to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Guppy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Kenge, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,
Mr. Jarndyce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn. My compliments. Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
Glad to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ask me what is this to you, Mr. Jarndyce. If you had perused
this document, you would have seen that it reduces your interest
considerably, though still leaving it a very handsome one, still
leaving it a very handsome one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) hand
persuasively and blandly. <div class="bookquote">``You would further have seen that the
interests of Mr. Richard Carstone and of Miss Ada Clare, now Mrs.
Richard Carstone, are very materially advanced by it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kenge,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``if all the flourishing wealth that the
suit brought into this vile court of Chancery could fall to my two
young cousins, I should be well contented. But do you ask ME to
believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, really, Mr. Jarndyce! Prejudice, prejudice. My dear sir, this is
a very great country, a very great country. Its system of equity is a
very great system, a very great system. Really, really!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian said no more, and Mr. Vholes arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was modestly
impressed by Mr. Kenge's professional eminence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Vholes? Will you be so good as to take a chair
here by me and look over this paper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vholes did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was asked and seemed to read it every word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
was not excited by it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) was not excited by anything. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>)
had well examined it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) retired with Mr. Kenge into a window, and
shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) black glove, spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) at some length.
I was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) said before he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had said much, for I knew that no two people ever
did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) seemed
to get the better of Mr. Kenge too in a conversation that sounded
as if it were almost composed of the words <div class="bookquote">``Receiver-General,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Accountant-General,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``report,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``estate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``costs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>When they had
finished, they came back to Mr. Kenge's table and spoke aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! But this is a very remarkable document, Mr. Vholes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Kenge.

<p/>Mr. Vholes said, <div class="bookquote">``Very much so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a very important document, Mr. Vholes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge.

<p/>Again Mr. Vholes said, <div class="bookquote">``Very much so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as you say, Mr. Vholes, when the cause is in the paper next
term, this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, looking loftily at my guardian.

<p/>Mr. Vholes was gratified, as a smaller practitioner striving to keep
respectable, to be confirmed in any opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) own by such an
authority.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>asked my guardian, rising after a pause, during which Mr.
Kenge had rattled his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) money and Mr. Vholes had picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) pimples,
<div class="bookquote">``when is next term?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next term, Mr. Jarndyce, will be next month,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this
document and to collect the necessary evidence concerning it; and of
course you will receive our usual notification of the cause being in
the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To which I shall pay, of course, my usual attention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still bent, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, showing us through the
outer office to the door, <div class="bookquote">``still bent, even with your enlarged mind,
on echoing a popular prejudice? We are a prosperous community, Mr.
Jarndyce, a very prosperous community. We are a great country, Mr.
Jarndyce, we are a very great country. This is a great system, Mr.
Jarndyce, and would you wish a great country to have a little system?
Now, really, really!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) said this at the stair-head, gently moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) right hand as if it
were a silver trowel with which to spread the cement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) words on
the structure of the system and consolidate it for a thousand ages.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIII

<p/>Steel and Iron


<p/>George's Shooting Gallery is to let, and the stock is sold off, and
George himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
rides and riding very near his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bridle-rein because of the uncertain
hand with which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) guides his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) horse. But not to-day is George so
occupied. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is journeying to-day into the iron country farther north
to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comes into the iron country farther north, such fresh green
woods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind; and coal pits and
ashes, high chimneys and red bricks, blighted verdure, scorching
fires, and a heavy never-lightening cloud of smoke become the
features of the scenery. Among such objects rides the trooper,
looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) and always looking for something he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) has come to
find.

<p/>At last, on the black canal bridge of a busy town, with a clang of
iron in it, and more fires and more smoke than he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) has seen yet, the
trooper, swart with the dust of the coal roads, checks his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) horse and
asks a workman does he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) know the name of Rouncewell thereabouts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>the workman</b></font>)</div>quoth the workman, <div class="bookquote">``do I know my own name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the workman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis so well known here, is it, comrade?''  (<font color='red'><b>the workman</b></font>)</div>asks the trooper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rouncewell's? Ah! You're right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where might it be now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>asks the trooper with a glance before
him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bank, the factory, or the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>the workman</b></font>)</div>the workman wants to know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum! Rouncewell's is so great apparently,''  (<font color='red'><b>mutters the trooper</b></font>)</div>mutters the trooper,
stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) chin, <div class="bookquote">``that I have as good as half a mind to go back
again. Why, I don't know which I want. Should I find Mr. Rouncewell
at the factory, do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mutters the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tain't easy to say where you'd find him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)--at this time of the day you
might find either him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) son there, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)'s in town; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>)
contracts take him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And which is the factory? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) sees those chimneys--the tallest
ones! Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) sees THEM. Well! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) keep his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) eye on those
chimneys, going on as straight as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) can, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>)'ll
see 'em down a turning on the left, shut in by a great brick wall
which forms one side of the street. That's Rouncewell's.

<p/>The trooper thanks his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) informant and rides slowly on, looking about
him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) does not turn back, but puts up his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) horse -LRB-and is much
disposed to groom him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) too-RRB- at a public-house where some of
Rouncewell's hands are dining, as the ostler tells him (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>). Some of
Rouncewell's hands have just knocked off for dinner-time and seem to
be invading the whole town. They are very sinewy and strong, are
Rouncewell's hands--a little sooty too.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>) comes to a gateway in the brick wall, looks in, and sees a great
perplexity of iron lying about in every stage and in a vast variety
of shapes--in bars, in wedges, in sheets; in tanks, in boilers, in
axles, in wheels, in cogs, in cranks, in rails; twisted and wrenched
into eccentric and perverse forms as separate parts of machinery;
mountains of it broken up, and rusty in its age; distant furnaces of
it glowing and bubbling in its youth; bright fireworks of it
showering about under the blows of the steam-hammer; red-hot iron,
white-hot iron, cold-black iron; an iron taste, an iron smell, and a
Babel of iron sounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a place to make a man's head ache too!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper,
looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) for a counting-house. <div class="bookquote">``Who comes here? This is very
like me before I was set up. This ought to be my nephew, if
likenesses run in families. Your servant, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours, sir. Are you looking for any one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me. Young Mr. Rouncewell, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was looking for your father, sir. I wish to have a word with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is fortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) choice of a time,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father is there, leads the way to the office where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to
be found. <div class="bookquote">``Very like me before I was set up--devilish like me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>thinks the trooper as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) follows. They come to a building in the yard
with an office on an upper floor. At sight of the gentleman in the
office, Mr. George turns very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What name shall I say to my father?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asks the young man.

<p/>George, full of the idea of iron, in desperation answers <div class="bookquote">``Steel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>and
is so presented. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is left alone with the gentleman in the office,
who sits at a table with account-books before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and some sheets of
paper blotted with hosts of figures and drawings of cunning shapes.
It is a bare office, with bare windows, looking on the iron view
below. Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron,
purposely broken to be tested at various periods of their service, in
various capacities. There is iron-dust on everything; and the smoke
is seen through the windows rolling heavily out of the tall chimneys
to mingle with the smoke from a vaporous Babylon of other chimneys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am at your service, Mr. Steel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the gentleman when his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
visitor has taken a rusty chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Rouncewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div>George replies, leaning forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left
arm on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knee and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand, and very chary of meeting
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's eye, <div class="bookquote">``I am not without my expectations that in the
present visit I may prove to be more free than welcome. I have served
as a dragoon in my day, and a comrade of mine that I was once rather
partial to was, if I don't deceive myself, a brother of yours. I
believe you had a brother who gave his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) family some trouble, and ran
away, and never did any good but in keeping away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div>returns the ironmaster in an altered voice,
<div class="bookquote">``that your name is Steel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div><p/>The trooper falters and looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) brother starts up, calls
him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) name, and grasps him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) by both hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too quick for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>cries the trooper with the tears
springing out of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, my dear old fellow? I
never could have thought you would have been half so glad to see me
as all this. How do you do, my dear old fellow, how do you do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper coupling fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>They shake hands and embrace each other over and over again, the
trooper still coupling his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, my dear old fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper coupling fellow</b></font>)</div>with
his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) protestation that he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) never thought his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) brother would have been
half so glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) as all this!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far from it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) declares at the end of a full account of what
has preceded his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) arrival there, <div class="bookquote">``I had very little idea of making
myself known. I thought if you took by any means forgivingly to my
name I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a
letter. But I should not have been surprised, brother, if you had
considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will show you at home what kind of news we think it, George,''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>returns his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``This is a great day at home, and you could not
have arrived, you bronzed old soldier, on a better. I make an
agreement with my son Watt to-day that on this day twelvemonth he (<font color='blue'><b>Watt</b></font>)
shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your
travels. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes to Germany to-morrow with one of your nieces for a
little polishing up in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) education. We make a feast of the event,
and you will be made the hero of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. George/George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
resists the proposed honour with great earnestness. Being overborne,
however, by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nephew--concerning whom he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) renews his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
protestations that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) never could have thought they would have been
half so glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is taken home to an elegant house in all
the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture
of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as
are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their
children. Here Mr. George is much dismayed by the graces and
accomplishments of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nieces that are and by the beauty of Rosa, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>)
niece that is to be, and by the affectionate salutations of these
young ladies, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) receives in a sort of dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) is sorely
taken aback, too, by the dutiful behaviour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) nephew and has a
woeful consciousness upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) of being a scapegrace. However, there
is great rejoicing and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment,
and Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pledge
to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received
with universal favour. A whirling head has Mr. George that night when
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lies down in the state-bed of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's house to think of all
these things and to see the images of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nieces -LRB-awful all the
evening in their floating muslins-RRB- waltzing, after the German manner,
over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) counterpane.

<p/>The brothers are closeted next morning in the ironmaster's room,
where the elder is proceeding, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) clear sensible way, to show how
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) may best dispose of George in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) business, when George
squeezes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand and stops him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother, I thank you a million times for your more than brotherly
welcome, and a million times more to that for your more than
brotherly intentions. But my plans are made. Before I say a word as
to them, I wish to consult you upon one family point. How,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper arms</b></font>)</div>says the
trooper, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms and looking with indomitable firmness at
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother, <div class="bookquote">``how is my mother to be got to scratch me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I understand you, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div>replies the
ironmaster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, brother, how is my mother to be got to scratch me? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must
be got to do it somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scratch you out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will, I think you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. In short,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) arms more
resolutely yet, <div class="bookquote">``I mean--TO--scratch me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear George,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>returns his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) brother, <div class="bookquote">``is it so indispensable that
you should undergo that process?''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite! Absolutely! I couldn't be guilty of the meanness of coming
back without it. I should never be safe not to be off again. I have
not sneaked home to rob your children, if not yourself, brother, of
your rights. I, who forfeited mine long ago! If I am to remain and
hold up my head, I must be scratched. Come. You are a man of
celebrated penetration and intelligence, and you can tell me how it's
to be brought about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div>replies the ironmaster deliberately, <div class="bookquote">``how
it is not to be brought about, which I hope may answer the purpose as
well. Look at our mother, think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), recall her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) emotion when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
recovered you. Do you believe there is a consideration in the world
that would induce her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to take such a step against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) favourite son?
Do you believe there is any chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) consent, to balance against
the outrage it would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) -LRB-loving dear old lady!-RRB- to propose it?
If you do, you are wrong. No, George! You must make up your mind to
remain UNscratched, I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmaster</b></font>)</div>There is an amused smile on the
ironmaster's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) watches his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) brother, who is pondering, deeply
disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing
were done, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How, brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Being bent upon it, you can dispose by will of anything you have the
misfortune to inherit in any way you like, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper, pondering again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) wistfully
asks, with his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) brother's, <div class="bookquote">``Would you mind mentioning
that, brother, to your wife and family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. You wouldn't object to say, perhaps, that although an
undoubted vagabond, I am a vagabond of the harum-scarum order, and
not of the mean sort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ironmaster</b></font>)</div><p/>The ironmaster, repressing his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) amused smile, assents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Thank you. It's a weight off my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>says the trooper
with a heave of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) chest as he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) unfolds his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) arms and puts a hand on
each leg, <div class="bookquote">``though I had set my heart on being scratched, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The brothers are very like each other, sitting face to face; but a
certain massive simplicity and absence of usage in the ways of the
world is all on the trooper's side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) proceeds, throwing off his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) disappointment, <div class="bookquote">``next and last,
those plans of mine. You have been so brotherly as to propose to me
to fall in here and take my place among the products of your
perseverance and sense. I thank you heartily. It's more than
brotherly, as I said before, and I thank you heartily for it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) a long time by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``But the truth is, brother, I am
a--I am a kind of a weed, and it's too late to plant me in a regular
garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear George,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>returns the elder, concentrating his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) strong steady
brow upon him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) and smiling confidently, <div class="bookquote">``leave that to me, and let me
try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>George shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You could do it, I have not a doubt, if
anybody could; but it's not to be done. Not to be done, sir! Whereas
it so falls out, on the other hand, that I am able to be of some
trifle of use to Sir Leicester Dedlock since his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) illness--brought on
by family sorrows--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would rather have that help from our
mother's son than from anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the other with a very slight shade
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) open face, <div class="bookquote">``if you prefer to serve in Sir Leicester
Dedlock's household brigade--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trooper</b></font>)</div>cries the trooper, checking him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knee again; <div class="bookquote">``there it is! You don't take kindly to that
idea; I don't mind it. You are not used to being officered; I am.
Everything about you is in perfect order and discipline; everything
about me requires to be kept so. We are not accustomed to carry
things with the same hand or to look at 'em from the same point. I
don't say much about my garrison manners because I found myself
pretty well at my ease last night, and they wouldn't be noticed here,
I dare say, once and away. But I shall get on best at Chesney Wold,
where there's more room for a weed than there is here; and the dear
old lady will be made happy besides. Therefore I accept of Sir
Leicester Dedlock's proposals. When I come over next year to give
away the bride, or whenever I come, I shall have the sense to keep
the household brigade in ambuscade and not to manoeuvre it on your
ground. I thank you heartily again and am proud to think of the
Rouncewells as they'll be founded by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know yourself, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>says the elder brother, returning the
grip of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps you know me better than I know myself.
Take your way. So that we don't quite lose one another again, take
your way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No fear of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>returns the trooper</b></font>)</div>returns the trooper. <div class="bookquote">``Now, before I turn my
horse's head homewards, brother, I will ask you--if you'll be so
good--to look over a letter for me. I brought it with me to send from
these parts, as Chesney Wold might be a painful name just now to the
person it's written to. I am not much accustomed to correspondence
myself, and I am particular respecting this present letter because I
want it to be both straightforward and delicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Herewith he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hands a letter, closely written in somewhat pale ink but
in a neat round hand, to the ironmaster, who reads as follows:


<p/>Miss Esther Summerson,

<p/>A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket
of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a
certain person, I take the liberty to make known to you
that it was but a few lines of instruction from abroad,
when, where, and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a
young and beautiful lady, then unmarried, in England. I
duly observed the same.

<p/>I further take the liberty to make known to you that it
was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that
otherwise I would not have given it up, as appearing to
be the most harmless in my possession, without being
previously shot through the heart.

<p/>I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have
supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in
existence, I never could and never would have rested until
I had discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) retreat and shared my last farthing
with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), as my duty and my inclination would have equally
been. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was -LRB-officially-RRB- reported drowned, and
assuredly went over the side of a transport-ship at night
in an Irish harbour within a few hours of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arrival from
the West Indies, as I have myself heard both from officers
and men on board, and know to have been -LRB-officially-RRB-
confirmed.

<p/>I further take the liberty to state that in my humble
quality as one of the rank and file, I am, and shall ever
continue to be, your thoroughly devoted and admiring
servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above
all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch.

<p/>I have the honour to be,

<p/>GEORGE


<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little formal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>observes the elder brother, refolding it with a
puzzled face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks
the younger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron
correspondence of the day. This done, Mr. George takes a hearty
farewell of the family party and prepares to saddle and mount. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
brother, however, unwilling to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so soon, proposes to
ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in a light open carriage to the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will
bait for the night, and there remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) until morning, a
servant riding for so much of the journey on the thoroughbred old
grey from Chesney Wold. The offer, being gladly accepted, is followed
by a pleasant ride, a pleasant dinner, and a pleasant breakfast, all
in brotherly communion. Then they once more shake hands long and
heartily and part, the ironmaster turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) face to the smoke and
fires, and the trooper to the green country. Early in the afternoon
the subdued sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) heavy military trot is heard on the turf in
the avenue as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of
accoutrements under the old elm-trees.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIV

<p/>Esther's Narrative


<p/>Soon after I had that conversation with my guardian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) put a sealed
paper in my hand one morning and said, <div class="bookquote">``This is for next month, my
dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I found in it two hundred pounds.

<p/>I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were
necessary. Regulating my purchases by my guardian's taste, which I
knew very well of course, I arranged my wardrobe to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) and
hoped I should be highly successful. I did it all so quietly because
I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be
rather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself. I had no
doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the
most private and simple manner. Perhaps I should only have to say to
Ada, <div class="bookquote">``Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow, my pet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ada</b></font>)</div>Perhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) own, and I
might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was
over. I thought that if I were to choose, I would like this best.

<p/>The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) that I was
going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some
time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) highly approved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) could never do enough for me and was
remarkably softened now in comparison with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had been when we
first knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>). There was no trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) would not have taken to have
been of use to me, but I need hardly say that I only allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) to
take as little as gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) kindness without tasking it.

<p/>Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian, and of course
it was not a time for neglecting my darling. So I had plenty of
occupation, which I was glad of; and as to Charley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was
absolutely not to be seen for needlework. To surround herself with
great heaps of it--baskets full and tables full--and do a little, and
spend a great deal of time in staring with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) round eyes at what
there was to do, and persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was going to do it,
were Charley's great dignities and delights.

<p/>Meanwhile, I must say, I could not agree with my guardian on the
subject of the will, and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and
Jarndyce. Which of us was right will soon appear, but I certainly did
encourage expectations. In Richard, the discovery gave occasion for a
burst of business and agitation that buoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) up for a little time,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to
retain only its feverish anxieties. From something my guardian said
one day when we were talking about this, I understood that my
marriage would not take place until after the term-time we had been
told to look forward to; and I thought the more, for that, how
rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were
a little more prosperous.

<p/>The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town
and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt's business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) had told
me beforehand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) presence there would be necessary. I had just
come in one night from my dear girl's and was sitting in the midst of
all my new clothes, looking at them all around me and thinking, when
a letter from my guardian was brought to me. It asked me to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
in the country and mentioned by what stage-coach my place was taken
and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town. It added
in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada.

<p/>I expected few things less than a journey at that time, but I was
ready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next
morning. I travelled all day, wondering all day what I could be
wanted for at such a distance; now I thought it might be for this
purpose, and now I thought it might be for that purpose, but I was
never, never, never near the truth.

<p/>It was night when I came to my journey's end and found my guardian
waiting for me. This was a great relief, for towards evening I had
begun to fear -LRB-the more so as his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) letter was a very short one-RRB- that
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might be ill. However, there he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was, as well as it was possible to
be; and when I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) genial face again at its brightest and best, I
said to myself, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has been doing some other great kindness. Not that
it required much penetration to say that, because I knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
being there at all was an act of kindness.

<p/>Supper was ready at the hotel, and when we were alone at table he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Full of curiosity, no doubt, little woman, to know why I have
brought you here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``without thinking myself a Fatima or you a
Blue Beard, I am a little curious about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then to ensure your night's rest, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) returned gaily, <div class="bookquote">``I
won't wait until to-morrow to tell you. I have very much wished to
express to Woodcourt, somehow, my sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) humanity to poor
unfortunate Jo, his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) inestimable services to my young cousins, and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
value to us all. When it was decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) should settle here, it
came into my head that I might ask his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) acceptance of some
unpretending and suitable little place to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own head in. I
therefore caused such a place to be looked out for, and such a place
was found on very easy terms, and I have been touching it up for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
and making it habitable. However, when I walked over it the day
before yesterday and it was reported ready, I found that I was not
housekeeper enough to know whether things were all as they ought to
be. So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly
be got to come and give me her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) advice and opinion. And here she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``laughing and crying both together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was so dear, so good, so admirable. I tried to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
what I thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), but I could not articulate a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``You make too much of it, little woman.
Why, how you sob, Dame Durden, how you sob!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is with exquisite pleasure, guardian--with a heart full of
thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am delighted that you approve. I thought
you would. I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress
of Bleak House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and dried my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I know now!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen
this in your face a long while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; have you really, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What a Dame Durden it is to
read a face!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise, and
was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all. When I went to
bed, I cried. I am bound to confess that I cried; but I hope it was
with pleasure, though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure. I
repeated every word of the letter twice over.

<p/>A most beautiful summer morning succeeded, and after breakfast we
went out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty
housekeeping opinion. We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side
wall, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had the key, and the first thing I saw was that the
beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds
and flowers at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian, standing still with a
delighted face to watch my looks, <div class="bookquote">``knowing there could be no better
plan, I borrowed yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>We went on by a pretty little orchard, where the cherries were
nestling among the green leaves and the shadows of the apple-trees
were sporting on the grass, to the house itself--a cottage, quite a
rustic cottage of doll's rooms; but such a lovely place, so tranquil
and so beautiful, with such a rich and smiling country spread around
it; with water sparkling away into the distance, here all overhung
with summer-growth, there turning a humming mill; at its nearest
point glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town, where
cricket-players were assembling in bright groups and a flag was
flying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind. And
still, as we went through the pretty rooms, out at the little rustic
verandah doors, and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades garlanded
with woodbine, jasmine, and honey-suckle, I saw in the papering on
the walls, in the colours of the furniture, in the arrangement of all
the pretty objects, MY little tastes and fancies, MY little methods
and inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them,
my odd ways everywhere.

<p/>I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful,
but one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this, I thought, oh,
would he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) be the happier for it! Would it not have been better for his (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)
peace that I should not have been so brought before him (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)? Because
although I was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) thought me, still he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) loved me very dearly,
and it might remind him (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) mournfully of what be believed he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) had lost. I
did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) to forget me--perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) might not have done so,
without these aids to his (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) memory--but my way was easier than his (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), and
I could have reconciled myself even to that so that he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) had been the
happier for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, whom I had never seen so
proud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my
appreciation of them, <div class="bookquote">``now, last of all, for the name of this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it called, dear guardian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``come and see,''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) took me to the porch, which he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) had hitherto avoided, and said,
pausing before we went out, <div class="bookquote">``My dear child, don't you guess the
name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>We went out of the porch and he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) showed me written over it, Bleak
House.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) led me to a seat among the leaves close by, and sitting down
beside me and taking my hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), spoke to me thus, <div class="bookquote">``My darling
girl, in what there has been between us, I have, I hope, been really
solicitous for your happiness. When I wrote you the letter to which
you brought the answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) referred to it, <div class="bookquote">``I had my own
too much in view; but I had yours too. Whether, under different
circumstances, I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes
dreamed when you were very young, of making you my wife one day, I
need not ask myself. I did renew it, and I wrote my letter, and you
brought your answer. You are following what I say, my child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I was cold, and I trembled violently, but not a word he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) uttered was
lost. As I sat looking fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) and the sun's rays descended,
softly shining through the leaves upon his (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) bare head, I felt as if
the brightness on him (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) must be like the brightness of the angels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear me, my love, but do not speak. It is for me to speak now. When
it was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really
make you happy is no matter. Woodcourt came home, and I soon had no
doubt at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) round the neck and hung my head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) breast and
wept. <div class="bookquote">``Lie lightly, confidently here, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), pressing me
gently to him (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am your guardian and your father now. Rest
confidently here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Soothingly, like the gentle rustling of the leaves; and genially,
like the ripening weather; and radiantly and beneficently, like the
sunshine, he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Understand me, my dear girl. I had no doubt of your being contented
and happy with me, being so dutiful and so devoted; but I saw with
whom you would be happier. That I penetrated his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) secret when Dame
Durden was blind to it is no wonder, for I knew the good that could
never change in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) better far than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did. Well! I have long been
in Allan Woodcourt's confidence, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was not, until
yesterday, a few hours before you came here, in mine. But I would not
have my Esther's bright example lost; I would not have a jot of my
dear girl's virtues unobserved and unhonoured; I would not have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
admitted on sufferance into the line of Morgan ap-Kerrig, no, not for
the weight in gold of all the mountains in Wales!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) stopped to kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh.
For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, little woman! Don't cry; this is to be a day of joy. I have
looked forward to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) said exultingly, ``for months on months! A
few words more, Dame Trot, and I have said my say. Determined not to
throw away one atom of my Esther's worth, I took Mrs. Woodcourt into
a separate confidence. ``Now, madam,'' said I, ``I clearly perceive--and
indeed I know, to boot--that your son loves my ward. I am further
very sure that my ward loves your son, but will sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) love to
a sense of duty and affection, and will sacrifice it so completely,
so entirely, so religiously, that you should never suspect it though
you watched her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) night and day.'' Then I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) all our
story--ours--yours and mine. ``Now, madam,<div class="bookquote">'' said I, `come you, knowing
this, and live with us. Come you, and see my child from hour to hour;
set what you see against her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pedigree, which is this, and this'--for
I scorned to mince it--`and tell me what is the true legitimacy when
you shall have quite made up your mind on that subject.''  (<font color='red'><b>madam</b></font>)</div>Why, honour
to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) old Welsh blood, my dear,'' cried my guardian with enthusiasm,
<div class="bookquote">``I believe the heart it animates beats no less warmly, no less
admiringly, no less lovingly, towards Dame Durden than my own!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Welsh</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) tenderly raised my head, and as I clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>), kissed me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>)
old fatherly way again and again. What a light, now, on the
protecting manner I had thought about!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One more last word. When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you, my dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>)
spoke with my knowledge and consent--but I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) no encouragement,
not I, for these surprises were my great reward, and I was too
miserly to part with a scrap of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) was to come and tell me all
that passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) did. I have no more to say. My dearest, Allan
Woodcourt stood beside your father when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) lay dead--stood beside
your mother. This is Bleak House. This day I give this house its
little mistress; and before God, it is the brightest day in all my
life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) rose and raised me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>). We were no longer alone. My
husband--I have called him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by that name full seven happy years
now--stood at my side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allan,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``take from me a willing gift, the best
wife that ever man had. What more can I say for you than that I know
you deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! Take with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the little home she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brings you. You
know what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will make it, Allan; you know what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has made its
namesake. Let me share its felicity sometimes, and what do I
sacrifice? Nothing, nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kissed me once again, and now the tears were in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
said more softly, <div class="bookquote">``Esther, my dearest, after so many years, there is
a kind of parting in this too. I know that my mistake has caused you
some distress. Forgive your old guardian, in restoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) old
place in your affections; and blot it out of your memory. Allan, take
my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) moved away from under the green roof of leaves, and stopping in
the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us, said, <div class="bookquote">``I
shall be found about here somewhere. It's a west wind, little woman,
due west! Let no one thank me any more, for I am going to revert to
my bachelor habits, and if anybody disregards this warning, I'll run
away and never come back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>What happiness was ours that day, what joy, what rest, what hope,
what gratitude, what bliss! We were to be married before the month
was out, but when we were to come and take possession of our own
house was to depend on Richard and Ada.

<p/>We all three went home together next day. As soon as we arrived in
town, Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) and my darling. Late as it was, I meant to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) for a few
minutes before lying down to sleep, but I went home with my guardian
first to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) tea for him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) and to occupy the old chair by his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
side, for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon.

<p/>When we came home we found that a young man had called three times in
the course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the
occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) third call that I was not expected to return before
ten o'clock at night, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left word that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would call about then.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) card three times. Mr. Guppy.

<p/>As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits, and as I
always associated something ludicrous with the visitor, it fell out
that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) old
proposal and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) subsequent retraction. <div class="bookquote">``After that,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my
guardian, <div class="bookquote">``we will certainly receive this hero.''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>So instructions were
given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) came again, and they
were scarcely given when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) did come again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) was embarrassed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) found my guardian with me, but recovered
himself and said, <div class="bookquote">``How de do, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir, I am tolerable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Will you allow
me to introduce my mother, Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road, and my
particular friend, Mr. Weevle. That is to say, my friend has gone by
the name of Weevle, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Weevle</b></font>) name is really and truly Jobling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian begged them to be seated, and they all sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend after an awkward silence. <div class="bookquote">``Will
you open the case?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do it yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>returned the friend rather tartly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Jarndyce, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy, after a moment's consideration,
began, to the great diversion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mother, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) displayed by
nudging Mr. Jobling with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) elbow and winking at me in a most
remarkable manner, <div class="bookquote">``I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by
herself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence. But
Miss Summerson has mentioned to you, perhaps, that something has
passed between us on former occasions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``has made a
communication to that effect to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``makes matters easier. Sir, I have come out
of my articles at Kenge and Carboy's, and I believe with satisfaction
to all parties. I am now admitted -LRB-after undergoing an examination
that's enough to badger a man blue, touching a pack of nonsense that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't want to know-RRB- on the roll of attorneys and have taken out my
certificate, if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Guppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite willing--I
believe I use a legal phrase--to admit the certificate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) pocket
and proceeded without it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no capital myself, but my mother has a little property which
takes the form of an annuity'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>--here Mr. Guppy's mother rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
head as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never could sufficiently enjoy the observation, and
put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth, and again winked at me--<div class="bookquote">``and a few
pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never
be wanting, free of interest, which is an advantage, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Guppy feelingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly an advantage,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I HAVE some connexion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``and it lays in the
direction of Walcot Square, Lambeth. I have therefore taken a `ouse
in that locality, which, in the opinion of my friends, is a hollow
bargain -LRB-taxes ridiculous, and use of fixtures included in the rent-RRB-,
and intend setting up professionally for myself there forthwith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Guppy's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a six-roomer, exclusive of kitchens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``and in
the opinion of my friends, a commodious tenement. When I mention my
friends, I refer principally to my friend Jobling, who I believe has
known me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Guppy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) with a sentimental air, <div class="bookquote">``from
boyhood's hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend Jobling will render me his (<font color='blue'><b>Jobling</b></font>) assistance in the capacity of
clerk and will live in the `ouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``My mother will
likewise live in the `ouse when her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) present quarter in the Old Street
Road shall have ceased and expired; and consequently there will be no
want of society. My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by
taste, and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper
circles, fully backs me in the intentions I am now developing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jobling said <div class="bookquote">``Certainly''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jobling/Jobling</b></font>)</div>and withdrew a little from the elbow of
Mr Guppy's mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I have no occasion to mention to you, sir, you being in the
confidence of Miss Summerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">''-LRB-mother, I wish you'd
be so good as to keep still-RRB-, that Miss Summerson's image was
formerly imprinted on my `eart and that I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) a proposal of
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I have heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``over which I had no control, but
quite the contrary, weakened the impression of that image for a time.
At which time Miss Summerson's conduct was highly genteel; I may even
add, magnanimous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy, <div class="bookquote">``I have got into that state of mind
myself that I wish for a reciprocity of magnanimous behaviour. I wish
to prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a heighth of which
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) hardly thought me capable. I find that the image which I
did suppose had been eradicated from my `eart is NOT eradicated. Its
influence over me is still tremenjous, and yielding to it, I am
willing to overlook the circumstances over which none of us have had
any control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I
had the honour to make at a former period. I beg to lay the `ouse in
Walcot Square, the business, and myself before Miss Summerson for her (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>)
acceptance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very magnanimous indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>observed my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Guppy with candour, <div class="bookquote">``my wish is to BE
magnanimous. I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss
Summerson I am by any means throwing myself away; neither is that the
opinion of my friends. Still, there are circumstances which I submit
may be taken into account as a set off against any little drawbacks
of mine, and so a fair and equitable balance arrived at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take upon myself, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, laughing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) rang the
bell, <div class="bookquote">``to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Summerson</b></font>) is
very sensible of your handsome intentions, and wishes you good
evening, and wishes you well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Guppy with a blank look. <div class="bookquote">``Is that tantamount, sir, to
acceptance, or rejection, or consideration?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To decided rejection, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian.

<p/>Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) mother, who
suddenly turned very angry, and at the floor, and at the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Then, Jobling, if you was the friend you
represent yourself, I should think you might hand my mother out of
the gangway instead of allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ain't
wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Guppy</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>)
wouldn't hear of it. <div class="bookquote">``Why, get along with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) to my
guardian, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean? Ain't my son good enough for you? You
ought to be ashamed of yourself. Get out with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``it is hardly reasonable to ask
me to get out of my own room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Get out with you. If we
ain't good enough for you, go and procure somebody that is good
enough. Go along and find 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy's
power of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest
offence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along and find somebody that's good enough for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Guppy</b></font>)</div>repeated
Mrs. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``Get out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Guppy/Guppy/William Guppy</b></font>)</div>Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy's mother
so much and to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so very indignant as our not getting out.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you get out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Guppy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Guppy. <div class="bookquote">``What are you stopping here
for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>interposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) son, always getting before her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) and pushing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) back with one shoulder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) sidled at my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``WILL you
hold your tongue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, William,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I won't! Not unless he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) gets out, I
won't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>However, Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy's
mother -LRB-who began to be quite abusive-RRB- and took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), very much
against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will, downstairs, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice rising a stair higher every
time her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) figure got a stair lower, and insisting that we should
immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us, and
above all things that we should get out.




<p/>CHAPTER LXV

<p/>Beginning the World


<p/>The term had commenced, and my guardian found an intimation from Mr.
Kenge that the cause would come on in two days. As I had sufficient
hopes of the will to be in a flutter about it, Allan and I agreed to
go down to the court that morning. Richard was extremely agitated and
was so weak and low, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) illness was still of the mind, that
my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked
forward--a very little way now--to the help that was to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
and never drooped.

<p/>It was at Westminster that the cause was to come on. It had come on
there, I dare say, a hundred times before, but I could not divest
myself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now. We left home
directly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and
walked down there through the lively streets--so happily and
strangely it seemed!--together.

<p/>As we were going along, planning what we should do for Richard and
Ada, I heard somebody calling <div class="bookquote">``Esther! My dear Esther! Esther!''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>And
there was Caddy Jellyby, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) head out of the window of a little
carriage which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hired now to go about in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) pupils -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had so
many-RRB-, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards' distance. I
had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) a note to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) of all that my guardian had done,
but had not had a moment to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>). Of course we turned back,
and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture, and was so
overjoyed to talk about the night when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brought me the flowers,
and was so determined to squeeze my face -LRB-bonnet and all-RRB- between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hands, and go on in a wild manner altogether, calling me all kinds of
precious names, and telling Allan I had done I don't know what for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down by letting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) say and do exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked. Allan,
standing at the window, was as pleased as Caddy; and I was as pleased
as either of them; and I wonder that I got away as I did, rather than
that I came off laughing, and red, and anything but tidy, and looking
after Caddy, who looked after us out of the coach-window as long as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see us.

<p/>This made us some quarter of an hour late, and when we came to
Westminster Hall we found that the day's business was begun. Worse
than that, we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery
that it was full to the door, and we could neither see nor hear what
was passing within. It appeared to be something droll, for
occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of <div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It appeared to
be something interesting, for every one was pushing and striving to
get nearer. It appeared to be something that made the professional
gentlemen very merry, for there were several young counsellors in
wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd, and when one of them
told the others about it, they put their hands in their pockets, and
quite doubled themselves up with laughter, and went stamping about
the pavement of the Hall.

<p/>We asked a gentleman by us if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew what cause was on. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told us
Jarndyce and Jarndyce. We asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) knew what was doing in it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said really, no he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) did not, nobody ever did, but as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
could make out, it was over. Over for the day? we asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
said, over for good.

<p/>Over for good!

<p/>When we heard this unaccountable answer, we looked at one another
quite lost in amazement. Could it be possible that the will had set
things right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich?
It seemed too good to be true. Alas it was!

<p/>Our suspense was short, for a break-up soon took place in the crowd,
and the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot and
bringing a quantity of bad air with them. Still they were all
exceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a farce
or a juggler than from a court of justice. We stood aside, watching
for any countenance we knew, and presently great bundles of paper
began to be carried out--bundles in bags, bundles too large to be got
into any bags, immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes,
which the bearers staggered under, and threw down for the time being,
anyhow, on the Hall pavement, while they went back to bring out more.
Even these clerks were laughing. We glanced at the papers, and seeing
Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere, asked an official-looking person
who was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over.
Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) said, it was all up with it at last, and burst out laughing
too.

<p/>At this juncture we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an
affable dignity upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>), listening to Mr. Vholes, who was
deferential and carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) own bag. Mr. Vholes was the first to see
us. <div class="bookquote">``Here is Miss Summerson, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Woodcourt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed! Yes. Truly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) hat to me with
polished politeness. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do? Glad to see you. Mr. Jarndyce is
not here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) never came there, I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Kenge, <div class="bookquote">``it is as well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) is NOT here
to-day, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)--shall I say, in my good friend's absence, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)
indomitable singularity of opinion?--might have been strengthened,
perhaps; not reasonably, but might have been strengthened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray what has been done to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>asked Allan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge with excessive urbanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has been done to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has been done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Quite so. Yes. Why, not
much has been done; not much. We have been checked--brought up
suddenly, I would say--upon the--shall I term it threshold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this will considered a genuine document, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Allan. <div class="bookquote">``Will
you tell us that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly, if I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kenge; <div class="bookquote">``but we have not gone
into that, we have not gone into that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not gone into that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Vholes as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) low
inward voice were an echo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to reflect, Mr. Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Kenge, using his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
silver trowel persuasively and smoothingly, <div class="bookquote">``that this has been a
great cause, that this has been a protracted cause, that this has
been a complex cause. Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been termed, not
inaptly, a monument of Chancery practice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And patience has sat upon it a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Allan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Kenge with a certain
condescending laugh he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had. <div class="bookquote">``Very well! You are further to reflect,
Mr. Woodcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>becoming dignified almost to severity, <div class="bookquote">``that on the
numerous difficulties, contingencies, masterly fictions, and forms of
procedure in this great cause, there has been expended study,
ability, eloquence, knowledge, intellect, Mr. Woodcourt, high
intellect. For many years, the--a--I would say the flower of the bar,
and the--a--I would presume to add, the matured autumnal fruits of
the woolsack--have been lavished upon Jarndyce and Jarndyce. If the
public have the benefit, and if the country have the adornment, of
this great grasp, it must be paid for in money or money's worth,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Kenge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Allan, appearing enlightened all in a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, our time presses. Do I understand that the whole estate
is found to have been absorbed in costs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hem! I believe so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vholes, what do YOU
say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that thus the suit lapses and melts away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kenge</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Kenge. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vholes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>whispered Allan, <div class="bookquote">``this will break Richard's
heart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>There was such a shock of apprehension in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) knew
Richard so perfectly, and I too had seen so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) gradual
decay, that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
foreboding love sounded like a knell in my ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In case you should be wanting Mr. C., sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vholes, coming
after us, <div class="bookquote">``you'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in court. I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) there resting himself
a little. Good day, sir; good day, Miss Summerson.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vholes/Vholes</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) gave me
that slowly devouring look of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>), while twisting up the strings of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) bag before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vholes</b></font>) hastened with it after Mr. Kenge, the benignant
shadow of whose conversational presence he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) seemed afraid to leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>)
gave one gasp as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) had swallowed the last morsel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) client,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenge</b></font>) black buttoned-up unwholesome figure glided away to the low
door at the end of the Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Allan, <div class="bookquote">``leave to me, for a little while, the
charge you gave me. Go home with this intelligence and come to Ada's
by and by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/>I would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) take me to a coach, but entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) to go to
Richard without a moment's delay and leave me to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wished.
Hurrying home, I found my guardian and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gradually with what
news I had returned. <div class="bookquote">``Little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), quite unmoved for
himself, <div class="bookquote">``to have done with the suit on any terms is a greater
blessing than I had looked for. But my poor young cousins!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was
possible to do. In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to
Symond's Inn and left me at the door. I went upstairs. When my
darling heard my footsteps, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) came out into the small passage and
threw her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) arms round my neck, but she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) composed herself directly and
said that Richard had asked for me several times. Allan had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
sitting in the corner of the court, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) told me, like a stone figure.
On being roused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) had broken away and made as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) would have
spoken in a fierce voice to the judge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was stopped by his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) mouth
being full of blood, and Allan had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) home.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was lying on a sofa with his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) eyes closed when I went in. There
were restoratives on the table; the room was made as airy as
possible, and was darkened, and was very orderly and quiet. Allan
stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) gravely. His (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) face appeared to me to be
quite destitute of colour, and now that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) without his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) seeing
me, I fully saw, for the first time, how worn away he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
looked handsomer than I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) look for many a day.

<p/>I sat down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) side in silence. Opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) eyes by and by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)
said in a weak voice, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) old smile, <div class="bookquote">``Dame Durden, kiss me,
my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) low
state cheerful and looking forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was happier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) said, in our
intended marriage than he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) could find words to tell me. My husband had
been a guardian angel to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and Ada, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blessed us both and
wished us all the joy that life could yield us. I almost felt as if
my own heart would have broken when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) take my husband's hand
and hold it to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breast.

<p/>We spoke of the future as much as possible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said several times
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must be present at our marriage if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could stand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
feet. Ada would contrive to take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, surely,
dearest Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But as my darling answered him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thus hopefully, so
serene and beautiful, with the help that was to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) so
near--I knew--I knew!

<p/>It was not good for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to talk too much, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was silent, we
were silent too. Sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), I made a pretence of working for
my dear, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had always been used to joke about my being busy. Ada
leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pillow, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dozed
often, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) awoke without seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), said first of all,
<div class="bookquote">``Where is Woodcourt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian
standing in the little hall. <div class="bookquote">``Who is that, Dame Durden?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>Richard
asked me. The door was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had observed in my face
that some one was there.

<p/>I looked to Allan for advice, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) nodded <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>bent over
Richard and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). My guardian saw what passed, came softly by me
in a moment, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hand on Richard's. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard,
<div class="bookquote">``you are a good man, you are a good man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>and burst into tears for
the first time.

<p/>My guardian, the picture of a good man, sat down in my place, keeping
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on Richard's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Rick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the clouds have cleared away, and it is
bright now. We can see now. We were all bewildered, Rick, more or
less. What matters! And how are you, my dear boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very weak, sir, but I hope I shall be stronger. I have to begin
the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, truly; well said!''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>cried my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not begin it in the old way now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard with a sad
smile. <div class="bookquote">``I have learned a lesson now, sir. It was a hard one, but you
shall be assured, indeed, that I have learned it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, comforting him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``well, well, well,
dear boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>resumed Richard, <div class="bookquote">``that there is nothing on
earth I should so much like to see as their house--Dame Durden's and
Woodcourt's house. If I could be removed there when I begin to
recover my strength, I feel as if I should get well there sooner than
anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, so have I been thinking too, Rick,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian woman</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, <div class="bookquote">``and our
little woman likewise; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and I have been talking of it this very
day. I dare say her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband won't object. What do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Richard smiled and lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arm to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) stood behind
the head of the couch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing of Ada,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``but I think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>), and have
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) very much. Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)! See her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) here, sir, bending
over this pillow when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) has so much need to rest upon it herself,
my dear love, my poor girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arms, and none of us spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gradually
released her (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) looked upon us, and looked up to heaven, and
moved her (<font color='blue'><b>guardian</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I get down to Bleak House,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, <div class="bookquote">``I shall have much to
tell you, sir, and you will have much to show me. You will go, won't
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly, dear Rick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; like you, like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``But it's all like
you. They have been telling me how you planned it and how you
remembered all Esther's familiar tastes and ways. It will be like
coming to the old Bleak House again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will come there too, I hope, Rick. I am a solitary man now,
you know, and it will be a charity to come to me. A charity to come
to me, my love!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) repeated to Ada as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) gently passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hand over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) golden hair and put a lock of it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lips. -LRB-I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) vowed
within himself to cherish her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) were left alone.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a troubled dream?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard, clasping both my guardian's
hands eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing more, Rick; nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity
the dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) wakes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I can. What am I but another dreamer, Rick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will begin the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard with a light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada, and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) solemnly
lift up his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) hand to warn my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall I go from this place to that pleasant country where the
old times are, where I shall have strength to tell what Ada has been
to me, where I shall be able to recall my many faults and
blindnesses, where I shall prepare myself to be a guide to my unborn
child?''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Mr. Carstone/Mr. Richard</b></font>)</div>said Richard. <div class="bookquote">``When shall I go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Rick, when you are strong enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>returned my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ada, my darling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sought to raise himself a little. Allan raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
could hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bosom, which was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done you many wrongs, my own. I have fallen like a poor stray
shadow on your way, I have married you to poverty and trouble, I have
scattered your means to the winds. You will forgive me all this, my
Ada, before I begin the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A smile irradiated his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bent to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) slowly laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) face down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) bosom, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) arms closer round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) neck,
and with one parting sob began the world. Not this world, oh, not
this! The world that sets this right.

<p/>When all was still, at a late hour, poor crazed Miss Flite came
weeping to me and told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) birds their liberty.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVI

<p/>Down in Lincolnshire


<p/>There is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days, as there is
upon a portion of the family history. The story goes that Sir
Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace;
but it is a lame story, feebly whispering and creeping about, and any
brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away. It is known for
certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the
park, where the trees arch darkly overhead, and the owl is heard at
night making the woods ring; but whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was brought home to be
laid among the echoes of that solitary place, or how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) died, is all
mystery. Some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) old friends, principally to be found among the
peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats, did once
occasionally say, as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large
fans--like charmers reduced to flirting with grim death, after losing
all their other beaux--did once occasionally say, when the world
assembled together, that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks,
entombed in the mausoleum, never rose against the profanation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
company. But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have
never been known to object.

<p/>Up from among the fern in the hollow, and winding by the bridle-road
among the trees, comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of
horses' hoofs. Then may be seen Sir Leicester--invalided, bent, and
almost blind, but of worthy presence yet--riding with a stalwart man
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), constant to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bridle-rein. When they come to a certain
spot before the mausoleum-door, Sir Leicester's accustomed horse
stops of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own accord, and Sir Leicester, pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, is
still for a few moments before they ride away.

<p/>War rages yet with the audacious Boythorn, though at uncertain
intervals, and now hotly, and now coolly, flickering like an unsteady
fire. The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to
Lincolnshire for good, Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to
abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would, which
Sir Leicester, conceiving to be a condescension to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) illness or
misfortune, took in such high dudgeon, and was so magnificently
aggrieved by, that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of
committing a flagrant trespass to restore his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) neighbour to himself.
Similarly, Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the
disputed thoroughfare and -LRB-with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) bird upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) head-RRB- to hold forth
vehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) own home;
similarly, also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) defies him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) as of old in the little church by
testifying a bland unconsciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) existence. But it is
whispered that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is most ferocious towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) old foe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is
really most considerate, and that Sir Leicester, in the dignity of
being implacable, little supposes how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) is humoured. As little
does he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) think how near together he (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) antagonist have suffered
in the fortunes of two sisters, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) antagonist, who knows it now,
is not the man to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>). So the quarrel goes on to the
satisfaction of both.

<p/>In one of the lodges of the park--that lodge within sight of the
house where, once upon a time, when the waters were out down in
Lincolnshire, my Lady used to see the keeper's child--the stalwart
man, the trooper formerly, is housed. Some relics of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old calling
hang upon the walls, and these it is the chosen recreation of a
little lame man about the stable-yard to keep gleaming bright. A busy
little man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always is, in the polishing at harness-house doors, of
stirrup-irons, bits, curb-chains, harness bosses, anything in the way
of a stable-yard that will take a polish, leading a life of friction.
A shaggy little damaged man, withal, not unlike an old dog of some
mongrel breed, who has been considerably knocked about. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answers to
the name of Phil.

<p/>A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper -LRB-harder of
hearing now-RRB- going to church on the arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) son and to
observe--which few do, for the house is scant of company in these
times--the relations of both towards Sir Leicester, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) towards
them. They have visitors in the high summer weather, when a grey
cloak and umbrella, unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods, are
seen among the leaves; when two young ladies are occasionally found
gambolling in sequestered saw-pits and such nooks of the park; and
when the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening
air from the trooper's door. Then is a fife heard trolling within the
lodge on the inspiring topic of the <div class="bookquote">``British Grenadiers'' (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>; and as the
evening closes in, a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say, while
two men pace together up and down, <div class="bookquote">``But I never own to it before the
old girl. Discipline must be maintained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>The greater part of the house is shut up, and it is a show-house no
longer; yet Sir Leicester holds his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) shrunken state in the long
drawing-room for all that, and reposes in his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) old place before my
Lady's picture. Closed in by night with broad screens, and illumined
only in that part, the light of the drawing-room seems gradually
contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more. A little more,
in truth, and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester; and the
damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight, and looks so
obdurate, will have opened and received him (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>).

<p/>Volumnia, growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
face, and yellower as to the white, reads to Sir Leicester in the
long evenings and is driven to various artifices to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
yawns, of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of
the pearl necklace between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) rosy lips. Long-winded treatises on
the Buffy and Boodle question, showing how Buffy is immaculate and
Boodle villainous, and how the country is lost by being all Boodle
and no Buffy, or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle -LRB-it must be
one of the two, and cannot be anything else-RRB-, are the staple of her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>)
reading. Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not
appear to follow it very closely, further than that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) always comes
broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off, and sonorously
repeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) last words, begs with some displeasure to know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>)
finds herself fatigued. However, Volumnia, in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>)
bird-like hopping about and pecking at papers, has alighted on a
memorandum concerning herself in the event of <div class="bookquote">``anything happening''  (<font color='red'><b>kinsman compensation</b></font>)</div>to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Buffy</b></font>) kinsman, which is handsome compensation for an extensive course
of reading and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay.

<p/>The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dullness,
but take to it a little in the shooting season, when guns are heard
in the plantations, and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at
the old places of appointment for low-spirited twos and threes of
cousins. The debilitated cousin, more debilitated by the dreariness
of the place, gets into a fearful state of depression, groaning under
penitential sofa-pillows in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) gunless hours and protesting that
such fernal old jail's--nough t`sew fler up--frever.

<p/>The only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the
place in Lincolnshire are those occasions, rare and widely separated,
when something is to be done for the county or the country in the way
of gracing a public ball. Then, indeed, does the tuckered sylph come
out in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the
exhausted old assembly-room, fourteen heavy miles off, which, during
three hundred and sixty-four days and nights of every ordinary year,
is a kind of antipodean lumber-room full of old chairs and tables
upside down. Then, indeed, does she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) captivate all hearts by her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)
condescension, by her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) girlish vivacity, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) skipping about as
in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of
teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each. Then does she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)
twirl and twine, a pastoral nymph of good family, through the mazes
of the dance. Then do the swains appear with tea, with lemonade, with
sandwiches, with homage. Then is she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) kind and cruel, stately and
unassuming, various, beautifully wilful. Then is there a singular
kind of parallel between her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) and the little glass chandeliers of
another age embellishing that assembly-room, which, with their meagre
stems, their spare little drops, their disappointing knobs where no
drops are, their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have
both departed, and their little feeble prismatic twinkling, all seem
Volumnias.

<p/>For the rest, Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of
overgrown house looking out upon trees, sighing, wringing their
hands, bowing their heads, and casting their tears upon the
window-panes in monotonous depressions. A labyrinth of grandeur, less
the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly
likenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which
start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding
through the building. A waste of unused passages and staircases in
which to drop a comb upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a
stealthy footfall on an errand through the house. A place where few
people care to go about alone, where a maid screams if an ash drops
from the fire, takes to crying at all times and seasons, becomes the
victim of a low disorder of the spirits, and gives warning and
departs.

<p/>Thus Chesney Wold. With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and
vacancy; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry
lowering; so sombre and motionless always--no flag flying now by day,
no rows of lights sparkling by night; with no family to come and go,
no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms, no stir of
life about it--passion and pride, even to the stranger's eye, have
died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull
repose.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVII

<p/>The Close of Esther's Narrative


<p/>Full seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House. The
few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned;
then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever. Not
without much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) or hers.

<p/>They gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never
left her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). The little child who was to have done so much was born
before the turf was planted on its father's grave. It was a boy; and
I, my husband, and my guardian gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's name.

<p/>The help that my dear counted on did come to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), though it came, in
the eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, not his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, was the errand of this baby, its power
was mighty to do it. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand
and how its touch could heal my darling's heart and raised hope
within her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of
God.

<p/>They throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country
garden and walk there with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) infant in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms. I was married
then. I was the happiest of the happy.

<p/>It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
would come home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Both houses are your home, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but the older Bleak
House claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do
it, come and take possession of your home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ada called him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dearest cousin, John.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, no, it must
be guardian now. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had an old association with the name. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) guardian,
and has called him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) guardian ever since. The children know him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by no
other name. I say the children; I have two little daughters.

<p/>It is difficult to believe that Charley -LRB-round-eyed still, and not at
all grammatical-RRB- is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so
it is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write early in the
morning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go
round. I hope the miller will not spoil Charley; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) is very fond
of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), and Charley is rather vain of such a match, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) is well to
do and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I
might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill
did half an hour ago, since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly
what Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really
afraid to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) did at school in ciphering, but I think it was
decimals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) is apprenticed to the miller, whatever it was, and is a
good bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody and being
ashamed of it.

<p/>Caddy Jellyby passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) very last holidays with us and was a dearer
creature than ever, perpetually dancing in and out of the house with
the children as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) had never given a dancing-lesson in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) life.
Caddy keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and
lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) works
very hard, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) husband -LRB-an excellent one-RRB- being lame and able to do
very little. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) is more than contented and does all she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) has
to do with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) heart. Mr. Jellyby spends his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) evenings at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) new
house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) head against the wall as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) used to do in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) old one.
I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great
mortification from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits, but
I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) got over it in time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) has been disappointed in
Borrioboola-Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the
king of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody--who survived the
climate--for rum, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jellyby</b></font>) has taken up with the rights of women to
sit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more
correspondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor
little girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not such a mite now, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is deaf and dumb. I
believe there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts to
soften the affliction of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child.

<p/>As if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of
Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop. Peepy is in the Custom House, and doing
extremely well. Old Mr. Turveydrop, very apoplectic, still exhibits
his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) deportment about town, still enjoys himself in the old manner, is
still believed in in the old way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) is constant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) patronage of
Peepy and is understood to have bequeathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) a favourite French
clock in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) dressing-room--which is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) property.

<p/>With the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house
by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we
inaugurated with great splendour the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) came down to see
us. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in
drawing to an end, but when I write of him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>), my tears will have their
way.

<p/>I never look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Turveydrop</b></font>) but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) a
good man. To Ada and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) pretty boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is the fondest father; to me
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has ever been, and what name can I give to that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is
my husband's best and dearest friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is our children's darling,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is the object of our deepest love and veneration. Yet while I feel
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) were a superior being, I am so familiar with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
and so easy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) that I almost wonder at myself. I have never
lost my old names, nor has he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>); nor do I ever, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is
with us, sit in any other place than in my old chair at his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) side,
Dame Trot, Dame Durden, Little Woman--all just the same as ever; and
I answer, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear guardian!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>just the same.

<p/>I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment
since the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Durden</b></font>) took me to the porch to read the name. I
remarked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Durden</b></font>) once that the wind seemed never in the east now, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Durden</b></font>) said, no, truly; it had finally departed from that quarter on that
very day.

<p/>I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever. The sorrow that
has been in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face--for it is not there now--seems to have purified
even its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality.
Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the black dress that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel--it is difficult to
express--as if it were so good to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dear
Esther in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prayers.

<p/>I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) my Richard! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has two mamas, and I am
one.

<p/>We are not rich in the bank, but we have always prospered, and we
have quite enough. I never walk out with my husband but I hear the
people bless him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I never go into a house of any degree but I hear
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) praises or see them in grateful eyes. I never lie down at night
but I know that in the course of that day he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has alleviated pain and
soothed some fellow-creature in the time of need. I know that from
the beds of those who were past recovery, thanks have often, often
gone up, in the last hour, for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) patient ministration. Is not this
to be rich?

<p/>The people even praise me as the doctor's wife. The people even like
me as I go about, and make so much of me that I am quite abashed. I
owe it all to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), my love, my pride! They like me for his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sake, as I
do everything I do in life for his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sake.

<p/>A night or two ago, after bustling about preparing for my darling and
my guardian and little Richard, who are coming to-morrow, I was
sitting out in the porch of all places, that dearly memorable porch,
when Allan came home. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``My precious little woman, what are
you doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And I said, <div class="bookquote">``The moon is shining so brightly, Allan,
and the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here
thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been thinking about, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Allan then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How curious you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I am almost ashamed to tell you, but
I will. I have been thinking about my old looks--such as they were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said
Allan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you COULD
have loved me any better, even if I had retained them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Such as they were'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Allan, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as they were, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Dame Durden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div>said Allan, drawing my arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do
you ever look in the glass?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodcourt/Allan/Allan Woodcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I do; you see me do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know that; I am not certain that I know it now. But I know
that my dearest little pets are very pretty, and that my darling is
very beautiful, and that my husband is very handsome, and that my
guardian has the brightest and most benevolent face that ever was
seen, and that they can very well do without much beauty in me--even
supposing--.''

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
