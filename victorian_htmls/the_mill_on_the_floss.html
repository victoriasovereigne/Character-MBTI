<p/>Chapter I

<p/>Outside Dorlcote Mill


<p/>A wide plain, where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green
banks to the sea, and the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks its
passage with an impetuous embrace. On this mighty tide the black
ships--laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of
oil-bearing seed, or with the dark glitter of coal--are borne along to
the town of St. Ogg's, which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the
broad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the
river-brink, tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the
transient glance of this February sun. Far away on each hand stretch
the rich pastures, and the patches of dark earth made ready for the
seed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with the tint of
the tender-bladed autumn-sown corn. There is a remnant still of last
year's golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the
hedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees; the
distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their
red-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash. Just by
the red-roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current
into the Floss. How lovely the little river is, with its dark changing
wavelets! It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along
the bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of one
who is deaf and loving. I remember those large dipping willows. I
remember the stone bridge.

<p/>And this is Dorlcote Mill. I must stand a minute or two here on the
bridge and look at it, though the clouds are threatening, and it is
far on in the afternoon. Even in this leafless time of departing
February it is pleasant to look at,--perhaps the chill, damp season
adds a charm to the trimly kept, comfortable dwelling-house, as old as
the elms and chestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast. The
stream is brimful now, and lies high in this little withy plantation,
and half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house.
As I look at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate
bright-green powder softening the outline of the great trunks and
branches that gleam from under the bare purple boughs, I am in love
with moistness, and envy the white ducks that are dipping their heads
far into the water here among the withes, unmindful of the awkward
appearance they make in the drier world above.

<p/>The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy
deafness, which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene. They
are like a great curtain of sound, shutting one out from the world
beyond. And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming
home with sacks of grain. That honest wagoner is thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>)
dinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour; but he (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>) will
not touch it till he (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>) has fed his (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>) horses,--the strong, submissive,
meek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>) from
between their blinkers, that he (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>) should crack his (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>) whip at them in that
awful manner as if they needed that hint! See how they stretch their
shoulders up the slope toward the bridge, with all the more energy
because they are so near home. Look at their grand shaggy feet that
seem to grasp the firm earth, at the patient strength of their necks,
bowed under the heavy collar, at the mighty muscles of their
struggling haunches! I should like well to hear them neigh over their
hardly earned feed of corn, and see them, with their moist necks freed
from the harness, dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond.
Now they are on the bridge, and down they go again at a swifter pace,
and the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the
trees.

<p/>Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again, and watch the unresting
wheel sending out its diamond jets of water. That little girl is
watching it too; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been standing on just the same spot at the
edge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge. And that queer
white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in
ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is jealous because
his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement. It is
time the little playfellow went in, I think; and there is a very
bright fire to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): the red light shines out under the deepening
gray of the sky. It is time, too, for me to leave off resting my arms
on the cold stone of this bridge...

<p/>Ah, my arms are really benumbed. I have been pressing my elbows on the
arms of my chair, and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in
front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years
ago. Before I dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr. and Mrs.
Tulliver were talking about, as they sat by the bright fire in the
left-hand parlor, on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of.



<p/>Chapter II

<p/>Mr. Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) Resolution about Tom


<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I want, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver,--<div class="bookquote">``what I want is to give
Tom a good eddication; an eddication as'll be a bread to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). That was
what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to leave the academy
at Lady-day. I mean to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to a downright good school at
Midsummer. The two years at th' academy `ud ha' done well enough, if
I'd meant to make a miller and farmer of him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)'s had a fine
sight more schoolin' nor _I_ ever got. All the learnin' _my_ father
ever paid for was a bit o' birch at one end and the alphabet at th'
other. But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might
be up to the tricks o' these fellows as talk fine and write with a
flourish. It `ud be a help to me wi' these lawsuits, and arbitrations,
and things. I wouldn't make a downright lawyer o' the lad,--I should
be sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to be a raskill,--but a sort o' engineer, or a
surveyor, or an auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or one o' them
smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay, only for a big
watch-chain and a high stool. They're pretty nigh all one, and they're
not far off being even wi' the law, _I_ believe; for Riley looks
Lawyer Wakem i' the face as hard as one cat looks another. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s_ none
frightened at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver was speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife, a blond comely woman in a
fan-shaped cap -LRB-I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped
caps were worn, they must be so near coming in again. At that time,
when Mrs. Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St. Ogg's, and
considered sweet things-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Tulliver, you know best: _I've_ no objections. But hadn't I
better kill a couple o' fowl, and have th' aunts and uncles to dinner
next week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have
got to say about it? There's a couple o' fowl _wants_ killing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may kill every fowl i' the yard if you like, Bessy; but I shall
ask neither aunt nor uncle what I'm to do wi' my own lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Tulliver, defiantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric,
<div class="bookquote">``how can you talk so, Mr. Tulliver? But it's your way to speak
disrespectful o' my family; and sister Glegg throws all the blame
upo' me, though I'm sure I'm as innocent as the babe unborn. For
nobody's ever heard me say as it wasn't lucky for my children to have
aunts and uncles as can live independent. Howiver, if Tom's to go to a
new school, I should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to go where I can wash him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and mend him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>);
else he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might as well have calico as linen, for they'd be one as
yallow as th' other before they'd been washed half-a-dozen times. And
then, when the box is goin' back`ard and forrard, I could send the lad
a cake, or a pork-pie, or an apple; for he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) can do with an extry bit,
bless him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)! whether they stint him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) at the meals or no. My children can
eat as much victuals as most, thank God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, we won't send him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) out o' reach o' the carrier's cart, if
other things fit in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``But you mustn't put a spoke
i' the wheel about the washin,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>if we can't get a school near enough.
That's the fault I have to find wi' you, Bessy; if you see a stick i'
the road, you're allays thinkin' you can't step over it. You'd want me
not to hire a good wagoner, 'cause he (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>)'d got a mole on his (<font color='blue'><b>wagoner</b></font>) face.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, in mild surprise, <div class="bookquote">``when did I iver
make objections to a man because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d got a mole on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face? I'm sure
I'm rether fond o' the moles; for my brother, as is dead an' gone, had
a mole on his (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) brow. But I can't remember your iver offering to hire a
wagoner with a mole, Mr. Tulliver. There was John Gibbs hadn't a mole
on his (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) face no more nor you have, an' I was all for having you hire
_him (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>)_; an' so you did hire him (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>), an' if he (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) hadn't died o' th'
inflammation, as we paid Dr. Turnbull for attending him (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>)'d very
like ha' been drivin' the wagon now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) might have a mole somewhere
out o' sight, but how was I to know that, Mr. Tulliver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Bessy; I didn't mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for
summat else; but niver mind--it's puzzling work, talking is. What I'm
thinking on, is how to find the right sort o' school to send Tom to,
for I might be ta'en in again, as I've been wi' th' academy. I'll have
nothing to do wi' a `cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it
sha'n't be a `cademy; it shall be a place where the lads spend their
time i' summat else besides blacking the family's shoes, and getting
up the potatoes. It's an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school
to pick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) breeches pockets as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) hoped to find some suggestion there.
Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not disappointed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) presently said, <div class="bookquote">``I know
what I'll do: I'll talk it over wi' Riley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)'s coming to-morrow, t'
arbitrate about the dam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Tulliver, I've put the sheets out for the best bed, and
Kezia's got 'em hanging at the fire. They aren't the best sheets, but
they're good enough for anybody to sleep in, be he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) will; for as
for them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying 'em, only they'll
do to lay us out in. An' if you was to die to-morrow, Mr. Tulliver,
they're mangled beautiful, an' all ready, an' smell o' lavender as it
`ud be a pleasure to lay 'em out; an' they lie at the left-hand corner
o' the big oak linen-chest at the back: not as I should trust anybody
to look 'em out but myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mrs. Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) drew a bright bunch of
keys from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pocket, and singled out one, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) thumb and
finger up and down it with a placid smile while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked at the
clear fire. If Mr. Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) conjugal
relation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) might have supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) drew out the key to aid her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
imagination in anticipating the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would be in a state to
justify the production of the best Holland sheets. Happily he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not
so; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was only susceptible in respect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) right to water-power;
moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had the marital habit of not listening very closely, and
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mention of Mr. Riley, had been apparently occupied in a
tactile examination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) woollen stockings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've hit it, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) first remark after a short
silence. <div class="bookquote">``Riley's as likely a man as any to know o' some school; he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)'s
had schooling himself, an' goes about to all sorts o' places,
arbitratin' and vallyin' and that. And we shall have time to talk it
over to-morrow night when the business is done. I want Tom to be such
a sort o' man as Riley, you know,--as can talk pretty nigh as well as
if it was all wrote out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>), and knows a good lot o' words as
don't mean much, so as you can't lay hold of 'em i' law; and a good
solid knowledge o' business too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``so far as talking proper, and knowing
everything, and walking with a bend in his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) back, and setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) hair
up, I shouldn't mind the lad being brought up to that. But them
fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false
shirt-fronts; they wear a frill till it's all a mess, and then hide it
with a bib; I know Riley does. And then, if Tom's to go and live at
Mudport, like Riley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)'ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big
enough to turn in, an' niver get a fresh egg for his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) breakfast, an'
sleep up three pair o' stairs,--or four, for what I know,--and be
burnt to death before he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) can get down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``I've no thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) going to
Mudport: I mean him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) to set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) office at St. Ogg's, close by us,
an' live at home. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Tulliver after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``what
I'm a bit afraid on is, as Tom hasn't got the right sort o' brains for
a smart fellow. I doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a bit slowish. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) takes after your
family, Bessy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, accepting the last
proposition entirely on its own merits; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s wonderful for liking a
deal o' salt in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) broth. That was my brother's way, and my father's
before him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems a bit a pity, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``as the lad should
take after the mother's side instead o' the little wench. That's the
worst on't wi' crossing o' breeds: you can never justly calkilate
what'll come on't. The little un takes after my side, now: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s twice
as `cute as Tom. Too `cute for a woman, I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>continued Mr.
Tulliver, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head dubiously first on one side and then on the
other. <div class="bookquote">``It's no mischief much while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a little un; but an
over-`cute woman's no better nor a long-tailed sheep,--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll fetch
none the bigger price for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it _is_ a mischief while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a little un, Mr. Tulliver, for it
runs to naughtiness. How to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a clean pinafore two hours
together passes my cunning. An' now you put me i' mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>continued
Mrs. Tulliver, rising and going to the window, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is now, an' it's pretty nigh tea-time. Ah, I thought so,--wanderin' up
an' down by the water, like a wild thing: She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll tumble in some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
head,--a process which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) repeated more than once before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) returned
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk o' `cuteness, Mr. Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) observed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sat down,
<div class="bookquote">``but I'm sure the child's half an idiot i' some things; for if I send
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) upstairs to fetch anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forgets what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s gone for, an'
perhaps `ull sit down on the floor i' the sunshine an' plait her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair
an' sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur', all the while I'm waiting
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) downstairs. That niver run i' my family, thank God! no more
nor a brown skin as makes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look like a mulatter. I don't like to
fly i' the face o' Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but
one gell, an' her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so comical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a straight, black-eyed
wench as anybody need wish to see. I don't know i' what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s behind

parson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair won't curl all I can do with it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s so franzy
about having it put i' paper, and I've such work as never was to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stand and have it pinched with th' irons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cut it off--cut it off short,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, rashly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you talk so, Mr. Tulliver? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s too big a gell--gone nine,

cousin Lucy's got a row o' curls round her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head, an' not a hair out o'
place. It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child;
I'm sure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does. Maggie,
Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>continued the mother, in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness,
as this small mistake of nature entered the room, <div class="bookquote">``where's the use o'
my telling you to keep away from the water? You'll tumble in and be
drownded some day, an' then you'll be sorry you didn't do as mother
told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's hair, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) threw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet, painfully confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mother's accusation. Mrs. Tulliver, desiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) daughter to have a
curled crop, <div class="bookquote">``like other folks's children,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>had had it cut too short
in front to be pushed behind the ears; and as it was usually straight
an hour after it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly
tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head to keep the dark, heavy locks out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gleaming
black eyes,--an action which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) very much the air of a small
Shetland pony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, oh, dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin' of, to throw your
bonnet down there? Take it upstairs, there's a good gell, an' let your

little lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, <div class="bookquote">``I don't _want_

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt
Glegg?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's foolish work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mane,--<div class="bookquote">``tearing
things to pieces to sew 'em together again. And I don't want to do
anything for my aunt Glegg. I don't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Exit Maggie, dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet by the string, while Mr. Tulliver
laughs audibly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder at you, as you'll laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), Mr. Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the
mother, with feeble fretfulness in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``You encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) i'
naughtiness. An' her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) aunts will have it as it's me spoils her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person,--never cried,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was a baby, on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and
from the cradle upward had been healthy, fair, plump, and dull-witted;
in short, the flower of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) family for beauty and amiability. But milk
and mildness are not the best things for keeping, and when they turn
only a little sour, they may disagree with young stomachs seriously. I
have often wondered whether those early Madonnas of Raphael, with the
blond faces and somewhat stupid expression, kept their placidity
undisturbed when their strong-limbed, strong-willed boys got a little
too old to do without clothing. I think they must have been given to
feeble remonstrance, getting more and more peevish as it became more
and more ineffectual.



<p/>Chapter III

<p/>Mr. Riley Gives His (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) Advice Concerning a School for Tom


<p/>The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)
brandy-and-water so pleasantly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) good friend Tulliver, is Mr.
Riley, a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands, rather
highly educated for an auctioneer and appraiser, but large-hearted
enough to show a great deal of _bonhomie_ toward simple country
acquaintances of hospitable habits. Mr. Riley spoke of such
acquaintances kindly as <div class="bookquote">``people of the old school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>acquaintances</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation had come to a pause. Mr. Tulliver, not without a
particular reason, had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool
retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix, and how
Wakem had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) comb cut for once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) life, now the business of
the dam had been settled by arbitration, and how there never would
have been any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody
was what they should be, and Old Harry hadn't made the lawyers.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver was, on the whole, a man of safe traditional opinions;
but on one or two points he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had trusted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) unassisted intellect,
and had arrived at several questionable conclusions; amongst the rest,
that rats, weevils, and lawyers were created by Old Harry. Unhappily
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no one to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that this was rampant Manichæism, else he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
might have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) error. But to-day it was clear that the good
principle was triumphant: this affair of the water-power had been a
tangled business somehow, for all it seemed--look at it one way--as
plain as water's water; but, big a puzzle as it was, it hadn't got the
better of Riley. Mr. Tulliver took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) brandy-and-water a little
stronger than usual, and, for a man who might be supposed to have a
few hundreds lying idle at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) banker's, was rather incautiously open
in expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) high estimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) friend's business talents.

<p/>But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could
always be taken up again at the same point, and exactly in the same
condition; and there was another subject, as you know, on which Mr.
Tulliver was in pressing want of Mr. Riley's advice. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
particular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
last draught, and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knees in a meditative manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not
a man to make an abrupt transition. This was a puzzling world, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
often said, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light on
an awkward corner. Mr. Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient. Why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) be? Even Hotspur, one would think, must have been patient in his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)
slippers on a warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping
gratuitous brandy-and-water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a thing I've got i' my head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver at last, in
rather a lower tone than usual, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head and looked
steadfastly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley, in a tone of mild interest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) was a man with
heavy waxen eyelids and high-arched eyebrows, looking exactly the same
under all circumstances. This immovability of face, and the habit of
taking a pinch of snuff before he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) gave an answer, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) trebly
oracular to Mr. Tulliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very particular thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``it's about my boy Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At the sound of this name, Maggie, who was seated on a low stool close
by the fire, with a large book open on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lap, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heavy hair
back and looked up eagerly. There were few sounds that roused Maggie
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was dreaming over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) book, but Tom's name served as well as
the shrillest whistle; in an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was on the watch, with
gleaming eyes, like a Skye terrier suspecting mischief, or at all
events determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I want to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to a new school at Midsummer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s comin' away from the `cademy at Lady-day, an' I shall
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) run loose for a quarter; but after that I want to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to
a downright good school, where they'll make a scholard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley, <div class="bookquote">``there's no greater advantage you can give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
than a good education. Not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) added, with polite significance,--<div class="bookquote">``not
that a man can't be an excellent miller and farmer, and a shrewd,
sensible fellow into the bargain, without much help from the
schoolmaster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, winking, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head on
one side; <div class="bookquote">``but that's where it is. I don't _mean_ Tom to be a miller
and farmer. I see no fun i' that. Why, if I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a miller an'
farmer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d be expectin' to take to the mill an' the land, an'
a-hinting at me as it was time for me to lay by an' think o' my latter
end. Nay, nay, I've seen enough o' that wi' sons. I'll never pull my
coat off before I go to bed. I shall give Tom an eddication an' put
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to a business, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) may make a nest for himself, an' not want to
push me out o' mine. Pretty well if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gets it when I'm dead an' gone.
I sha'n't be put off wi' spoon-meat afore I've lost my teeth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>This was evidently a point on which Mr. Tulliver felt strongly; and
the impetus which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
speech showed itself still unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a
defiant motion of the head from side to side, and an occasional <div class="bookquote">``Nay,
nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>like a subsiding growl.

<p/>These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
the quick. Tom, it appeared, was supposed capable of turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father out of doors, and of making the future in some way tragic by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wickedness. This was not to be borne; and Maggie jumped up from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stool, forgetting all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heavy book, which fell with a bang
within the fender, and going up between her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's knees, said, in a
half-crying, half-indignant voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, Tom wouldn't be naughty to you ever; I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper-dish,
and Mr. Tulliver's heart was touched; so Maggie was not scolded about
the book. Mr. Riley quietly picked it up and looked at it, while the
father laughed, with a certain tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hard-lined face, and
patted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little girl on the back, and then held her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands and kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) between his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! they mustn't say any harm o' Tom, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver,
looking at Maggie with a twinkling eye. Then, in a lower voice,
turning to Mr. Riley, as though Maggie couldn't hear, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) understands
what one's talking about so as never was. And you should hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
read,--straight off, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knowed it all beforehand. And allays at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) book! But it's bad--it's bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulliver added sadly, checking
this blamable exultation. <div class="bookquote">``A woman's no business wi' being so clever;
it'll turn to trouble, I doubt. But bless you!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--here the exultation
was clearly recovering the mastery,--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll read the books and
understand 'em better nor half the folks as are growed up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought
Mr. Riley would have a respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now; it had been evident that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) thought nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) before.

<p/>Mr. Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could make
nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) presently
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come and tell me something about this book; here are some
pictures,--I want to know what they mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, with deepening color, went without hesitation to Mr. Riley's
elbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and
tossing back her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mane, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll tell you what that means. It's a dreadful picture, isn't it?
But I can't help looking at it. That old woman in the water's a
witch,--they've put her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) in to find out whether she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'s a witch or no;
and if she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) swims she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'s a witch, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'s drowned--and killed, you
know--she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'s innocent, and not a witch, but only a poor silly old
woman. But what good would it do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then, you know, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
drowned? Only, I suppose, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d go to heaven, and God would make it up
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). And this dreadful blacksmith with his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) arms akimbo,
laughing,--oh, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) ugly?--I'll tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)'s the
Devil _really_''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here Maggie's voice became louder and more emphatic-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``and not a right blacksmith; for the Devil takes the shape of wicked
men, and walks about and sets people doing wicked things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>)'s
oftener in the shape of a bad man than any other, because, you know,
if people saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) was the Devil, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) roared at 'em, they'd run away,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) couldn't make 'em do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver had listened to this exposition of Maggie's with
petrifying wonder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what book is it the wench has got hold on?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) burst out at
last.

<p/>``The ``History of the Devil,<div class="bookquote">'' by Daniel Defoe,--not quite the right
book for a little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Devil</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley. <div class="bookquote">``How came it among your
books, Mr. Tulliver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked hurt and discouraged, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father said,--

<p/>``Why, it's one o' the books I bought at Partridge's sale. They was all
bound alike,--it's a good binding, you see,--and I thought they'd be
all good books. There's Jeremy Taylor's ``Holy Living and Dying' among
'em. I read in it often of a Sunday'' -LRB-Mr. Tulliver felt somehow a
familiarity with that great writer, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) name was Jeremy-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``and
there's a lot more of 'em,--sermons mostly, I think,--but they've all
got the same covers, and I thought they were all o' one sample, as you
may say. But it seems one mustn't judge by th' outside. This is a
puzzlin' world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley, in an admonitory, patronizing tone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)
patted Maggie on the head, ``I advise you to put by the ``History of the
Devil,<div class="bookquote">'' and read some prettier book. Have you no prettier books?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Devil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, reviving a little in the desire to vindicate
the variety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reading. <div class="bookquote">``I know the reading in this book isn't
pretty; but I like the pictures, and I make stories to the pictures
out of my own head, you know. But I've got 'Æsop's Fables,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kangaroos things</b></font>)</div>and a book
about Kangaroos and things, and the <div class="bookquote">``Pilgrim's Progress.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kangaroos things</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, a beautiful book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley; <div class="bookquote">``you can't read a better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but there's a great deal about the Devil in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll show you the picture of him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) true shape,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) fought with Christian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room, jumped on a chair,
and reached down from the small bookcase a shabby old copy of Bunyan,
which opened at once, without the least trouble of search, at the
picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, running back to Mr. Riley, <div class="bookquote">``and Tom colored
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paints when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was at home last holidays,--the
body all black, you know, and the eyes red, like fire, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s
all fire inside, and it shines out at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, peremptorily, beginning to feel rather
uncomfortable at these free remarks on the personal appearance of a
being powerful enough to create lawyers; <div class="bookquote">``shut up the book, and let's
hear no more o' such talk. It is as I thought--the child `ull learn
more mischief nor good wi' the books. Go, go and see after your
mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lawyers</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie shut up the book at once, with a sense of disgrace, but not
being inclined to see after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) compromised the matter by
going into a dark corner behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's chair, and nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
doll, toward which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom's
absence, neglecting its toilet, but lavishing so many warm kisses on
it that the waxen cheeks had a wasted, unhealthy appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever hear the like on't?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, as Maggie
retired. <div class="bookquote">``It's a pity but what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d been the lad,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d ha' been a
match for the lawyers, _she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)_ would. It's the wonderful`st thing'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) voice--<div class="bookquote">``as I picked the mother because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wasn't o'er
`cute--bein' a good-looking woman too, an' come of a rare family for
managing; but I picked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sisters o' purpose, 'cause she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
a bit weak like; for I wasn't agoin' to be told the rights o' things
by my own fireside. But you see when a man's got brains himself,
there's no knowing where they'll run to; an' a pleasant sort o' soft
woman may go on breeding you stupid lads and `cute wenches, till it's
like as if the world was turned topsy-turvy. It's an uncommon puzzlin'
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Riley's gravity gave way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) shook a little under the
application of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pinch of snuff before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But your lad's not stupid, is he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)? I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), when I was here last,
busy making fishing-tackle; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) seemed quite up to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) isn't not to say stupid,--he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s got a notion o' things out o'
door, an' a sort o' common sense, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d lay hold o' things by the
right handle. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s slow with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) tongue, you see, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) reads but
poorly, and can't abide the books, and spells all wrong, they tell me,
an' as shy as can be wi' strangers, an' you never hear him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) say `cute
things like the little wench. Now, what I want is to send him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to a
school where they'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a bit nimble with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) tongue and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
pen, and make a smart chap of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). I want my son to be even wi' these
fellows as have got the start o' me with having better schooling. Not
but what, if the world had been left as God made it, I could ha' seen
my way, and held my own wi' the best of 'em; but things have got so
twisted round and wrapped up i' unreasonable words, as aren't a bit
like 'em, as I'm clean at fault, often an' often. Everything winds
about so--the more straightforrad you are, the more you're puzzled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver took a draught, swallowed it slowly, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head
in a melancholy manner, conscious of exemplifying the truth that a
perfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this insane world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're quite in the right of it, Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Riley.
<div class="bookquote">``Better spend an extra hundred or two on your son's education, than
leave it him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in your will. I know I should have tried to do so by a
son of mine, if I'd had one, though, God knows, I haven't your ready
money to play with, Tulliver; and I have a houseful of daughters into
the bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, now, you know of a school as `ud be just the thing for
Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, not diverted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) purpose by any sympathy
with Mr. Riley's deficiency of ready cash.

<p/>Mr. Riley took a pinch of snuff, and kept Mr. Tulliver in suspense by
a silence that seemed deliberative, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know of a very fine chance for any one that's got the necessary
money and that's what you have, Tulliver. The fact is, I wouldn't
recommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular school, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
could afford to do better. But if any one wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) boy to get
superior instruction and training, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be the companion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) master, and that master a first rate fellow, I know his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) man. I
wouldn't mention the chance to everybody, because I don't think
everybody would succeed in getting it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were to try; but I
mention it to you, Tulliver, between ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The fixed inquiring glance with which Mr. Tulliver had been watching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) friend's oracular face became quite eager.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, now, let's hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, adjusting himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) chair with
the complacency of a person who is thought worthy of important
communications.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s an Oxford man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley, sententiously, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)
mouth close, and looking at Mr. Tulliver to observe the effect of this
stimulating information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! a parson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, rather doubtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and an M.A.. The bishop, I understand, thinks very highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>):
why, it was the bishop who got him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) present curacy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, to whom one thing was as wonderful as another
concerning these unfamiliar phenomena. <div class="bookquote">``But what can he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) want wi' Tom,
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the fact is, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'s fond of teaching, and wishes to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
studies, and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
parochial duties. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'s willing to take one or two boys as pupils to
fill up his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) time profitably. The boys would be quite of the
family,--the finest thing in the world for them; under Stelling's eye
continually.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you think they'd give the poor lad twice o' pudding?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Tulliver, who was now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) place again. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s such a boy for
pudding as never was; an' a growing boy like that,--it's dreadful to
think o' their stintin' him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what money `ud he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, whose instinct told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that the services of this admirable M.A. would bear a high price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
youngest pupils, and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)'s not to be mentioned with Stelling, the man I
speak of. I know, on good authority, that one of the chief people at
Oxford said, Stelling might get the highest honors if he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) chose. But he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
didn't care about university honors; he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)'s a quiet man--not noisy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, a deal better--a deal better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``but a hundred
and fifty's an uncommon price. I never thought o' paying so much as
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good education, let me tell you, Tulliver,--a good education is
cheap at the money. But Stelling is moderate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) terms; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s not a
grasping man. I've no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'d take your boy at a hundred, and
that's what you wouldn't get many other clergymen to do. I'll write to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) about it, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knees, and looked at the carpet in a
meditative manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But belike he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s a bachelor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Tulliver, in the interval;
<div class="bookquote">``an' I've no opinion o' housekeepers. There was my brother, as is dead
an' gone, had a housekeeper once, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) took half the feathers out
o' the best bed, an' packed 'em up an' sent 'em away. An' it's unknown
the linen she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) made away with--Stott her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) name was. It `ud break my
heart to send Tom where there's a housekeeper, an' I hope you won't
think of it, Mr. Tulliver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may set your mind at rest on that score, Mrs. Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Riley, <div class="bookquote">``for Stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man
need wish for a wife. There isn't a kinder little soul in the world; I
know her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) family well. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has very much your complexion,--light curly
hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) comes of a good Mudport family, and it's not every offer
that would have been acceptable in that quarter. But Stelling's not an
every-day man; rather a particular fellow as to the people he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chooses
to be connected with. But I _think_ he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have no objection to take
your son; I _think_ he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not, on my representation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have _against_ the lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver, with a slight touch of motherly indignation; <div class="bookquote">``a nice
fresh-skinned lad as anybody need wish to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's one thing I'm thinking on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, turning
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head on one side and looking at Mr. Riley, after a long perusal of
the carpet. <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't a parson be almost too high-learnt to bring up a
lad to be a man o' business? My notion o' the parsons was as they'd
got a sort o' learning as lay mostly out o' sight. And that isn't what
I want for Tom. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to know figures, and write like print, and
see into things quick, and know what folks mean, and how to wrap
things up in words as aren't actionable. It's an uncommon fine thing,
that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>concluded Mr. Tulliver, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``when you can let
a man know what you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without paying for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley, <div class="bookquote">``you're quite under a mistake
about the clergy; all the best schoolmasters are of the clergy. The
schoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very low set of men
generally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that Jacobs is, at the `cademy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Tulliver.

<p/>``To be sure,--men who have failed in other trades, most likely. Now, a
clergyman is a gentleman by profession and education; and besides
that, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) has the knowledge that will ground a boy, and prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) for
entering on any career with credit. There may be some clergymen who
are mere bookmen; but you may depend upon it, Stelling is not one of
them,--a man that's wide awake, let me tell you. Drop him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a hint, and
that's enough. You talk of figures, now; you have only to say to
Stelling, ``I want my son to be a thorough arithmetician,<div class="bookquote">'' and you may
leave the rest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Riley paused a moment, while Mr. Tulliver, some-what reassured as
to clerical tutorship, was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary Mr.
Stelling the statement, <div class="bookquote">``I want my son to know `rethmetic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, my dear Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Riley continued, <div class="bookquote">``when you get a
thoroughly educated man, like Stelling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s at no loss to take up any
branch of instruction. When a workman knows the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) tools, he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
can make a door as well as a window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, almost convinced now that the
clergy must be the best of schoolmasters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll tell you what I'll do for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley, <div class="bookquote">``and I
wouldn't do it for everybody. I'll see Stelling's father-in-law, or
drop him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) a line when I get back to Mudport, to say that you wish to
place your boy with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) son-in-law, and I dare say Stelling will write
to you, and send you his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's no hurry, is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``for I hope, Mr.
Tulliver, you won't let Tom begin at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) new school before Midsummer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) began at the `cademy at the Lady-day quarter, and you see what
good's come of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, Bessy, never brew wi' bad malt upo' Michael-masday, else
you'll have a poor tap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, winking and smiling at Mr.
Riley, with the natural pride of a man who has a buxom wife
conspicuously his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) inferior in intellect. <div class="bookquote">``But it's true there's no
hurry; you've hit it there, Bessy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Riley, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``for Stelling may have propositions from other
parties, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would not take more than two or three boarders,
if so many. If I were you, I think I would enter on the subject with
Stelling at once: there's no necessity for sending the boy before
Midsummer, but I would be on the safe side, and make sure that nobody
forestalls you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, there's summat in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>broke in Maggie, who had stolen unperceived to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's
elbow again, listening with parted lips, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doll
topsy-turvy, and crushed its nose against the wood of the
chair,--<div class="bookquote">``father, is it a long way off where Tom is to go? Sha'n't we
ever go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, my wench,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``Ask Mr. Riley;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie came round promptly in front of Mr. Riley, and said, <div class="bookquote">``How far
is it, please, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a long, long way off,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>that gentleman answered, being of opinion
that children, when they are not naughty, should always be spoken to
jocosely. <div class="bookquote">``You must borrow the seven-leagued boots to get to him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head haughtily, and
turning away, with the tears springing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to
dislike Mr. Riley; it was evident he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) silly and of no
consequence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Maggie! for shame of you, asking questions and chattering,''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Come and sit down on your little stool, and hold
your tongue, do. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Tulliver, who had her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own alarm
awakened, <div class="bookquote">``is it so far off as I couldn't wash him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) and mend him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About fifteen miles; that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Riley. <div class="bookquote">``You can drive
there and back in a day quite comfortably. Or--Stelling is a
hospitable, pleasant man--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d be glad to have you stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's too far off for the linen, I doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver,
sadly.

<p/>The entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty, and
relieved Mr. Riley from the labor of suggesting some solution or
compromise,--a labor which he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) would otherwise doubtless have
undertaken; for, as you perceive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) was a man of very obliging
manners. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) had really given himself the trouble of recommending
Mr. Stelling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) friend Tulliver without any positive expectation
of a solid, definite advantage resulting to himself, notwithstanding
the subtle indications to the contrary which might have misled a
too-sagacious observer. For there is nothing more widely misleading
than sagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent; and sagacity,
persuaded that men usually act and speak from distinct motives, with a
consciously proposed end in view, is certain to waste its energies on
imaginary game.

<p/>Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance, in order to compass
a selfish end, are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist:
they demand too intense a mental action for many of our
fellow-parishioners to be guilty of them. It is easy enough to spoil
the lives of our neighbors without taking so much trouble; we can do
it by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission, by trivial falsities for
which we hardly know a reason, by small frauds neutralized by small
extravagances, by maladroit flatteries, and clumsily improvised
insinuations. We live from hand to mouth, most of us, with a small
family of immediate desires; we do little else than snatch a morsel to
satisfy the hungry brood, rarely thinking of seed-corn or the next
year's crop.

<p/>Mr. Riley was a man of business, and not cold toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) own interest,
yet even he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) was more under the influence of small promptings than of
far-sighted designs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) had no private understanding with the Rev.
Walter Stelling; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) knew very little of that M.A. and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) acquirements,--not quite enough, perhaps, to warrant so strong a
recommendation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had given to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) friend Tulliver. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
believed Mr. Stelling to be an excellent classic, for Gadsby had said
so, and Gadsby's first cousin was an Oxford tutor; which was better
ground for the belief even than his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own immediate observation would
have been, for though Mr. Riley had received a tincture of the
classics at the great Mudport Free School, and had a sense of
understanding Latin generally, his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) comprehension of any particular
Latin was not ready. Doubtless there remained a subtle aroma from his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)
juvenile contact with the <div class="bookquote">``De Senectute''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the fourth book of the
<div class="bookquote">''Æneid,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but it had ceased to be distinctly recognizable as classical,
and was only perceived in the higher finish and force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>)
auctioneering style. Then, Stelling was an Oxford man, and the Oxford
men were always--no, no, it was the Cambridge men who were always good
mathematicians. But a man who had had a university education could
teach anything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked; especially a man like Stelling, who had made
a speech at a Mudport dinner on a political occasion, and had
acquitted himself so well that it was generally remarked, this
son-in-law of Timpson's was a sharp fellow. It was to be expected of a
Mudport man, from the parish of St. Ursula, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not omit to
do a good turn to a son-in-law of Timpson's, for Timpson was one of
the most useful and influential men in the parish, and had a good deal
of business, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew how to put into the right hands. Mr. Riley
liked such men, quite apart from any money which might be diverted,
through their good judgment, from less worthy pockets into his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) own;
and it would be a satisfaction to him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) to say to Timpson on his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) return
home, <div class="bookquote">``I've secured a good pupil for your son-in-law.''  (<font color='red'><b>Timpson</b></font>)</div>Timpson had a
large family of daughters; Mr. Riley felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>); besides, Louisa
Timpson's face, with its light curls, had been a familiar object to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) over the pew wainscot on a Sunday for nearly fifteen years; it was
natural her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) husband should be a commendable tutor. Moreover, Mr. Riley
knew of no other schoolmaster whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) had any ground for recommending
in preference; why, then, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) not recommend Stelling? His (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) friend
Tulliver had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) for an opinion; it is always chilling, in
friendly intercourse, to say you have no opinion to give. And if you
deliver an opinion at all, it is mere stupidity not to do it with an
air of conviction and well-founded knowledge. You make it your own in
uttering it, and naturally get fond of it. Thus Mr. Riley, knowing no
harm of Stelling to begin with, and wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) well, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) had
any wishes at all concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>), had no sooner recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) began to think with admiration of a man recommended on such high
authority, and would soon have gathered so warm an interest on the
subject, that if Mr. Tulliver had in the end declined to send Tom to
Stelling, Mr. Riley would have thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``friend of the old school''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Riley/Riley</b></font>)</div>a thoroughly pig-headed fellow.

<p/>If you blame Mr. Riley very severely for giving a recommendation on
such slight grounds, I must say you are rather hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>). Why
should an auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago, who had as good
as forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>appraiser</b></font>) free-school Latin, be expected to manifest a delicate
scrupulosity which is not always exhibited by gentlemen of the learned
professions, even in our present advanced stage of morality?

<p/>Besides, a man with the milk of human kindness in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can scarcely
abstain from doing a good-natured action, and one cannot be
good-natured all round. Nature herself occasionally quarters an
inconvenient parasite on an animal toward whom she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has otherwise no
ill will. What then? We admire her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) care for the parasite. If Mr. Riley
had shrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on valid
evidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) would not have helped Mr. Stelling to a paying pupil, and
that would not have been so well for the reverend gentleman. Consider,
too, that all the pleasant little dim ideas and complacencies--of
standing well with Timpson, of dispensing advice when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was asked for
it, of impressing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend Tulliver with additional respect, of
saying something, and saying it emphatically, with other inappreciably
minute ingredients that went along with the warm hearth and the
brandy-and-water to make up Mr. Riley's consciousness on this
occasion--would have been a mere blank.



<p/>Chapter IV

<p/>Tom Is Expected


<p/>It was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not allowed to go
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father in the gig when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to fetch Tom home from the
academy; but the morning was too wet, Mrs. Tulliver said, for a little
girl to go out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) best bonnet. Maggie took the opposite view very
strongly, and it was a direct consequence of this difference of
opinion that when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother was in the act of brushing out the
reluctant black crop Maggie suddenly rushed from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands and
dipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head in a basin of water standing near, in the vindictive
determination that there should be no more chance of curls that day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Tulliver, sitting stout and helpless
with the brushes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lap, <div class="bookquote">``what is to become of you if you're so
naughty? I'll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet when they come
next week, and they'll never love you any more. Oh dear, oh dear! look
at your clean pinafore, wet from top to bottom. Folks `ull think it's
a judgment on me as I've got such a child,--they'll think I've done
summat wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Before this remonstrance was finished, Maggie was already out of
hearing, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way toward the great attic that run under the old
high-pitched roof, shaking the water from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) black locks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ran,
like a Skye terrier escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) bath. This attic was Maggie's
favorite retreat on a wet day, when the weather was not too cold; here
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fretted out all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ill humors, and talked aloud to the worm-eaten
floors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with
cobwebs; and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept a Fetish which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) punished for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
misfortunes. This was the trunk of a large wooden doll, which once
stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks; but was
now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering. Three
nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie's
nine years of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been
suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old
Bible. The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than
usual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg. But
immediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) drove many
nails in she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort it, and make
believe to poultice it, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fury was abated; for even aunt Glegg
would be pitiable when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been hurt very much, and thoroughly
humiliated, so as to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) niece's pardon. Since then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had driven
no more nails in, but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and
beating the wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys
that made two square pillars supporting the roof. That was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
did this morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with a
passion that expelled every other form of consciousness,--even the
memory of the grievance that had caused it. As at last the sobs were
getting quieter, and the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam of
sunshine, falling through the wire lattice across the worm-eaten
shelves, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) throw away the Fetish and run to the window. The sun
was really breaking out; the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again;
the granary doors were open; and there was Yap, the queer
white-and-brown terrier, with one ear turned back, trotting about and
sniffing vaguely, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) were in search of a companion. It was
irresistible. Maggie tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair back and ran downstairs, seized
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet without putting it on, peeped, and then dashed along the
passage lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, and was quickly out in
the yard, whirling round like a Pythoness, and singing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whirled,
<div class="bookquote">``Yap, Yap, Tom's coming home!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>while Yap danced and barked round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
as much as to say, if there was any noise wanted he (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) was the dog for
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hegh, hegh, Miss! you'll make yourself giddy, an' tumble down i' the
dirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, the head miller, a tall, broad-shouldered man of
forty, black-eyed and black-haired, subdued by a general mealiness,
like an auricula.

<p/>Maggie paused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whirling and said, staggering a little, <div class="bookquote">``Oh no,
it doesn't make me giddy, Luke; may I go into the mill with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came
out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
dark eyes flash out with new fire. The resolute din, the unresting
motion of the great stones, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a dim, delicious awe as at the
presence of an uncontrollable force; the meal forever pouring,
pouring; the fine white powder softening all surfaces, and making the
very spidernets look like a faery lace-work; the sweet, pure scent of
the meal,--all helped to make Maggie feel that the mill was a little
world apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) outside every-day life. The spiders were
especially a subject of speculation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wondered if they had
any relatives outside the mill, for in that case there must be a
painful difficulty in their family intercourse,--a fat and floury
spider, accustomed to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fly well dusted with meal, must suffer
a little at a cousin's table where the fly was _au naturel_, and the
lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each other's appearance. But
the part of the mill she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) liked best was the topmost story,--the
corn-hutch, where there were the great heaps of grain, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could
sit on and slide down continually. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in the habit of taking this
recreation as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conversed with Luke, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very
communicative, wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to think well of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) understanding, as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
father did.

<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt it necessary to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) position with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the
present occasion for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat sliding on the heap of grain near
which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was busying himself, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, at that shrill pitch which was
requisite in mill-society,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you never read any book but the Bible, did you, Luke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Miss, an' not much o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, with great frankness.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm no reader, I aren't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But if I lent you one of my books, Luke? I've not got any _very_
pretty books that would be easy for you to read; but there's ``Pug's
Tour of Europe,<div class="bookquote">''--that would tell you all about the different sorts of
people in the world, and if you didn't understand the reading, the
pictures would help you; they show the looks and ways of the people,
and what they do. There are the Dutchmen, very fat, and smoking, you
know, and one sitting on a barrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pug</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Miss, I'n no opinion o' Dutchmen. There ben't much good i'
knowin' about _them_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they're our fellow-creatures, Luke; we ought to know about our
fellow-creatures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not much o' fellow-creaturs, I think, Miss; all I know--my old
master, as war a knowin' man, used to say, says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ``If e'er I sow my
wheat wi'out brinin', I'm a Dutchman,<div class="bookquote">'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>); an' that war as much
as to say as a Dutchman war a fool, or next door. Nay, nay, I aren't
goin' to bother mysen about Dutchmen. There's fools enoo, an' rogues
enoo, wi'out lookin' i' books for 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a Dutchman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke's unexpectedly decided
views about Dutchmen, ``perhaps you would like <div class="bookquote">``Animated Nature'
better; that's not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants and kangaroos,
and the civet-cat, and the sunfish, and a bird sitting on its tail,--I
forget its name. There are countries full of those creatures, instead
of horses and cows, you know. Shouldn't you like to know about them,
Luke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dutchmen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Miss, I'n got to keep count o' the flour an' corn; I can't do
wi' knowin' so many things besides my work. That's what brings folks
to the gallows,--knowin' everything but what they'n got to get their
bread by. An' they're mostly lies, I think, what's printed i' the
books: them printed sheets are, anyhow, as the men cry i' the
streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you're like my brother Tom, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, wishing to turn
the conversation agreeably; <div class="bookquote">``Tom's not fond of reading. I love Tom so
dearly, Luke,--better than anybody else in the world. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) grows up
I shall keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) house, and we shall always live together. I can tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) doesn't know. But I think Tom's clever, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
doesn't like books; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) makes beautiful whipcord and rabbit-pens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll be fine an' vexed, as the rabbits are all
dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>screamed Maggie, jumping up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sliding seat on the corn.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, Luke! What! the lop-eared one, and the spotted doe that Tom
spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) money to buy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As dead as moles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, fetching his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) comparison from the
unmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a piteous tone, while the big tears
rolled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek; <div class="bookquote">``Tom told me to take care of 'em, and I forgot.
What _shall_ I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, Miss, they were in that far tool-house, an' it was
nobody's business to see to 'em. I reckon Master Tom told Harry to
feed 'em, but there's no countin' on Harry; _he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s_ an offal creatur as
iver come about the primises, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembers nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own
inside--an' I wish it `ud gripe him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Luke, Tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day;
but how could I, when they didn't come into my head, you know? Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
will be so angry with me, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will, and so sorry about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
rabbits, and so am I sorry. Oh, what _shall_ I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you fret, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, soothingly; <div class="bookquote">``they're nash things,
them lop-eared rabbits; they'd happen ha' died, if they'd been fed.
Things out o' natur niver thrive: God A'mighty doesn't like 'em. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
made the rabbits' ears to lie back, an' it's nothin' but contrairiness
to make 'em hing down like a mastiff dog's. Master Tom `ull know
better nor buy such things another time. Don't you fret, Miss.. Will
you come along home wi' me, and see my wife? I'm a-goin' this minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>The invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie's grief, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tears gradually subsided as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) trotted along by Luke's side to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) pleasant cottage, which stood with its apple and pear trees, and
with the added dignity of a lean-to pigsty, at the other end of the
Mill fields. Mrs. Moggs, Luke's wife, was a decidedly agreeable
acquaintance. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) exhibited her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hospitality in bread and treacle, and
possessed various works of art. Maggie actually forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
any special cause of sadness this morning, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood on a chair to
look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son
in the costume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might have
been expected from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) defective moral character, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not, like
that accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense
with a wig. But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to feel more than usual pity for the career of
this weak young man, particularly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked at the picture where
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaned against a tree with a flaccid appearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee-breeches
unbuttoned and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wig awry, while the swine apparently of some
foreign breed, seemed to insult him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by their good spirits over their
feast of husks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back again, aren't you, Luke?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``For he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was very sorry, you know, and wouldn't do wrong again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d be no great shakes, I doubt, let's
feyther do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would for him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>That was a painful thought to Maggie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wished much that the
subsequent history of the young man had not been left a blank.



<p/>Chapter V

<p/>Tom Comes Home


<p/>Tom was to arrive early in the afternoon, and there was another
fluttering heart besides Maggie's when it was late enough for the
sound of the gig-wheels to be expected; for if Mrs. Tulliver had a
strong feeling, it was fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) boy. At last the sound
came,--that quick light bowling of the gig-wheels,--and in spite of
the wind, which was blowing the clouds about, and was not likely to
respect Mrs. Tulliver's curls and cap-strings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) came outside the
door, and even held her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) hand on Maggie's offending head, forgetting
all the griefs of the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) is, my sweet lad! But, Lord ha' mercy! he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s got never a
collar on; it's been lost on the road, I'll be bound, and spoilt the
set.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) arms open; Maggie jumped first on one leg
and then on the other; while Tom descended from the gig, and said,
with masculine reticence as to the tender emotions, <div class="bookquote">``Hallo! Yap--what!
are you there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) submitted to be kissed willingly enough, though Maggie
hung on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck in rather a strangling fashion, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) blue-gray
eyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
promised himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would begin to fish the first thing to-morrow
morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was one of those lads that grow everywhere in England, and
at twelve or thirteen years of age look as much alike as goslings,--a
lad with light-brown hair, cheeks of cream and roses, full lips,
indeterminate nose and eyebrows,--a physiognomy in which it seems
impossible to discern anything but the generic character to boyhood;
as different as possible from poor Maggie's phiz, which Nature seemed
to have moulded and colored with the most decided intention. But that
same Nature has the deep cunning which hides itself under the
appearance of openness, so that simple people think they can see
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) quite well, and all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is secretly preparing a
refutation of their confident prophecies. Under these average boyish
physiognomies that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seems to turn off by the gross, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conceals
some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) most rigid, inflexible purposes, some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) most
unmodifiable characters; and the dark-eyed, demonstrative, rebellious
girl may after all turn out to be a passive being compared with this
pink-and-white bit of masculinity with the indeterminate features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, confidentially, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into a corner, as soon
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother was gone out to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) box and the warm parlor had
taken off the chill he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had felt from the long drive, <div class="bookquote">``you don't know
what I've got in _my_ pockets,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head up and down as a
means of rousing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sense of mystery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``How stodgy they look, Tom! Is it marls -LRB-marbles-RRB-
or cobnuts?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie's heart sank a little, because Tom always said it
was <div class="bookquote">``no good''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>playing with _her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ at those games, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) played so badly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marls! no; I've swopped all my marls with the little fellows, and
cobnuts are no fun, you silly, only when the nuts are green. But see
here!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drew something half out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) right-hand pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I can see nothing but a bit
of yellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's--a--new--guess, Maggie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I _can't_ guess, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a spitfire, else I won't tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
hand back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket and looking determined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, imploringly, laying hold of the arm that was
held stiffly in the pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not cross, Tom; it was only because I
can't bear guessing. _Please_ be good to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's arm slowly relaxed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, then, it's a new
fish-line--two new uns,--one for you, Maggie, all to yourself. I
wouldn't go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save
the money; and Gibson and Spouncer fought with me because I wouldn't.
And here's hooks; see here--I say, _won't_ we go and fish to-morrow
down by the Round Pool? And you shall catch your own fish, Maggie and
put the worms on, and everything; won't it be fun?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's answer was to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms round Tom's neck and hug him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),
and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) without speaking, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) slowly
unwound some of the line, saying, after a pause,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't I a good brother, now, to buy you a line all to yourself? You
know, I needn't have bought it, if I hadn't liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very, very good--I _do_ love you, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom had put the line back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket, and was looking at the hooks
one by one, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the fellows fought me, because I wouldn't give in about the
toffee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! I wish they wouldn't fight at your school, Tom. Didn't it
hurt you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurt me? no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a
large pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
looked at meditatively as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) finger along it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
added,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave Spouncer a black eye, I know; that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got by wanting to
leather _me;_ I wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how brave you are, Tom! I think you're like Samson. If there came
a lion roaring at me, I think you'd fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), wouldn't you, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There's no
lions, only in the shows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but if we were in the lion countries--I mean in Africa, where
it's very hot; the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the
book where I read it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I should get a gun and shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you hadn't got a gun,--we might have gone out, you know, not
thinking, just as we go fishing; and then a great lion might run
toward us roaring, and we couldn't get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). What should you
do, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying, <div class="bookquote">``But the
lion _isn't_ coming. What's the use of talking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I like to fancy how it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Just think what you would do, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't bother, Maggie! you're such a silly. I shall go and see my
rabbits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's heart began to flutter with fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dared not tell the sad
truth at once, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walked after Tom in trembling silence as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
went out, thinking how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the news so as to soften at
once his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sorrow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) anger; for Maggie dreaded Tom's anger of all
things; it was quite a different anger from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, timidly, when they were out of doors, <div class="bookquote">``how much money
did you give for your rabbits?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two half-crowns and a sixpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, promptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've got a great deal more than that in my steel purse
upstairs. I'll ask mother to give it you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want _your_ money, you silly thing.
I've got a great deal more money than you, because I'm a boy. I always
have half-sovereigns and sovereigns for my Christmas boxes because I
shall be a man, and you only have five-shilling pieces, because you're
only a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but, Tom--if mother would let me give you two half-crowns and a
sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend, you know,
and buy some more rabbits with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More rabbits? I don't want any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but, Tom, they're all dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom stopped immediately in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walk and turned round toward Maggie.
<div class="bookquote">``You forgot to feed 'em, then, and Harry forgot?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) color
heightening for a moment, but soon subsiding. <div class="bookquote">``I'll pitch into Harry.
I'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned away. And I don't love you, Maggie. You sha'n't
go fishing with me to-morrow. I told you to go and see the rabbits
every day.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I forgot--and I couldn't help it, indeed, Tom. I'm so very
sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, while the tears rushed fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a naughty girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, severely, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm sorry I bought
you the fish-line. I don't love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, it's very cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>sobbed Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``I'd forgive you, if _you_
forgot anything--I wouldn't mind what you did--I'd forgive you and
love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you're silly; but I never _do_ forget things, _I_ don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please forgive me, Tom; my heart will break,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
shaking with sobs, clinging to Tom's arm, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wet cheek on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>Tom shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) off, and stopped again, saying in a peremptory tone,
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Maggie, you just listen. Aren't I a good brother to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-ye-es,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>sobbed Maggie, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chin rising and falling convulsedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I think about your fish-line all this quarter, and mean to buy
it, and saved my money o' purpose, and wouldn't go halves in the
toffee, and Spouncer fought me because I wouldn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-ye-es--and I--lo-lo-love you so, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're a naughty girl. Last holidays you licked the paint off my
lozenge-box, and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my
fish-line down when I'd set you to watch it, and you pushed your head
through my kite, all for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``if you'd minded what you were doing. And
you're a naughty girl, and you sha'n't go fishing with me to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>With this terrible conclusion, Tom ran away from Maggie toward the
mill, meaning to greet Luke there, and complain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) of Harry.

<p/>Maggie stood motionless, except from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sobs, for a minute or two;
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned round and ran into the house, and up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attic,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat on the floor and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head against the worm-eaten
shelf, with a crushing sense of misery. Tom was come home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
thought how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should be; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). What use
was anything if Tom didn't love her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)? Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was very cruel! Hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
wanted to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the money, and said how very sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was naughty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never been naughty to
Tom--had never _meant_ to be naughty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is cruel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie sobbed aloud, finding a wretched pleasure in
the hollow resonance that came through the long empty space of the
attic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) never thought of beating or grinding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) Fetish; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
too miserable to be angry.

<p/>These bitter sorrows of childhood! when sorrow is all new and strange,
when hope has not yet got wings to fly beyond the days and weeks, and
the space from summer to summer seems measureless.

<p/>Maggie soon thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been hours in the attic, and it must be
tea-time, and they were all having their tea, and not thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).
Well, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would stay up there and starve herself,--hide herself
behind the tub, and stay there all night,--and then they would all be
frightened, and Tom would be sorry. Thus Maggie thought in the pride
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) crept behind the tub; but presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to
cry again at the idea that they didn't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) being there. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
went down again to Tom now--would he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)? Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father
would be there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted Tom to
forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), not because his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). No,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would never go down if Tom didn't come to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). This
resolution lasted in great intensity for five dark minutes behind the
tub; but then the need of being loved--the strongest need in poor
Maggie's nature--began to wrestle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pride, and soon threw it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) crept from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tub into the twilight of the long attic, but
just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard a quick foot-step on the stairs.

<p/>Tom had been too much interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) talk with Luke, in going the
round of the premises, walking in and out where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pleased, and
whittling sticks without any particular reason,--except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't
whittle sticks at school,--to think of Maggie and the effect his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) anger
had produced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meant to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and that business having
been performed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) occupied himself with other matters, like a
practical person. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been called in to tea, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father
said, <div class="bookquote">``Why, where's the little wench?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Tulliver, almost at
the same moment, said, <div class="bookquote">``Where's your little sister?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>--both of them
having supposed that Maggie and Tom had been together all the
afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want to <div class="bookquote">``tell''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>of Maggie, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); for Tom Tulliver was a lad of honor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) been playing with you all this while?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the
father. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'d been thinking o' nothing but your coming home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) this two hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>says Tom, commencing on the
plumcake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s got drownded!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Tulliver, rising
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) seat and running to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) do so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) added, as became a fearful woman,
accusing she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) didn't know whom of she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) didn't know what.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s none drownded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``You've been
naughty to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), I doubt, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I haven't, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s in
the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps up in that attic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``a-singing and talking
to herself, and forgetting all about meal-times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) down, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, rather
sharply,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) perspicacity or his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) fatherly fondness for Maggie making
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) suspect that the lad had been hard upon <div class="bookquote">``the little un,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>else she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
would never have left his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``And be good to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), do you hear? Else
I'll let you know better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom never disobeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, for Mr. Tulliver was a peremptory man,
and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, would never let anybody get hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whip-hand;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went out rather sullenly, carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) piece of plumcake, and
not intending to reprieve Maggie's punishment, which was no more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deserved. Tom was only thirteen, and had no decided views in
grammar and arithmetic, regarding them for the most part as open
questions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was particularly clear and positive on one
point,--namely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would punish everybody who deserved it. Why,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't have minded being punished himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deserved it; but,
then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never _did_ deserve it.

<p/>It was Tom's step, then, that Maggie heard on the stairs, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
need of love had triumphed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pride, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was going down with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) swollen eyes and dishevelled hair to beg for pity. At least her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father would stroke her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head and say, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, my wench.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>It is a
wonderful subduer, this need of love,--this hunger of the heart,--as
peremptory as that other hunger by which Nature forces us to submit to
the yoke, and change the face of the world.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew Tom's step, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart began to beat violently with
the sudden shock of hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only stood still at the top of the stairs
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Maggie, you're to come down.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rushed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and
clung round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck, sobbing, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, please forgive me--I can't
bear it--I will always be good--always remember things--do love
me--please, dear Tom!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>We learn to restrain ourselves as we get older. We keep apart when we
have quarrelled, express ourselves in well-bred phrases, and in this
way preserve a dignified alienation, showing much firmness on one
side, and swallowing much grief on the other. We no longer approximate
in our behavior to the mere impulsiveness of the lower animals, but
conduct ourselves in every respect like members of a highly civilized
society. Maggie and Tom were still very much like young animals, and
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could rub her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ear in a random
sobbing way; and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been
used to answer to Maggie's fondling, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) behaved with a
weakness quite inconsistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) resolution to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as much
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deserved. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) actually began to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in return, and say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, then, Magsie; here, eat a bit o' cake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's sobs began to subside, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mouth for the cake
and bit a piece; and then Tom bit a piece, just for company, and they
ate together and rubbed each other's cheeks and brows and noses
together, while they ate, with a humiliating resemblance to two
friendly ponies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, Magsie, and have tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom at last, when there was
no more cake except what was down-stairs.

<p/>So ended the sorrows of this day, and the next morning Maggie was
trotting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own fishing-rod in one hand and a handle of the
basket in the other, stepping always, by a peculiar gift, in the
muddiest places, and looking darkly radiant from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
beaver-bonnet because Tom was good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had told Tom, however,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to put the worms on the hook for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
although she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) word when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that worms couldn't
feel -LRB-it was Tom's private opinion that it didn't much matter if they
did-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew all about worms, and fish, and those things; and what
birds were mischievous, and how padlocks opened, and which way the
handles of the gates were to be lifted. Maggie thought this sort of
knowledge was very wonderful,--much more difficult than remembering
what was in the books; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was rather in awe of Tom's superiority,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was the only person who called her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knowledge <div class="bookquote">``stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>and did
not feel surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cleverness. Tom, indeed, was of opinion that
Maggie was a silly little thing; all girls were silly,--they couldn't
throw a stone so as to hit anything, couldn't do anything with a
pocket-knife, and were frightened at frogs. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was very fond of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister, and meant always to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
housekeeper, and punish her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did wrong.

<p/>They were on their way to the Round Pool,--that wonderful pool, which
the floods had made a long while ago. No one knew how deep it was; and
it was mysterious, too, that it should be almost a perfect round,
framed in with willows and tall reeds, so that the water was only to
be seen when you got close to the brink. The sight of the old favorite
spot always heightened Tom's good humor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spoke to Maggie in the
most amicable whispers, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened the precious basket and prepared
their tackle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) line for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and put the rod into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand. Maggie thought it probable that the small fish would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hook, and the large ones to Tom's. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had forgotten all about the
fish, and was looking dreamily at the glassy water, when Tom said, in
a loud whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Look, look, Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>and came running to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
from snatching her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) line away.

<p/>Maggie was frightened lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been doing something wrong, as
usual, but presently Tom drew out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) line and brought a large tench
bouncing on the grass.

<p/>Tom was excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Magsie, you little duck! Empty the basket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was not conscious of unusual merit, but it was enough that Tom
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) Magsie, and was pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). There was nothing to mar
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) listened
to the light dripping sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle
rustling, as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their
happy whisperings also. Maggie thought it would make a very nice
heaven to sit by the pool in that way, and never be scolded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) never
knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a bite till Tom told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) liked fishing very
much.

<p/>It was one of their happy mornings. They trotted along and sat down
together, with no thought that life would ever change much for them;
they would only get bigger and not go to school, and it would always
be like the holidays; they would always live together and be fond of
each other. And the mill with its booming; the great chestnut-tree
under which they played at houses; their own little river, the Ripple,
where the banks seemed like home, and Tom was always seeing the
water-rats, while Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the reeds,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) forgot and dropped afterward; above all, the great Floss,
along which they wandered with a sense of travel, to see the rushing
spring-tide, the awful Eagle, come up like a hungry monster, or to see
the Great Ash which had once wailed and groaned like a man, these
things would always be just the same to them. Tom thought people were
at a disadvantage who lived on any other spot of the globe; and
Maggie, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) read about Christiana passing <div class="bookquote">``the river over which
there is no bridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christiana</b></font>)</div>always saw the Floss between the green pastures
by the Great Ash.

<p/>Life did change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they were not wrong in
believing that the thoughts and loves of these first years would
always make part of their lives. We could never have loved the earth
so well if we had had no childhood in it,--if it were not the earth
where the same flowers come up again every spring that we used to
gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the
grass; the same hips and haws on the autumn's hedgerows; the same
redbreasts that we used to call <div class="bookquote">``God's birds,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>because they did no
harm to the precious crops. What novelty is worth that sweet monotony
where everything is known, and _loved_ because it is known?

<p/>The wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the young yellow-brown
foliage of the oaks between me and the blue sky, the white
star-flowers and the blue-eyed speedwell and the ground ivy at my
feet, what grove of tropic palms, what strange ferns or splendid
broad-petalled blossoms, could ever thrill such deep and delicate
fibres within me as this home scene? These familiar flowers, these
well-remembered bird-notes, this sky, with its fitful brightness,
these furrowed and grassy fields, each with a sort of personality
given to it by the capricious hedgerows,--such things as these are the
mother-tongue of our imagination, the language that is laden with all
the subtle, inextricable associations the fleeting hours of our
childhood left behind them. Our delight in the sunshine on the
deep-bladed grass to-day might be no more than the faint perception of
wearied souls, if it were not for the sunshine and the grass in the
far-off years which still live in us, and transform our perception
into love.



<p/>Chapter VI

<p/>The Aunts and Uncles Are Coming


<p/>It was Easter week, and Mrs. Tulliver's cheesecakes were more
exquisitely light than usual. <div class="bookquote">``A puff o' wind `ud make 'em blow about
like feathers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kezia</b></font>)</div>Kezia the housemaid said, feeling proud to live under
a mistress who could make such pastry; so that no season or
circumstances could have been more propitious for a family party, even
if it had not been advisable to consult sister Glegg and sister Pullet
about Tom's going to school.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd as lief not invite sister Deane this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver,
<div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)'s as jealous and having as can be, and's allays trying to
make the worst o' my poor children to their aunts and uncles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) to come. I never hardly get a
bit o' talk with Deane now; we haven't had him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) this six months. What's
it matter what she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) says? My children need be beholding to nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what you allays say, Mr. Tulliver; but I'm sure there's nobody
o' your side, neither aunt nor uncle, to leave 'em so much as a
five-pound note for a leggicy. And there's sister Glegg, and sister
Pullet too, saving money unknown, for they put by all their own
interest and butter-money too; their husbands buy 'em everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tulliver was a mild woman, but even a sheep will face about a
little when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) has lambs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tchuh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``It takes a big loaf when there's many to
breakfast. What signifies your sisters' bits o' money when they've got

country cry shame on 'em when they are dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) won't get 'em to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``for
my children are so awk`ard wi' their aunts and uncles. Maggie's ten

And there's Lucy Dean's such a good child,--you may set her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on a
stool, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'ll sit for an hour together, and never offer to
get off. I can't help loving the child as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was my own; and I'm
sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s more like _my_ child than sister Deane's, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)'d allays
a very poor color for one of our family, sister Deane had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, if you're fond o' the child, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) father and mother to
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) with 'em. And won't you ask their aunt and uncle Moss too,
and some o' _their_ children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, Mr. Tulliver, why, there'd be eight people besides the
children, and I must put two more leaves i' the table, besides
reaching down more o' the dinner-service; and you know as well as I do
as _my_ sisters and _your_ sister don't suit well together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, do as you like, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
hat and walking out to the mill. Few wives were more submissive than
Mrs. Tulliver on all points unconnected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) family relations; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had been a Miss Dodson, and the Dodsons were a very respectable
family indeed,--as much looked up to as any in their own parish, or
the next to it. The Miss Dodsons had always been thought to hold up
their heads very high, and no one was surprised the two eldest had
married so well,--not at an early age, for that was not the practice
of the Dodson family. There were particular ways of doing everything
in that family: particular ways of bleaching the linen, of making the
cowslip wine, curing the hams, and keeping the bottled gooseberries;
so that no daughter of that house could be indifferent to the
privilege of having been born a Dodson, rather than a Gibson or a
Watson. Funerals were always conducted with peculiar propriety in the
Dodson family: the hat-bands were never of a blue shade, the gloves
never split at the thumb, everybody was a mourner who ought to be, and
there were always scarfs for the bearers. When one of the family was
in trouble or sickness, all the rest went to visit the unfortunate
member, usually at the same time, and did not shrink from uttering the
most disagreeable truths that correct family feeling dictated; if the
illness or trouble was the sufferer's own fault, it was not in the
practice of the Dodson family to shrink from saying so. In short,
there was in this family a peculiar tradition as to what was the right
thing in household management and social demeanor, and the only bitter
circumstance attending this superiority was a painful inability to
approve the condiments or the conduct of families ungoverned by the
Dodson tradition. A female Dodson, when in <div class="bookquote">``strange houses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodson/Miss Dodson</b></font>)</div>always
ate dry bread with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) tea, and declined any sort of preserves, having
no confidence in the butter, and thinking that the preserves had
probably begun to ferment from want of due sugar and boiling. There
were some Dodsons less like the family than others, that was admitted;
but in so far as they were <div class="bookquote">``kin,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>they were of necessity better than
those who were <div class="bookquote">``no kin.''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>And it is remarkable that while no individual
Dodson was satisfied with any other individual Dodson, each was
satisfied, not only with him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) self, but with the Dodsons
collectively. The feeblest member of a family--the one who has the
least character--is often the merest epitome of the family habits and
traditions; and Mrs. Tulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild
one, as small-beer, so long as it is anything, is only describable as
very weak ale: and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) had groaned a little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) youth under
the yoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) elder sisters, and still shed occasional tears at
their sisterly reproaches, it was not in Mrs. Tulliver to be an
innovator on the family ideas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was thankful to have been a Dodson,
and to have one child who took after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) own family, at least in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
features and complexion, in liking salt and in eating beans, which a
Tulliver never did.

<p/>In other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
as far from appreciating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``kin''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on the mother's side as Maggie
herself, generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the
most portable food, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) received timely warning that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunts and
uncles were coming,--a moral symptom from which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunt Glegg deduced
the gloomiest views of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) future. It was rather hard on Maggie that
Tom always absconded without letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into the secret, but the
weaker sex are acknowledged to be serious _impedimenta_ in cases of
flight.

<p/>On Wednesday, the day before the aunts and uncles were coming, there
were such various and suggestive scents, as of plumcakes in the oven
and jellies in the hot state, mingled with the aroma of gravy, that it
was impossible to feel altogether gloomy: there was hope in the air.
Tom and Maggie made several inroads into the kitchen, and, like other
marauders, were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed
to carry away a sufficient load of booty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, as they sat on the boughs of the elder-tree,
eating their jam-puffs, <div class="bookquote">``shall you run away to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, slowly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) puff, and was eying
the third, which was to be divided between them,--<div class="bookquote">``no, I sha'n't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom? Because Lucy's coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket-knife and holding it over the puff,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head on one side in a dubitative manner. -LRB-It was a difficult
problem to divide that very irregular polygon into two equal parts.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``What do _I_ care about Lucy? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s only a girl,--_she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_ can't play at
bandy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the tipsy-cake, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, exerting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hypothetic
powers, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leaned forward toward Tom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes fixed on the
hovering knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you silly, that'll be good the day after. It's the pudden. I know
what the pudden's to be,--apricot roll-up--O my buttons!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>With this interjection, the knife descended on the puff, and it was in
two, but the result was not satisfactory to Tom, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) still eyed the
halves doubtfully. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut your eyes, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never mind what for. Shut 'em when I tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie obeyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, which'll you have, Maggie,--right hand or left?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have that with the jam run out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes
shut to please Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't like that, you silly. You may have it if it comes to
you fair, but I sha'n't give it you without. Right or left,--you
choose, now. Ha-a-a!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in a tone of exasperation, as Maggie
peeped. <div class="bookquote">``You keep your eyes shut, now, else you sha'n't have any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's power of sacrifice did not extend so far; indeed, I fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
cared less that Tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff,
than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should be pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the best bit.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes quite close, till Tom told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``say which,''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Left hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in rather a bitter tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! the bit with the jam run out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; here, take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, firmly, handing, decidedly the best
piece to Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, Tom, have it; I don't mind--I like the other; please take
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I sha'n't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, almost crossly, beginning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own
inferior piece.

<p/>Maggie, thinking it was no use to contend further, began too, and ate
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity. But Tom
had finished first, and had to look on while Maggie ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) last
morsel or two, feeling in himself a capacity for more. Maggie didn't
know Tom was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was seesawing on the elder-bough,
lost to almost everything but a vague sense of jam and idleness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you greedy thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had swallowed the last
morsel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was conscious of having acted very fairly, and thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
ought to have considered this, and made up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would
have refused a bit of hers beforehand, but one is naturally at a
different point of view before and after one's own share of puff is
swallowed.

<p/>Maggie turned quite pale. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, why didn't you ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't going to ask you for a bit, you greedy. You might have
thought of it without, when you knew I gave you the best bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wanted you to have it; you know I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in an
injured tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I wasn't going to do what wasn't fair, like Spouncer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
always takes the best bit, if you don't punch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for it; and if you
choose the best with your eyes shut, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands. But if I go
halves, I'll go 'em fair; only I wouldn't be a greedy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>With this cutting innuendo, Tom jumped down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bough, and threw
a stone with a <div class="bookquote">``hoigh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>as a friendly attention to Yap, who had also
been looking on while the eatables vanished, with an agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
ears and feelings which could hardly have been without bitterness. Yet
the excellent dog accepted Tom's attention with as much alacrity as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been treated quite generously.

<p/>But Maggie, gifted with that superior power of misery which
distinguishes the human being, and places him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at a proud distance from
the most melancholy chimpanzee, sat still on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bough, and gave
herself up to the keen sense of unmerited reproach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have
given the world not to have eaten all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) puff, and to have saved some
of it for Tom. Not but that the puff was very nice, for Maggie's
palate was not at all obtuse, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have gone without it many
times over, sooner than Tom should call her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) greedy and be cross with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't have it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ate it without
thinking; how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) help it? The tears flowed so plentifully that
Maggie saw nothing around her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for the next ten minutes; but by that
time resentment began to give way to the desire of reconciliation, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) jumped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bough to look for Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was no longer in the
paddock behind the rickyard; where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) likely to be gone, and Yap
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? Maggie ran to the high bank against the great holly-tree,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could see far away toward the Floss. There was Tom; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
heart sank again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw how far off he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way to the great
river, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had another companion besides Yap,--naughty Bob
Jakin, whose official, if not natural, function of frightening the
birds was just now at a standstill. Maggie felt sure that Bob was
wicked, without very distinctly knowing why; unless it was because
Bob's mother was a dreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer
round house down the river; and once, when Maggie and Tom had wandered
thither, there rushed out a brindled dog that wouldn't stop barking;
and when Bob's mother came out after it, and screamed above the
barking to tell them not to be frightened, Maggie thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
scolding them fiercely, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart beat with terror. Maggie thought
it very likely that the round house had snakes on the floor, and bats
in the bedroom; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seen Bob take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cap to show Tom a
little snake that was inside it, and another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a handful of
young bats: altogether, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was an irregular character, perhaps even
slightly diabolical, judging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) intimacy with snakes and bats;
and to crown all, when Tom had Bob for a companion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't mind
about Maggie, and would never let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>It must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob's company. How could it be
otherwise? Bob knew, directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) saw a bird's egg, whether it was a
swallow's, or a tomtit's, or a yellow-hammer's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) found out all the
wasps' nests, and could set all sort of traps; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could climb the
trees like a squirrel, and had quite a magical power of detecting
hedgehogs and stoats; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had courage to do things that were rather
naughty, such as making gaps in the hedgerows, throwing stones after
the sheep, and killing a cat that was wandering _incognito_.

<p/>Such qualities in an inferior, who could always be treated with
authority in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) superior knowingness, had necessarily a
fatal fascination for Tom; and every holiday-time Maggie was sure to
have days of grief because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had gone off with Bob.

<p/>Well! there was no hope for it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was gone now, and Maggie could
think of no comfort but to sit down by the hollow, or wander by the
hedgerow, and fancy it was all different, refashioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) little
world into just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should like it to be.

<p/>Maggie's was a troublous life, and this was the form in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) opium.

<p/>Meanwhile Tom, forgetting all about Maggie and the sting of reproach
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart, was hurrying along with Bob, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
had met accidentally, to the scene of a great rat-catching in a
neighboring barn. Bob knew all about this particular affair, and spoke
of the sport with an enthusiasm which no one who is not either
divested of all manly feeling, or pitiably ignorant of rat-catching,
can fail to imagine. For a person suspected of preternatural
wickedness, Bob was really not so very villanous-looking; there was
even something agreeable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) snub-nosed face, with its close-curled
border of red hair. But then his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) trousers were always rolled up at the
knee, for the convenience of wading on the slightest notice; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
virtue, supposing it to exist, was undeniably <div class="bookquote">``virtue in rags,''  (<font color='red'><b>philosophers</b></font>)</div>which,
on the authority even of bilious philosophers, who think all
well-dressed merit overpaid, is notoriously likely to remain
unrecognized -LRB-perhaps because it is seen so seldom-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the chap as owns the ferrets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, in a hoarse treble
voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) shuffled along, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) blue eyes fixed on the river,
like an amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for darting in. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
lives up the Kennel Yard at Sut Ogg's, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s the biggest
rot-catcher anywhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) is. I'd sooner, be a rot-catcher nor
anything, I would. The moles is nothing to the rots. But Lors! you mun
ha' ferrets. Dogs is no good. Why, there's that dog, now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>Bob
continued, pointing with an air of disgust toward Yap, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s no more
good wi' a rot nor nothin'. I see it myself, I did, at the
rot-catchin' i' your feyther's barn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Yap</b></font>)</div><p/>Yap, feeling the withering influence of this scorn, tucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) tail in
and shrank close to Tom's leg, who felt a little hurt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but had
not the superhuman courage to seem behindhand with Bob in contempt for
a dog who made so poor a figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Yap's no good at sport. I'll have regular good
dogs for rats and everything, when I've done school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hev ferrets, Measter Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, eagerly,--<div class="bookquote">``them white ferrets
wi' pink eyes; Lors, you might catch your own rots, an' you might put
a rot in a cage wi' a ferret, an' see 'em fight, you might. That's
what I'd do, I know, an' it `ud be better fun a`most nor seein' two
chaps fight,--if it wasn't them chaps as sold cakes an' oranges at the
Fair, as the things flew out o' their baskets, an' some o' the cakes
was smashed--But they tasted just as good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>added Bob, by way of note
or addendum, after a moment's pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, I say, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in a tone of deliberation, <div class="bookquote">``ferrets are
nasty biting things,--they'll bite a fellow without being set on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lors! why that's the beauty on 'em. If a chap lays hold o' your

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment a striking incident made the boys pause suddenly in
their walk. It was the plunging of some small body in the water from
among the neighboring bulrushes; if it was not a water-rat, Bob
intimated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was ready to undergo the most unpleasant
consequences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hoigh! Yap,--hoigh! there he (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, as
the little black snout made its arrowy course to the opposite bank.
<div class="bookquote">``Seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>), lad! seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Yap</b></font>)</div><p/>Yap agitated his (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) ears and wrinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) brows, but declined to plunge,
trying whether barking would not answer the purpose just as well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh! you coward!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, and kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) over, feeling humiliated
as a sportsman to possess so poor-spirited an animal. Bob abstained
from remark and passed on, choosing, however, to walk in the shallow
edge of the overflowing river by way of change.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'s none so full now, the Floss isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) kicked the
water up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), with an agreeable sense of being insolent to it.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, last `ear, the meadows was all one sheet o' water, they was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, whose mind was prone to see an opposition between
statements that were really accordant,--<div class="bookquote">``but there was a big flood
once, when the Round Pool was made. _I_ know there was, 'cause father
says so. And the sheep and cows all drowned, and the boats went all
over the fields ever such a way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ don't care about a flood comin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob; <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind the
water, no more nor the land. I'd swim, _I_ would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
imagination becoming quite active under the stimulus of that dread.
<div class="bookquote">``When I'm a man, I shall make a boat with a wooden house on the top of
it, like Noah's ark, and keep plenty to eat in it,--rabbits and
things,--all ready. And then if the flood came, you know, Bob, I
shouldn't mind. And I'd take you in, if I saw you swimming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added,
in the tone of a benevolent patron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I aren't frighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, to whom hunger did not appear so
appalling. <div class="bookquote">``But I'd get in an' knock the rabbits on th' head when you
wanted to eat 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, and I should have halfpence, and we'd play at heads-and-tails,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, not contemplating the possibility that this recreation might
have fewer charms for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mature age. <div class="bookquote">``I'd divide fair to begin with,
and then we'd see who'd win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a halfpenny o' my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, proudly, coming out of the
water and tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) halfpenny in the air. <div class="bookquote">``Yeads or tails?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tails,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, instantly fired with the desire to win.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's yeads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, hastily, snatching up the halfpenny as it
fell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, loudly and peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">``You give me the
halfpenny; I've won it fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sha'n't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, holding it tight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll make you; see if I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't make me do nothing, you can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll make you care, you cheat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, collaring Bob and
shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You get out wi' you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, giving Tom a kick.

<p/>Tom's blood was thoroughly up: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went at Bob with a lunge and threw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) down, but Bob seized hold and kept it like a cat, and pulled Tom
down after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). They struggled fiercely on the ground for a moment or
two, till Tom, pinning Bob down by the shoulders, thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had the
mastery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_, say you'll give me the halfpenny now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, with
difficulty, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) exerted himself to keep the command of Bob's
arms.

<p/>But at this moment Yap, who had been running on before, returned
barking to the scene of action, and saw a favorable opportunity for
biting Bob's bare leg not only with inpunity but with honor. The pain
from Yap's teeth, instead of surprising Bob into a relaxation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
hold, gave it a fiercer tenacity, and with a new exertion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) force
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pushed Tom backward and got uppermost. But now Yap, who could get
no sufficient purchase before, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) teeth in a new place, so that
Bob, harassed in this way, let go his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hold of Tom, and, almost
throttling Yap, flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) into the river. By this time Tom was up
again, and before Bob had quite recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) balance after the act of
swinging Yap, Tom fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) down, and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees
firmly on Bob's chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You give me the halfpenny now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I sha'n't take it; you give it me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob took the halfpenny out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pocket, and threw it away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
on the ground.

<p/>Tom loosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hold, and left Bob to rise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There the halfpenny lies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want your halfpenny; I
wouldn't have kept it. But you wanted to cheat; I hate a cheat. I
sha'n't go along with you any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) added, turning round homeward,
not without casting a regret toward the rat-catching and other
pleasures which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) must relinquish along with Bob's society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may let it alone, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>Bob called out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall cheat
if I like; there's no fun i' playing else; and I know where there's a
goldfinch's nest, but I'll take care _you_ don't. An' you're a nasty
fightin' turkey-cock, you are--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom walked on without looking around, and Yap followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) example,
the cold bath having moderated his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) passions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along wi' you, then, wi' your drowned dog; I wouldn't own such a
dog--_I_ wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, getting louder, in a last effort to
sustain his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) defiance. But Tom was not to be provoked into turning
round, and Bob's voice began to falter a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' I'n gi'en you everything, an' showed you everything, an' niver
wanted nothin' from you. An' there's your horn-handed knife, then as
you gi'en me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here Bob flung the knife as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could after Tom's
retreating footsteps. But it produced no effect, except the sense in
Bob's mind that there was a terrible void in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) lot, now that knife
was gone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) stood still till Tom had passed through the gate and disappeared
behind the hedge. The knife would do not good on the ground there; it
wouldn't vex Tom; and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in
Bob's mind compared with the love of a pocket-knife. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) very fingers
sent entreating thrills that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would go and clutch that familiar
rough buck's-horn handle, which they had so often grasped for mere
affection, as it lay idle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pocket. And there were two blades,
and they had just been sharpened! What is life without a pocket-knife
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) who has once tasted a higher existence? No; to throw the handle
after the hatchet is a comprehensible act of desperation, but to throw
one's pocket-knife after an implacable friend is clearly in every
sense a hyperbole, or throwing beyond the mark. So Bob shuffled back
to the spot where the beloved knife lay in the dirt, and felt quite a
new pleasure in clutching it again after the temporary separation, in
opening one blade after the other, and feeling their edge with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
well-hardened thumb. Poor Bob! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was not sensitive on the point of
honor, not a chivalrous character. That fine moral aroma would not
have been thought much of by the public opinion of Kennel Yard, which
was the very focus or heart of Bob's world, even if it could have made
itself perceptible there; yet, for all that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was not utterly a
sneak and a thief as our friend Tom had hastily decided.

<p/>But Tom, you perceive, was rather a Rhadamanthine personage, having
more than the usual share of boy's justice in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),--the justice that
desires to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt, and is
troubled with no doubts concerning the exact amount of their deserts.
Maggie saw a cloud on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brow when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came home, which checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
joy at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coming so much sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had expected, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dared
hardly speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood silently throwing the small
gravel-stones into the mill-dam. It is not pleasant to give up a
rat-catching when you have set your mind on it. But if Tom had told
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strongest feeling at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have said, <div class="bookquote">``I'd do just
the same again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) usual mode of viewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) past actions;
whereas Maggie was always wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done something different.



<p/>Chapter VII

<p/>Enter the Aunts and Uncles


<p/>The Dodsons were certainly a handsome family, and Mrs. Glegg was not
the least handsome of the sisters. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sat in Mrs. Tulliver's
arm-chair, no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of
fifty she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a very comely face and figure, though Tom and Maggie
considered their aunt Glegg as the type of ugliness. It is true she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
despised the advantages of costume, for though, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) often observed,
no woman had better clothes, it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) new things
out before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old ones. Other women, if they liked, might have their
best thread-lace in every wash; but when Mrs. Glegg died, it would be
found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had better lace laid by in the right-hand drawer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
wardrobe in the Spotted Chamber than ever Mrs. Wooll of St. Ogg's had
bought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wooll</b></font>) life, although Mrs. Wooll wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Wooll</b></font>) lace before it was
paid for. So of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wooll</b></font>) curled fronts: Mrs. Glegg had doubtless the
glossiest and crispest brown curls in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) drawers, as well as curls in
various degrees of fuzzy laxness; but to look out on the week-day
world from under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most
dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular.
Occasionally, indeed, Mrs. Glegg wore one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) third-best fronts on
a week-day visit, but not at a sister's house; especially not at Mrs.
Tulliver's, who, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) marriage, had hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister's feelings
greatly by wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own hair, though, as Mrs. Glegg observed to
Mrs. Deane, a mother of a family, like Bessy, with a husband always
going to law, might have been expected to know better. But Bessy was
always weak!

<p/>So if Mrs. Glegg's front to-day was more fuzzy and lax than usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
had a design under it: she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) intended the most pointed and cutting
allusion to Mrs. Tulliver's bunches of blond curls, separated from
each other by a due wave of smoothness on each side of the parting.
Mrs. Tulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg's
unkindness on the subject of these unmatronly curls, but the
consciousness of looking the handsomer for them naturally administered
support. Mrs. Glegg chose to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) bonnet in the house
to-day,--untied and tilted slightly, of course--a frequent practice of
hers when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was on a visit, and happened to be in a severe humor:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) didn't know what draughts there might be in strange houses. For
the same reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wore a small sable tippet, which reached just to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) shoulders, and was very far from meeting across her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) well-formed
chest, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) long neck was protected by a _chevaux-de-frise_ of
miscellaneous frilling. One would need to be learned in the fashions
of those times to know how far in the rear of them Mrs. Glegg's
slate-colored silk gown must have been; but from certain
constellations of small yellow spots upon it, and a mouldy odor about
it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest, it was probable that it
belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come
recently into wear.

<p/>Mrs. Glegg held her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) large gold watch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) hand with the many-doubled
chain round her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) fingers, and observed to Mrs. Tulliver, who had just
returned from a visit to the kitchen, that whatever it might be by
other people's clocks and watches, it was gone half-past twelve by
hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what ails sister Pullet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``It used to be
the way in our family for one to be as early as another,--I'm sure it
was so in my poor father's time,--and not for one sister to sit half
an hour before the others came. But if the ways o' the family are
altered, it sha'n't be _my_ fault; _I'll_ never be the one to come
into a house when all the rest are going away. I wonder _at_ sister
Deane,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) used to be more like me. But if you'll take my advice,
Bessy, you'll put the dinner forrard a bit, sooner than put it back,
because folks are late as ought to ha' known better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, there's no fear but what they'll be all here in time,
sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mild-peevish tone. <div class="bookquote">``The dinner
won't be ready till half-past one. But if it's long for you to wait,
let me fetch you a cheesecake and a glass o' wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bessy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, with a bitter smile and a scarcely
perceptible toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``I should ha' thought you'd known your
own sister better. I never _did_ eat between meals, and I'm not going
to begin. Not but what I hate that nonsense of having your dinner at
half-past one, when you might have it at one. You was never brought up
in that way, Bessy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Jane, what can I do? Mr. Tulliver doesn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) dinner before
two o'clock, but I put it half an hour earlier because o' you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I know how it is with husbands,--they're for putting
everything off; they'll put the dinner off till after tea, if they've
got wives as are weak enough to give in to such work; but it's a pity
for you, Bessy, as you haven't got more strength o' mind. It'll be
well if your children don't suffer for it. And I hope you've not gone
and got a great dinner for us,--going to expense for your sisters, as
`ud sooner eat a crust o' dry bread nor help to ruin you with
extravagance. I wonder you don't take pattern by your sister Deane;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)'s far more sensible. And here you've got two children to provide
for, and your husband's spent your fortin i' going to law, and's
likely to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own too. A boiled joint, as you could make broth
of for the kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Glegg added, in a tone of emphatic protest,
<div class="bookquote">``and a plain pudding, with a spoonful o' sugar, and no spice, `ud be
far more becoming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>With sister Glegg in this humor, there was a cheerful prospect for the
day. Mrs. Tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), any
more than a water-fowl that puts out its leg in a deprecating manner
can be said to quarrel with a boy who throws stones. But this point of
the dinner was a tender one, and not at all new, so that Mrs. Tulliver
could make the same answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had often made before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulliver says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) always _will_ have a good dinner for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) friends
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) can pay for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s a right to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
likes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own house, sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bessy, _I_ can't leave your children enough out o' my savings
to keep 'em from ruin. And you mustn't look to having any o' Mr.
Glegg's money, for it's well if I don't go first,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) comes of a
long-lived family; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was to die and leave me well for my life,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'d tie all the money up to go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own kin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>The sound of wheels while Mrs. Glegg was speaking was an interruption
highly welcome to Mrs. Tulliver, who hastened out to receive sister
Pullet; it must be sister Pullet, because the sound was that of a
four-wheel.

<p/>Mrs. Glegg tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) head and looked rather sour about the mouth at
the thought of the <div class="bookquote">``four-wheel.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had a strong opinion on that
subject.

<p/>Sister Pullet was in tears when the one-horse chaise stopped before
Mrs. Tulliver's door, and it was apparently requisite that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should
shed a few more before getting out; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband and Mrs.
Tulliver stood ready to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sat still and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head
sadly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) tears at the vague distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, whativer is the matter, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not
an imaginative woman, but it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that the large
toilet-glass in sister Pullet's best bedroom was possibly broken for
the second time.

<p/>There was no reply but a further shake of the head, as Mrs. Pullet
slowly rose and got down from the chaise, not without casting a glance
at Mr. Pullet to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) was guarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) handsome silk dress from
injury. Mr. Pullet was a small man, with a high nose, small twinkling
eyes, and thin lips, in a fresh-looking suit of black and a white
cravat, that seemed to have been tied very tight on some higher
principle than that of mere personal ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) bore about the same
relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) tall, good-looking wife, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) balloon sleeves,
abundant mantle, and a large befeathered and beribboned bonnet, as a
small fishing-smack bears to a brig with all its sails spread.

<p/>It is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity
introduced into the emotions by a high state of civilization, the
sight of a fashionably dressed female in grief. From the sorrow of a
Hottentot to that of a woman in large buckram sleeves, with several
bracelets on each arm, an architectural bonnet, and delicate ribbon
strings, what a long series of gradations! In the enlightened child of
civilization the abandonment characteristic of grief is checked and
varied in the subtlest manner, so as to present an interesting problem
to the analytic mind. If, with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded
by the mist of tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were to walk with a too-devious step through
a door-place, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might crush her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) buckram sleeves too, and the deep
consciousness of this possibility produces a composition of forces by
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes a line that just clears the door-post. Perceiving that
the tears are hurrying fast, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unpins her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strings and throws them
languidly backward, a touching gesture, indicative, even in the
deepest gloom, of the hope in future dry moments when cap-strings will
once more have a charm. As the tears subside a little, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
head leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) endures that terrible moment when grief, which has made all things
else a weariness, has itself become weary; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks down pensively at
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bracelets, and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied
fortuity which would be gratifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind if it were once more in
a calm and healthy state.

<p/>Mrs. Pullet brushed each door-post with great nicety, about the
latitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) shoulders -LRB-at that period a woman was truly ridiculous
to an instructed eye if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not measure a yard and a half across
the shoulders-RRB-, and having done that sent the muscles of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face in
quest of fresh tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) advanced into the parlor where Mrs. Glegg
was seated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sister, you're late; what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg,
rather sharply, as they shook hands.

<p/>Mrs. Pullet sat down, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) mantle carefully behind, before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) answered,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>unconsciously using an impressive figure of rhetoric.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't the glass this time, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>thought Mrs. Tulliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Died the day before yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Pullet; <div class="bookquote">``an' her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) legs
was as thick as my body,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>' she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) added, with deep sadness, after a
pause. <div class="bookquote">``They'd tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) no end o' times, and the water--they say you
might ha' swum in it, if you'd liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Sophy, it's a mercy she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s gone, then, whoever she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Glegg, with the promptitude and emphasis of a mind naturally
clear and decided; <div class="bookquote">``but I can't think who you're talking of, for my
part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But _I_ know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, sighing and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``and
there isn't another such a dropsy in the parish. _I_ know as it's old
Mrs. Sutton o' the Twentylands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)'s no kin o' yours, nor much acquaintance as I've ever
heared of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, who always cried just as much as was
proper when anything happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own <div class="bookquote">``kin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>but not on other
occasions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)'s so much acquaintance as I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) legs when they was like
bladders. And an old lady as had doubled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) money over and over
again, and kept it all in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own management to the last, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
pocket with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) keys in under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pillow constant. There isn't many
old _par_ish`ners like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they say she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d took as much physic as `ud fill a wagon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>observed
Mr. Pullet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Pullet, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d another complaint ever so many years
before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had the dropsy, and the doctors couldn't make out what it
was. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to me, when I went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) last Christmas, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
said, ``Mrs. Pullet, if ever you have the dropsy, you'll think o' me.<div class="bookquote">''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) _did_ say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Pullet, beginning to cry bitterly again;
<div class="bookquote">``those were her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) very words. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)'s to be buried o' Saturday, and
Pullet's bid to the funeral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, unable any longer to contain her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) spirit of
rational remonstrance,--<div class="bookquote">``Sophy, I wonder _at_ you, fretting and
injuring your health about people as don't belong to you. Your poor
father never did so, nor your aunt Frances neither, nor any o' the
family as I ever heard of. You couldn't fret no more than this, if
we'd heared as our cousin Abbott had died sudden without making his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbott</b></font>)
will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pullet was silent, having to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) crying, and rather
flattered than indignant at being upbraided for crying too much. It
was not everybody who could afford to cry so much about their
neighbors who had left them nothing; but Mrs. Pullet had married a
gentleman farmer, and had leisure and money to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) crying and
everything else to the highest pitch of respectability.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Sutton didn't die without making her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) will, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Pullet, with a confused sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) was saying something to sanction
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) wife's tears; <div class="bookquote">``ours is a rich parish, but they say there's nobody
else to leave as many thousands behind 'em as Mrs. Sutton. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)'s
left no leggicies to speak on,--left it all in a lump to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) husband's
nevvy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There wasn't much good i' being so rich, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)'d got none but husband's kin to leave it to. It's poor work when
that's all you've got to pinch yourself for. Not as I'm one o' those
as `ud like to die without leaving more money out at interest than
other folks had reckoned; but it's a poor tale when it must go out o'
your own family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, who had recovered sufficiently
to take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) veil and fold it carefully, ``it's a nice sort o' man
as Mrs. Sutton has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) money to, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s troubled with the
asthmy, and goes to bed every night at eight o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me about
it himself--as free as could be--one Sunday when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to our
church. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wears a hareskin on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest, and has a trembling in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
talk,--quite a gentleman sort o' man. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there wasn't many
months in the year as I wasn't under the doctor's hands. And he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said,
``Mrs. Pullet, I can feel for you.<div class="bookquote">'' That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) said,--the very
words. Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Pullet, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head at the idea that
there were but few who could enter fully into her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) experiences in pink
mixture and white mixture, strong stuff in small bottles, and weak
stuff in large bottles, damp boluses at a shilling, and draughts at
eighteenpence. <div class="bookquote">``Sister, I may as well go and take my bonnet off now.
Did you see as the cap-box was put out?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) added, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
husband.

<p/>Mr. Pullet, by an unaccountable lapse of memory, had forgotten it, and
hastened out, with a stricken conscience, to remedy the omission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll bring it upstairs, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, wishing to go
at once, lest Mrs. Glegg should begin to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) feelings about
Sophy's being the first Dodson who ever ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) constitution with
doctor's stuff.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister Pullet, and
looking thoroughly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) cap before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) put it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head, and
discussing millinery in general. This was part of Bessy's weakness
that stirred Mrs. Glegg's sisterly compassion: Bessy went far too well
dressed, considering; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was too proud to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) child in the
good clothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sister Glegg gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) from the primeval strata of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wardrobe; it was a sin and a shame to buy anything to dress that
child, if it wasn't a pair of shoes. In this particular, however, Mrs.
Glegg did her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sister Bessy some injustice, for Mrs. Tulliver had
really made great efforts to induce Maggie to wear a leghorn bonnet
and a dyed silk frock made out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Glegg's, but the results
had been such that Mrs. Tulliver was obliged to bury them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
maternal bosom; for Maggie, declaring that the frock smelt of nasty
dye, had taken an opportunity of basting it together with the roast
beef the first Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wore it, and finding this scheme answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
had subsequently pumped on the bonnet with its green ribbons, so as to
give it a general resemblance to a sage cheese garnished with withered
lettuces. I must urge in excuse for Maggie, that Tom had laughed at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in the bonnet, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked like an old Judy. Aunt Pullet,
too, made presents of clothes, but these were always pretty enough to
please Maggie as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother. Of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sisters, Mrs. Tulliver
certainly preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister Pullet, not without a return of
preference; but Mrs. Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty, awkward
children; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) would do the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) could by them, but it was a pity
they weren't as good and as pretty as sister Deane's child. Maggie and
Tom, on their part, thought their aunt Pullet tolerable, chiefly
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not their aunt Glegg. Tom always declined to go more
than once during his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) holidays to see either of them. Both his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncles
tipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that once, of course; but at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunt Pullet's there were a
great many toads to pelt in the cellar-area, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) preferred the
visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). Maggie shuddered at the toads, and dreamed of them
horribly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) uncle Pullet's musical snuff-box. Still,
it was agreed by the sisters, in Mrs. Tulliver's absence, that the
Tulliver blood did not mix well with the Dodson blood; that, in fact,
poor Bessy's children were Tullivers, and that Tom, notwithstanding he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had the Dodson complexion, was likely to be as <div class="bookquote">``contrairy''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodson/Miss Dodson</b></font>)</div>as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father. As for Maggie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was the picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Moss, Mr.
Tulliver's sister,--a large-boned woman, who had married as poorly as
could be; had no china, and had a husband who had much ado to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
rent. But when Mrs. Pullet was alone with Mrs. Tulliver upstairs, the
remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of Mrs. Glegg, and they
agreed, in confidence, that there was no knowing what sort of fright
sister Jane would come out next. But their _tête-à-tête_ was curtailed
by the appearance of Mrs. Deane with little Lucy; and Mrs. Tulliver
had to look on with a silent pang while Lucy's blond curls were
adjusted. It was quite unaccountable that Mrs. Deane, the thinnest and
sallowest of all the Miss Dodsons, should have had this child, who
might have been taken for Mrs. Tulliver's any day. And Maggie always
looked twice as dark as usual when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was by the side of Lucy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did to-day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and Tom came in from the garden with their
father and their uncle Glegg. Maggie had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet off very
carelessly, and coming in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair rough as well as out of curl,
rushed at once to Lucy, who was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother's knee.
Certainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous, and to
superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of Maggie though a
connoisseur might have seen <div class="bookquote">``points''  (<font color='red'><b>a connoisseur</b></font>)</div>in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) which had a higher promise
for maturity than Lucy's natty completeness. It was like the contrast
between a rough, dark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten. Lucy put up
the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed; everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was neat,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little round neck, with the row of coral beads; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
little straight nose, not at all snubby; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little clear eyebrows,
rather darker than her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) curls, to match hazel eyes, which looked up
with shy pleasure at Maggie, taller by the head, though scarcely a
year older. Maggie always looked at Lucy with delight.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger
than children of their own age, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made the queen of it just like
Lucy, with a little crown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head, and a little sceptre in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
hand--only the queen was Maggie herself in Lucy's form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) burst out, after kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you'll stay with Tom
and me, won't you? Oh, kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, too, had come up to Lucy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not going to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)--no;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with Maggie, because it seemed easier, on the whole,
than saying, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>to all those aunts and uncles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood
looking at nothing in particular, with the blushing, awkward air and
semi-smile which are common to shy boys when in company,--very much as
if they had come into the world by mistake, and found it in a degree
of undress that was quite embarrassing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heyday!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Glegg, with loud emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``Do little boys and
gells come into a room without taking notice of their uncles and
aunts? That wasn't the way when _I_ was a little gell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and speak to your aunts and uncles, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver,
looking anxious and melancholy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wanted to whisper to Maggie a
command to go and have her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair brushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how do you do? And I hope you're good children, are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Glegg, in the same loud, emphatic way, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) took their
hands, hurting them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) large rings, and kissing their cheeks
much against their desire. <div class="bookquote">``Look up, Tom, look up. Boys as go to
boarding-schools should hold their heads up. Look at me now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom
declined that pleasure apparently, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tried to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand away.
<div class="bookquote">``Put your hair behind your ears, Maggie, and keep your frock on your
shoulder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud, emphatic way, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
considered them deaf, or perhaps rather idiotic; it was a means, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
thought, of making them feel that they were accountable creatures, and
might be a salutary check on naughty tendencies. Bessy's children were
so spoiled--they'd need have somebody to make them feel their duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, in a compassionate voice, <div class="bookquote">``you
grow wonderful fast. I doubt they'll outgrow their strength,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
added, looking over their heads, with a melancholy expression, at
their mother. <div class="bookquote">``I think the gell has too much hair. I'd have it thinned
and cut shorter, sister, if I was you; it isn't good for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) health.
It's that as makes her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) skin so brown, I shouldn't wonder. Don't you
think so, sister Deane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say, I'm sure, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deane/Mrs. Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Deane, shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) lips
close again, and looking at Maggie with a critical eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``the child's healthy enough; there's
nothing ails her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). There's red wheat as well as white, for that matter,
and some like the dark grain best. But it `ud be as well if Bessy `ud
have the child's hair cut, so as it `ud lie smooth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>A dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie's breast, but it was
arrested by the desire to know from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Deane whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would
leave Lucy behind. Aunt Deane would hardly ever let Lucy come to see
them. After various reasons for refusal, Mrs. Deane appealed to Lucy
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't like to stay behind without mother, should you, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, timidly, blushing very pink all over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Lucy! Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stay, Mrs. Deane, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Deane, a large but alert-looking man, with a type of _physique_ to be
seen in all ranks of English society,--bald crown, red whiskers, full
forehead, and general solidity without heaviness. You may see noblemen
like Mr. Deane, and you may see grocers or day-laborers like him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>); but
the keenness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) brown eyes was less common than his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) contour.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) held a silver snuff-box very tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) hand, and now and then
exchanged a pinch with Mr. Tulliver, whose box was only
silver-mounted, so that it was naturally a joke between them that Mr.
Tulliver wanted to exchange snuff-boxes also. Mr. Deane's box had been
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) by the superior partners in the firm to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) belonged,
at the same time that they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) a share in the business, in
acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) valuable services as manager. No man was thought
more highly of in St. Ogg's than Mr. Deane; and some persons were even
of opinion that Miss Susan Dodson, who was once held to have made the
worst match of all the Dodson sisters, might one day ride in a better
carriage, and live in a better house, even than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) sister Pullet.
There was no knowing where a man would stop, who had got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot into
a great mill-owning, shipowning business like that of Guest & Co.,
with a banking concern attached. And Mrs. Deane, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) intimate
female friends observed, was proud and <div class="bookquote">``having''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>enough; _she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)_ wouldn't
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) husband stand still in the world for want of spurring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, beckoning Maggie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and whispering
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) ear, as soon as this point of Lucy's staying was settled, <div class="bookquote">``go
and get your hair brushed, do, for shame. I told you not to come in
without going to Martha first, you know I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom come out with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>whispered Maggie, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sleeve as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
passed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and Tom followed willingly enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come upstairs with me, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whispered, when they were outside
the door. <div class="bookquote">``There's something I want to do before dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no time to play at anything before dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, whose
imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, there is time for this; _do_ come, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom followed Maggie upstairs into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's room, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) go at
once to a drawer, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took out a large pair of scissors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they for, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) curiosity awakened.

<p/>Maggie answered by seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) front locks and cutting them straight
across the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my buttons! Maggie, you'll catch it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Tom; <div class="bookquote">``you'd
better not cut any more off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Snip! went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
couldn't help feeling it was rather good fun; Maggie would look so
queer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Tom, cut it behind for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
daring, and anxious to finish the deed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll catch it, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head in an
admonitory manner, and hesitating a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took the scissors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, make haste!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, giving a little stamp with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
foot. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheeks were quite flushed.

<p/>The black locks were so thick, nothing could be more tempting to a lad
who had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony's
mane. I speak to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of
scissors meet through a duly resisting mass of hair. One delicious
grinding snip, and then another and another, and the hinder-locks fell
heavily on the floor, and Maggie stood cropped in a jagged, uneven
manner, but with a sense of clearness and freedom, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
emerged from a wood into the open plain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, jumping round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my buttons! what a queer thing you look! Look at
yourself in the glass; you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells
to at school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie felt an unexpected pang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had thought beforehand chiefly at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own deliverance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) teasing hair and teasing remarks about
it, and something also of the triumph she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunts by this very decided course of action; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't want
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair to look pretty,--that was out of the question,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) only
wanted people to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a clever little girl, and not to find fault
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But now, when Tom began to laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and say she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
like an idiot, the affair had quite a new aspect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked in the
glass, and still Tom laughed and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, and Maggie's
cheeks began to pale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips to tremble a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Maggie, you'll have to go down to dinner directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, my!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't laugh at me, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a passionate tone, with an
outburst of angry tears, stamping, and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a push.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, spitfire!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``What did you cut it off for, then? I
shall go down: I can smell the dinner going in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hurried downstairs and left poor Maggie to that bitter sense of the
irrevocable which was almost an every-day experience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) small
soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could see clearly enough, now the thing was done, that it
was very foolish, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have to hear and think more
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair than ever; for Maggie rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deeds with
passionate impulse, and then saw not only their consequences, but what
would have happened if they had not been done, with all the detail and
exaggerated circumstance of an active imagination. Tom never did the
same sort of foolish things as Maggie, having a wonderful instinctive
discernment of what would turn to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) advantage or disadvantage; and
so it happened, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was much more wilful and inflexible
than Maggie, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother hardly ever called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) naughty. But if Tom did
make a mistake of that sort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) espoused it, and stood by it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``didn't mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) broke the lash of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's gigwhip by lashing
the gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't help it,--the whip shouldn't have got caught in
the hinge. If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was convinced, not that
the whipping of gates by all boys was a justifiable act, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>),
Tom Tulliver, was justifiable in whipping that particular gate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
wasn't going to be sorry. But Maggie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood crying before the
glass, felt it impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should go down to dinner and endure
the severe eyes and severe words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and
Martha, who waited at table, and perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) father and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) uncles,
would laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>); for if Tom had laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), of course every one
else would; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had only let her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hair alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could have sat
with Tom and Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard! What
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) do but sob? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sat as helpless and despairing among her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
black locks as Ajax among the slaughtered sheep. Very trivial,
perhaps, this anguish seems to weather-worn mortals who have to think
of Christmas bills, dead loves, and broken friendships; but it was not
less bitter to Maggie--perhaps it was even more bitter--than what we
are fond of calling antithetically the real troubles of mature life.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, my child, you will have real troubles to fret about by and by,''
 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>is the consolation we have almost all of us had administered to us in
our childhood, and have repeated to other children since we have been
grown up. We have all of us sobbed so piteously, standing with tiny
bare legs above our little socks, when we lost sight of our mother or
nurse in some strange place; but we can no longer recall the poignancy
of that moment and weep over it, as we do over the remembered
sufferings of five or ten years ago. Every one of those keen moments
has left its trace, and lives in us still, but such traces have blent
themselves irrecoverably with the firmer texture of our youth and
manhood; and so it comes that we can look on at the troubles of our
children with a smiling disbelief in the reality of their pain. Is
there any one who can recover the experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) childhood, not
merely with a memory _of_ what he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) did and what happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) liked and disliked when he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) was in frock and trousers, but with
an intimate penetration, a revived consciousness of what he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) felt then,
when it was so long from one Midsummer to another; what he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) felt when
his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) school fellows shut him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) out of their game because he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) would pitch
the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness; or on a rainy day in the
holidays, when he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) didn't know how to amuse himself, and fell from
idleness into mischief, from mischief into defiance, and from defiance
into sulkiness; or when his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) mother absolutely refused to let him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) have
a tailed coat that <div class="bookquote">``half,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>although every other boy of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age had
gone into tails already? Surely if we could recall that early
bitterness, and the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless
conception of life, that gave the bitterness its intensity, we should
not pooh-pooh the griefs of our children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Maggie, you're to come down this minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kezia</b></font>)</div>said Kezia, entering
the room hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``Lawks! what have you been a-doing? I never _see_
such a fright!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, Kezia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Go away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I tell you you're to come down, Miss, this minute; your mother
says so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kezia</b></font>)</div>said Kezia, going up to Maggie and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by the hand to
raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get away, Kezia; I don't want any dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, resisting
Kezia's arm. <div class="bookquote">``I sha'n't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, I can't stay. I've got to wait at dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kezia</b></font>)</div>said Kezia,
going out again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, you little silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, peeping into the room ten
minutes after, <div class="bookquote">``why don't you come and have your dinner? There's lots
o' goodies, and mother says you're to come. What are you crying for,
you little spooney?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, it was dreadful! Tom was so hard and unconcerned; if _he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_ had been
crying on the floor, Maggie would have cried too. And there was the
dinner, so nice; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was _so_ hungry. It was very bitter.

<p/>But Tom was not altogether hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not inclined to cry, and did
not feel that Maggie's grief spoiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prospect of the sweets; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head near her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and said in a lower, comforting
tone,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you come, then, Magsie? Shall I bring you a bit o' pudding when
I've had mine, and a custard and things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-e-es,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, beginning to feel life a little more
tolerable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, going away. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned again at the door and
said, <div class="bookquote">``But you'd better come, you know. There's the dessert,--nuts,
you know, and cowslip wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's tears had ceased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked reflective as Tom left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) suffering, and
nuts with cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence.

<p/>Slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rose from amongst her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) scattered locks, and slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way downstairs. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood leaning with one shoulder against
the frame of the dining-parlour door, peeping in when it was ajar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
saw Tom and Lucy with an empty chair between them, and there were the
custards on a side-table; it was too much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) slipped in and went
toward the empty chair. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no sooner sat down than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
repented and wished herself back again.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver gave a little scream as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and felt such a
<div class="bookquote">``turn''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) dropped the large gravy-spoon into the dish, with the
most serious results to the table-cloth. For Kezia had not betrayed
the reason of Maggie's refusal to come down, not liking to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mistress a shock in the moment of carving, and Mrs. Tulliver thought
there was nothing worse in question than a fit of perverseness, which
was inflicting its own punishment by depriving Maggie of half her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
dinner.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver's scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own, and Maggie's cheeks and ears began to burn, while uncle
Glegg, a kind-looking, white-haired old gentleman, said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heyday! what little gell's this? Why, I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Is it some
little gell you've picked up in the road, Kezia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s gone and cut her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hair herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver in an
undertone to Mr. Deane, laughing with much enjoyment. Did you ever
know such a little hussy as it is?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, little miss, you've made yourself look very funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle
Pullet, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) life made an observation which was
felt to be so lacerating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, for shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Glegg, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) loudest, severest tone of
reproof. <div class="bookquote">``Little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed
on bread and water,--not come and sit down with their aunts and
uncles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Glegg, meaning to give a playful turn to this
denunciation, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must be sent to jail, I think, and they'll cut the
rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hair off there, and make it all even.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s more like a gypsy nor ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, in a pitying
tone; <div class="bookquote">``it's very bad luck, sister, as the gell should be so brown; the
boy's fair enough. I doubt it'll stand in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) way i' life to be so
brown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s a naughty child, as'll break her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother's heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver, with the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Maggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) first flush came from anger, which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a transient power of
defiance, and Tom thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was braving it out, supported by the
recent appearance of the pudding and custard. Under this impression,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my! Maggie, I told you you'd catch it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meant to
be friendly, but Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
ignominy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feeble power of defiance left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in an instant, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
heart swelled, and getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father,
hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shoulder, and burst out into loud sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, my wench,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, soothingly, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``never mind; you was i' the right to cut it off if it
plagued you; give over crying; father'll take your part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Delicious words of tenderness! Maggie never forgot any of these
moments when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father <div class="bookquote">``took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part'' (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart,
and thought of them long years after, when every one else said that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had done very ill by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How your husband does spoil that child, Bessy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, in a
loud <div class="bookquote">``aside,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>to Mrs. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``It'll be the ruin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), if you
don't take care. _My_ father never brought his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children up so, else we
should ha' been a different sort o' family to what we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver's domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached
the point at which insensibility begins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
sister's remark, but threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) capstrings and dispensed the
pudding, in mute resignation.

<p/>With the dessert there came entire deliverance for Maggie, for the
children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the
summer-house, since the day was so mild; and they scampered out among
the budding bushes of the garden with the alacrity of small animals
getting from under a burning glass.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver had her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) special reason for this permission: now the
dinner was despatched, and every one's mind disengaged, it was the
right moment to communicate Mr. Tulliver's intention concerning Tom,
and it would be as well for Tom himself to be absent. The children
were used to hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were
birds, and could understand nothing, however they might stretch their
necks and listen; but on this occasion Mrs. Tulliver manifested an
unusual discretion, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had recently had evidence that the
going to school to a clergyman was a sore point with Tom, who looked
at it as very much on a par with going to school to a constable. Mrs.
Tulliver had a sighing sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband would do as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) liked,
whatever sister Glegg said, or sister Pullet either; but at least they
would not be able to say, if the thing turned out ill, that Bessy had
fallen in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) husband's folly without letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own friends
know a word about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) husband in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) talk with
Mr. Deane, <div class="bookquote">``it's time now to tell the children's aunts and uncles what
you're thinking of doing with Tom, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, rather sharply, <div class="bookquote">``I've no objections to
tell anybody what I mean to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). I've settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) added,
looking toward Mr. Glegg and Mr. Deane,--<div class="bookquote">``I've settled to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to
a Mr. Stelling, a parson, down at King's Lorton, there,--an uncommon
clever fellow, I understand, as'll put him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up to most things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company, such as
you may have observed in a country congregation when they hear an
allusion to their week-day affairs from the pulpit. It was equally
astonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into
Mr. Tulliver's family arrangements. As for uncle Pullet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) could
hardly have been more thoroughly obfuscated if Mr. Tulliver had said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was going to send Tom to the Lord Chancellor; for uncle Pullet
belonged to that extinct class of British yeoman who, dressed in good
broadcloth, paid high rates and taxes, went to church, and ate a
particularly good dinner on Sunday, without dreaming that the British
constitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than
the solar system and the fixed stars.

<p/>It is melancholy, but true, that Mr. Pullet had the most confused idea
of a bishop as a sort of a baronet, who might or might not be a
clergyman; and as the rector of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) own parish was a man of high
family and fortune, the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster
was too remote from Mr. Pullet's experience to be readily conceivable.
I know it is difficult for people in these instructed times to believe
in uncle Pullet's ignorance; but let them reflect on the remarkable
results of a great natural faculty under favoring circumstances. And
uncle Pullet had a great natural faculty for ignorance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) was the
first to give utterance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what can you be going to send him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to a parson for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) said,
with an amazed twinkling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) eyes, looking at Mr. Glegg and Mr.
Deane, to see if they showed any signs of comprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, because the parsons are the best schoolmasters, by what I can
make out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mr. Tulliver, who, in the maze of this puzzling
world, laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity.
<div class="bookquote">``Jacobs at th' academy's no parson, and he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)'s done very bad by the boy;
and I made up my mind, if I send him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) to school again, it should be to
somebody different to Jacobs. And this Mr. Stelling, by what I can
make out, is the sort o' man I want. And I mean my boy to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at
Midsummer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) concluded, in a tone of decision, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) snuff-box
and taking a pinch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to pay a swinging half-yearly bill, then, eh, Tulliver?
The clergymen have highish notions, in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane,
taking snuff vigorously, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) always did when wishing to maintain a
neutral position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! do you think the parson'll teach him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) to know a good sample o'
wheat when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) sees it, neighbor Tulliver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, who was
fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) jest, and having retired from business, felt that it was
not only allowable but becoming in him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) to take a playful view of
things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, I've got a plan i' my head about Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Tulliver, pausing after that statement and lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if I may be allowed to speak, and it's seldom as I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Glegg, with a tone of bitter meaning, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know what
good is to come to the boy by bringin' him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up above his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fortin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, not looking at Mrs. Glegg, but at the male
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) audience, <div class="bookquote">``you see, I've made up my mind not to bring Tom
up to my own business. I've had my thoughts about it all along, and I
made up my mind by what I saw with Garnett and _his (<font color='blue'><b>Garnett</b></font>)_ son. I mean to
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Garnett</b></font>) to some business as he (<font color='blue'><b>Garnett</b></font>) can go into without capital, and I want
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Garnett</b></font>) an eddication as he (<font color='blue'><b>Garnett</b></font>)'ll be even wi' the lawyers and folks,
and put me up to a notion now an' then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>audience</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips,
that smiled in mingled pity and scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It `ud be a fine deal better for some people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, after that
introductory note, <div class="bookquote">``if they'd let the lawyers alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Garnett</b></font>) at the head of a grammar school, then, this clergyman, such as
that at Market Bewley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) won't take more than two
or three pupils, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)'ll have the more time to attend to 'em, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, and get his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) eddication done the sooner; they can't learn much at
a time when there's so many of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Pullet, feeling that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was getting quite an insight into this difficult matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)'ll want the more pay, I doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, a cool hundred a year, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, with
some pride at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own spirited course. <div class="bookquote">``But then, you know, it's an
investment; Tom's eddication `ull be so much capital to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, there's something in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg. ``Well well, neighbor
Tulliver, you may be right, you may be right:

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton. But us
that have got no learning had better keep our money, eh, neighbor
Pullet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>Mr. Glegg rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) knees, and looked very pleasant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg, I wonder _at_ you,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``It's very unbecoming
in a man o' your age and belongings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's unbecoming, Mrs. G.?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, winking pleasantly at
the company. <div class="bookquote">``My new blue coat as I've got on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I pity your weakness, Mr. Glegg. I say it's unbecoming to be making a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean me by that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, considerably nettled,
<div class="bookquote">``you needn't trouble yourself to fret about me. I can manage my own
affairs without troubling other folks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, judiciously introducing a new idea, <div class="bookquote">``why,
now I come to think of it, somebody said Wakem was going to send _his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)_

to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) wife-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give no account of it, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deane/Mrs. Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Deane, closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
lips very tightly again. Mrs. Deane was not a woman to take part in a
scene where missiles were flying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, speaking all the more cheerfully, that Mrs.

as if the whole business had a funereal aspect; <div class="bookquote">``it's more nat`ral to

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, interpreting Mrs. Pullet's observation with
erroneous plausibility, <div class="bookquote">``you must consider that, neighbor Tulliver;

keep it corked up, <div class="bookquote">``you'd far better hold your tongue. Mr. Tulliver

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, beginning to boil up again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, _I_ say nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, sarcastically. <div class="bookquote">``My advice has
never been asked, and I don't give it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be the first time, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``It's the only

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been over-ready at lending, then, if I haven't been over-ready

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, soothingly. But Mr. Tulliver was
not to be hindered of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) retort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got a bond for it, I reckon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and you've had your
five per cent, kin or no kin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, pleadingly, <div class="bookquote">``drink your wine, and let me

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bessy, I'm sorry for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, very much with the
feeling of a cur that seizes the opportunity of diverting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) bark
toward the man who carries no stick. <div class="bookquote">``It's poor work talking o'
almonds and raisins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lors, sister Glegg, don't be so quarrelsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet,
beginning to cry a little. <div class="bookquote">``You may be struck with a fit, getting so
red in the face after dinner, and we are but just out o' mourning, all
of us,--and all wi' gowns craped alike and just put by; it's very bad
among sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it _is_ bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``Things are come to a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly, softly, Jane; be reasonable, be reasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg.

<p/>But while he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was speaking, Mr. Tulliver, who had by no means said
enough to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) anger, burst out again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who wants to quarrel with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's you as can't let

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My place, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, getting rather more shrill.
<div class="bookquote">``There's your betters, Mr. Tulliver, as are dead and in their grave,

worse than they might ha' done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you talk o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``my family's as good as

it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether
you think it's a fine thing to sit by and hear me swore at, Mr. Glegg;
but I'm not going to stay a minute longer in this house. You can stay
behind, and come home with the gig, and I'll walk home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart, dear heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg in a melancholy tone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulliver, how could you talk so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, with the
tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, too hot to be damped by any amount of
tears. <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go, and the sooner the better; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't be trying to
domineer over _me_ again in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister Pullet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, helplessly, <div class="bookquote">``do you think it `ud
be any use for you to go after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) and try to pacify her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better not, better not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane. <div class="bookquote">``You'll make it up another
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, sisters, shall we go and look at the children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver, drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>No proposition could have been more seasonable. Mr. Tulliver felt very
much as if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women
were out of the room. There were few things he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) liked better than a
chat with Mr. Deane, whose close application to business allowed the
pleasure very rarely. Mr. Deane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) considered, was the <div class="bookquote">``knowingest''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>man of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) acquaintance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had besides a ready causticity of
tongue that made an agreeable supplement to Mr. Tulliver's own
tendency that way, which had remained in rather an inarticulate
condition. And now the women were gone, they could carry on their
serious talk without frivolous interruption. They could exchange their
views concerning the Duke of Wellington, whose conduct in the Catholic
Question had thrown such an entirely new light on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) character; and
speak slightingly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) conduct at the battle of Waterloo, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
would never have won if there hadn't been a great many Englishmen at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) back, not to speak of Blucher and the Prussians, who, as Mr.
Tulliver had heard from a person of particular knowledge in that
matter, had come up in the very nick of time; though here there was a
slight dissidence, Mr. Deane remarking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) was not disposed to
give much credit to the Prussians,--the build of their vessels,
together with the unsatisfactory character of transactions in Dantzic
beer, inclining him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to form rather a low view of Prussian pluck
generally. Rather beaten on this ground, Mr. Tulliver proceeded to
express his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) fears that the country could never again be what it used
to be; but Mr. Deane, attached to a firm of which the returns were on
the increase, naturally took a more lively view of the present, and
had some details to give concerning the state of the imports,
especially in hides and spelter, which soothed Mr. Tulliver's
imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when
the country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals, and
there would be no more chance for honest men.

<p/>Uncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high
matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) didn't understand politics himself,--thought they were a
natural gift,--but by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) could make out, this Duke of Wellington
was no better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) should be.



<p/>Chapter VIII

<p/>Mr. Tulliver Shows His (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) Weaker Side


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose sister Glegg should call her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) money in; it `ud be very awkward
for you to have to raise five hundred pounds now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband that evening, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) took a plaintive review of the
day.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
retained in all the freshness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) early married life a facility of
saying things which drove him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the opposite direction to the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
desired. Some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way,
as a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful
illusion that it can swim in a straight line beyond the encircling
glass. Mrs. Tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind, and after
running her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years
would go at it again to-day with undulled alacrity.

<p/>This observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr. Tulliver that
it would not be at all awkward for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to raise five hundred pounds;
and when Mrs. Tulliver became rather pressing to know _how_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would
raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) never _would_ mortgage, since nowadays people were none so ready to
lend money without security, Mr. Tulliver, getting warm, declared that
Mrs. Glegg might do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) liked about calling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should
pay it in whether or not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not going to be beholden to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
wife's sisters. When a man had married into a family where there was a
whole litter of women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) might have plenty to put up with if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
chose. But Mr. Tulliver did _not_ choose.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver cried a little in a trickling, quiet way as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) put on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) nightcap; but presently sank into a comfortable sleep, lulled by
the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would talk everything over with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister Pullet
to-morrow, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea. Not
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk; but it
seemed impossible that past events should be so obstinate as to remain
unmodified when they were complained against.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband lay awake rather longer, for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too was thinking of a
visit he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would pay on the morrow; and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ideas on the subject were
not of so vague and soothing a kind as those of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) amiable partner.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver, when under the influence of a strong feeling, had a
promptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful
sense of the complicated, puzzling nature of human affairs under which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) more dispassionate deliberations were conducted; but it is really
not improbable that there was a direct relation between these
apparently contradictory phenomena, since I have observed that for
getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing
like snatching hastily at a single thread. It was owing to this
promptitude that Mr. Tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the
next day -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not dyspeptic-RRB- on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) way to Basset to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister
Moss and her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) husband. For having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind irrevocably that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
would pay Mrs. Glegg her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) loan of five hundred pounds, it naturally
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had a promissory note for three hundred pounds
lent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) brother-in-law Moss; and if the said brother-in-law could
manage to pay in the money within a given time, it would go far to
lessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which Mr. Tulliver's
spirited step might have worn in the eyes of weak people who require
to know precisely _how_ a thing is to be done before they are strongly
confident that it will be easy.

<p/>For Mr. Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking, but, like
other every-day things, sure to have a cumulative effect that will be
felt in the long run: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was held to be a much more substantial man
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) really was. And as we are all apt to believe what the world
believes about us, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) habit to think of failure and ruin with
the same sort of remote pity with which a spare, long-necked man hears
that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plethoric short-necked neighbor is stricken with apoplexy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advantages as a
man who worked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mill, and owned a pretty bit of land; and these
jokes naturally kept up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man of considerable
substance. They gave a pleasant flavor to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass on a market-day,
and if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments, Mr.
Tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two
thousand pounds on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) very desirable freehold. That was not
altogether his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
sister's fortune, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had to pay on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) marriage; and a man who
has neighbors that _will_ go to law with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not likely to pay off
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mortgages, especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoys the good opinion of
acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too
lofty to be represented by parchment. Our friend Mr. Tulliver had a
good-natured fibre in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and did not like to give harsh refusals
even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister, who had not only come in to the world in that
superfluous way characteristic of sisters, creating a necessity for
mortgages, but had quite thrown herself away in marriage, and had
crowned her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mistakes by having an eighth baby. On this point Mr.
Tulliver was conscious of being a little weak; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) apologized to
himself by saying that poor Gritty had been a good-looking wench
before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) married Moss; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would sometimes say this even with a
slight tremulousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) voice. But this morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was in a mood
more becoming a man of business, and in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ride along
the Basset lanes, with their deep ruts,--lying so far away from a
market-town that the labor of drawing produce and manure was enough to
take away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that
parish was made of,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up a due amount of irritation against Moss
as a man without capital, who, if murrain and blight were abroad, was
sure to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) share of them, and who, the more you tried to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the mud, would sink the further in. It would do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good
rather than harm, now, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were obliged to raise this three hundred
pounds; it would make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better, and not act so
foolishly about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wool this year as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did the last; in fact, Mr.
Tulliver had been too easy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) brother-in-law, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
let the interest run on for two years, Moss was likely enough to think
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should never be troubled about the principal. But Mr. Tulliver
was determined not to encourage such shuffling people any longer; and
a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to enervate a man's
resolution by softening his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper. The deep-trodden hoof-marks, made
in the muddiest days of winter, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a shake now and then which
suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers, who,
whether by means of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hoof or otherwise, had doubtless something to
do with this state of the roads; and the abundance of foul land and
neglected fences that met his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eye, though they made no part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
brother Moss's farm, strongly contributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dissatisfaction with
that unlucky agriculturist. If this wasn't Moss's fallow, it might
have been; Basset was all alike; it was a beggarly parish, in Mr.
Tulliver's opinion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) opinion was certainly not groundless.
Basset had a poor soil, poor roads, a poor non-resident landlord, a
poor non-resident vicar, and rather less than half a curate, also
poor. If any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind
to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of
Basset might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people, I
have nothing to urge against that abstract proposition; I only know
that, in point of fact, the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its
circumstances. The muddy lanes, green or clayey, that seemed to the
unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other, did really lead,
with patience, to a distant high-road; but there were many feet in
Basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation,
spoken of formerly as the <div class="bookquote">``Markis o' Granby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Basset</b></font>)</div>but among intimates as
<div class="bookquote">``Dickison's.''  (<font color='red'><b>intimates</b></font>)</div>A large low room with a sanded floor; a cold scent of
tobacco, modified by undetected beer-dregs; Mr. Dickison leaning
against the door-post with a melancholy pimpled face, looking as
irrelevant to the daylight as a last night's guttered candle,--all
this may not seem a very seductive form of temptation; but the
majority of men in Basset found it fatally alluring when encountered
on their road toward four o'clock on a wintry afternoon; and if any
wife in Basset wished to indicate that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband was not a
pleasure-seeking man, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could hardly do it more emphatically than by
saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't spend a shilling at Dickison's from one
Whitsuntide to another. Mrs. Moss had said so of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)_ husband more
than once, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother was in a mood to find fault with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) certainly was to-day. And nothing could be less pacifying to Mr.
Tulliver than the behavior of the farmyard gate, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) no sooner
attempted to push open with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) riding-stick than it acted as gates
without the upper hinge are known to do, to the peril of shins,
whether equine or human. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was about to get down and lead his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse
through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard, shadowed drearily by the
large half-timbered buildings, up to the long line of tumble-down
dwelling-houses standing on a raised causeway; but the timely
appearance of a cowboy saved him (<font color='blue'><b>cowboy</b></font>) that frustration of a plan he (<font color='blue'><b>cowboy</b></font>) had
determined on,--namely, not to get down from his (<font color='blue'><b>cowboy</b></font>) horse during this
visit. If a man means to be hard, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keep in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saddle and speak
from that height, above the level of pleading eyes, and with the
command of a distant horizon. Mrs. Moss heard the sound of the horse's
feet, and, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother rode up, was already outside the kitchen
door, with a half-weary smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) face, and a black-eyed baby in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) arms. Mrs. Moss's face bore a faded resemblance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother's;
baby's little fat hand, pressed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) cheek, seemed to show more
strikingly that the cheek was faded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother, I'm glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) said, in an affectionate tone. <div class="bookquote">``I
didn't look for you to-day. How do you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pretty well, Mrs. Moss, pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>answered the brother, with
cool deliberation, as if it were rather too forward of her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) to ask that
question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) knew at once that her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother was not in a good humor;
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never called her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) Mrs. Moss except when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was angry, and when they
were in company. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) thought it was in the order of nature that
people who were poorly off should be snubbed. Mrs. Moss did not take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) stand on the equality of the human race; she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) was a patient,
prolific, loving-hearted woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your husband isn't in the house, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Tulliver after
a grave pause, during which four children had run out, like chickens
whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hen-coop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s only in the potato-field yonders.
Georgy, run to the Far Close in a minute, and tell father your uncle's
come. You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I can't get down. I must be going home again directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Tulliver, looking at the distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how's Mrs. Tulliver and the children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, humbly,
not daring to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) invitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pretty well. Tom's going to a new school at Midsummer,--a deal of
expense to me. It's bad work for me, lying out o' my money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd be so good as let the children come and see their
cousins some day. My little uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as
never was. And me her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) godmother, and so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); there's nobody
`ud make a bigger fuss with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), according to what they've got. And I
know she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) likes to come, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s a loving child, and how quick and
clever she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is, to be sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/>If Mrs. Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world,
instead of being one of the simplest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) could have thought of
nothing more likely to propitiate her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother than this praise of
Maggie. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seldom found any one volunteering praise of <div class="bookquote">``the little
wench'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; it was usually left entirely to himself to insist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)
merits. But Maggie always appeared in the most amiable light at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
aunt Moss's; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) Alsatia, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) was out of the reach of
law,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) upset anything, dirtied her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) shoes, or tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) frock,
these things were matters of course at her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) aunt Moss's. In spite of
himself, Mr. Tulliver's eyes got milder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) did not look away from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s fonder o' you than o' the other aunts, I think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) takes
after our family: not a bit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Moss says she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)'s just like what I used to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, <div class="bookquote">``though
I was never so quick and fond o' the books. But I think my Lizzy's
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>); _she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)'s_ sharp. Come here, Lizzy, my dear, and let your uncle
see you; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hardly knows you, you grow so fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/>Lizzy, a black-eyed child of seven, looked very shy when her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) mother
drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) forward, for the small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle
from Dorlcote Mill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) was inferior enough to Maggie in fire and
strength of expression to make the resemblance between the two
entirely flattering to Mr. Tulliver's fatherly love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, they're a bit alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, looking kindly at the little
figure in the soiled pinafore. <div class="bookquote">``They both take after our mother.
You've got enough o' gells, Gritty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) added, in a tone half
compassionate, half reproachful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four of 'em, bless 'em!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, with a sigh, stroking
Lizzy's hair on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) forehead; <div class="bookquote">``as many as there's boys.
They've got a brother apiece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but they must turn out and fend for themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Tulliver, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) severity was relaxing and trying to brace
it by throwing out a wholesome hint <div class="bookquote">``They mustn't look to hanging on
their brothers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I hope their brothers `ull love the poor things, and remember
they came o' one father and mother; the lads `ull never be the poorer
for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, flashing out with hurried timidity, like a
half-smothered fire.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse a little stroke on the flank, then checked
it, and said angrily, <div class="bookquote">``Stand still with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>much to the astonishment
of that innocent animal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the more there is of 'em, the more they must love one another,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Moss went on, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) children with a didactic purpose.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother again to say, <div class="bookquote">``Not but what I hope
your boy `ull allays be good to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister, though there's but two of
'em, like you and me, brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>The arrow went straight to Mr. Tulliver's heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had not a rapid
imagination, but the thought of Maggie was very near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
was not long in seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own sister side by side
with Tom's relation to Maggie. Would the little wench ever be poorly
off, and Tom rather hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, Gritty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, with a new softness in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) tone;
<div class="bookquote">``but I've allays done what I could for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) added, as if
vindicating himself from a reproach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not denying that, brother, and I'm noways ungrateful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said poor
Mrs. Moss, too fagged by toil and children to have strength left for
any pride. <div class="bookquote">``But here's the father. What a while you've been, Moss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``While, do you call it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Moss, feeling out of breath and
injured. <div class="bookquote">``I've been running all the way. Won't you `light, Mr.
Tulliver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll just get down and have a bit o' talk with you in the
garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should be more likely to
show a due spirit of resolve if his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister were not present.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) got down, and passed with Mr. Moss into the garden, toward an old
yew-tree arbor, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) sister stood tapping her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) baby on the back
and looking wistfully after them.

<p/>Their entrance into the yew-tree arbor surprised several fowls that
were recreating themselves by scratching deep holes in the dusty
ground, and at once took flight with much pother and cackling. Mr.
Tulliver sat down on the bench, and tapping the ground curiously here
and there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) stick, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) suspected some hollowness, opened
the conversation by observing, with something like a snarl in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
tone,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you've got wheat again in that Corner Close, I see; and never a
bit o' dressing on it. You'll do no good with it this year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Moss, who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) married Miss Tulliver, had been regarded as the
buck of Basset, now wore a beard nearly a week old, and had the
depressed, unexpectant air of a machine-horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) answered in a
patient-grumbling tone, <div class="bookquote">``Why, poor farmers like me must do as they
can; they must leave it to them as have got money to play with, to put
half as much into the ground as they mean to get out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know who should have money to play with, if it isn't them as
can borrow money without paying interest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, who
wished to get into a slight quarrel; it was the most natural and easy
introduction to calling in money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I'm behind with the interest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Moss, <div class="bookquote">``but I was so
unlucky wi' the wool last year; and what with the Missis being laid up
so, things have gone awk`arder nor usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Moss</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>snarled Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``there's folks as things `ull allays go
awk`ard with; empty sacks `ull never stand upright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know what fault you've got to find wi' me, Mr.
Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Moss, deprecatingly; <div class="bookquote">``I know there isn't a
day-laborer works harder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Moss</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, sharply, <div class="bookquote">``when a man
marries, and's got no capital to work his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farm but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's bit o'
fortin? I was against it from the first; but you'd neither of you
listen to me. And I can't lie out o' my money any longer, for I've got
to pay five hundred o' Mrs. Glegg's, and there'll be Tom an expense to
me. I should find myself short, even saying I'd got back all as is my
own. You must look about and see how you can pay me the three hundred
pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if that's what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Moss, looking blankly before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we'd better be sold up, and ha' done with it; I must part wi'
every head o' stock I've got, to pay you and the landlord too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor relations are undeniably irritating,--their existence is so
entirely uncalled for on our part, and they are almost always very
faulty people. Mr. Tulliver had succeeded in getting quite as much
irritated with Mr. Moss as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) had desired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) was able to say
angrily, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) seat,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you must do as you can. _I_ can't find money for everybody else
as well as myself. I must look to my own business and my own family. I
can't lie out o' my money any longer. You must raise it as quick as
you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) uttered the last
sentence, and, without looking round at Mr. Moss, went on to the
kitchen door, where the eldest boy was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) horse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
sister was waiting in a state of wondering alarm, which was not
without its alleviations, for baby was making pleasant gurgling
sounds, and performing a great deal of finger practice on the faded
face. Mrs. Moss had eight children, but could never overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)
regret that the twins had not lived. Mr. Moss thought their removal
was not without its consolations. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you come in, brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)
said, looking anxiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) husband, who was walking slowly up,
while Mr. Tulliver had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) foot already in the stirrup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; good-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse's head, and riding away.

<p/>No man could feel more resolute till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got outside the yard gate, and
a little way along the deep-rutted lane; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the
next turning, which would take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of sight of the dilapidated
farm-buildings, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be smitten by some sudden thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
checked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse, and made it stand still in the same spot for two or
three minutes, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head from side to side in a
melancholy way, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were looking at some painful object on more
sides than one. Evidently, after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fit of promptitude, Mr. Tulliver
was relapsing into the sense that this is a puzzling world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse, and rode slowly back, giving vent to the climax of feeling
which had determined this movement by saying aloud, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
horse, <div class="bookquote">``Poor little wench! she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll have nobody but Tom, belike, when
I'm gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver's return into the yard was descried by several young
Mosses, who immediately ran in with the exciting news to their mother,
so that Mrs. Moss was again on the door-step when her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother rode up.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) had been crying, but was rocking baby to sleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) arms now,
and made no ostentatious show of sorrow as her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>),
but merely said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The father's gone to the field, again, if you want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Gritty, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, in a gentle tone. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you
fret,--that's all,--I'll make a shift without the money a bit, only
you must be as clever and contriving as you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Moss's tears came again at this unexpected kindness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)
could say nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come!--the little wench shall come and see you. I'll bring her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
and Tom some day before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) goes to school. You mustn't fret. I'll
allays be a good brother to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for that word, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) tears;
then turning to Lizzy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Run now, and fetch the colored egg
for cousin Maggie.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Lizzy ran in, and quickly reappeared with a small
paper parcel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's boiled hard, brother, and colored with thrums, very pretty; it
was done o' purpose for Maggie. Will you please to carry it in your
pocket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, putting it carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) side pocket.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>And so the respectable miller returned along the Basset lanes rather
more puzzled than before as to ways and means, but still with the
sense of a danger escaped. It had come across his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) were
hard upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister, it might somehow tend to make Tom hard upon
Maggie at some distant day, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father was no longer there to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part; for simple people, like our friend Mr. Tulliver, are
apt to clothe unimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas, and this was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) confused way of explaining to himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) love and anxiety
for <div class="bookquote">``the little wench''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) a new sensibility toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
sister.



<p/>Chapter IX

<p/>To Garum Firs


<p/>While the possible troubles of Maggie's future were occupying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father's mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself was tasting only the bitterness of the
present. Childhood has no forebodings; but then, it is soothed by no
memories of outlived sorrow.

<p/>The fact was, the day had begun ill with Maggie. The pleasure of
having Lucy to look at, and the prospect of the afternoon visit to
Garum Firs, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would hear uncle Pullet's musical box, had been
marred as early as eleven o'clock by the advent of the hair-dresser
from St. Ogg's, who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hair, holding up one jagged lock after
another and saying, <div class="bookquote">``See here! tut, tut, tut!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in a tone of mingled
disgust and pity, which to Maggie's imagination was equivalent to the
strongest expression of public opinion. Mr. Rappit, the hair-dresser,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) well-anointed coronal locks tending wavily upward, like the
simulated pyramid of flame on a monumental urn, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at that
moment the most formidable of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) contemporaries, into whose street at
St. Ogg's she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would carefully refrain from entering through the rest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life.

<p/>Moreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in
the Dodson family, Martha was enjoined to have Mrs. Tulliver's room
ready an hour earlier than usual, that the laying out of the best
clothes might not be deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes
the case in families of lax views, where the ribbon-strings were never
rolled up, where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper, and
where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily
produced no shock to the mind. Already, at twelve o'clock, Mrs.
Tulliver had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) visiting costume, with a protective apparatus of
brown holland, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had been a piece of satin furniture in danger
of flies; Maggie was frowning and twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shoulders, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers, while
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother was remonstrating, <div class="bookquote">``Don't, Maggie, my dear; don't make
yourself so ugly!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and Tom's cheeks were looking particularly
brilliant as a relief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) best blue suit, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wore with
becoming calmness, having, after a little wrangling, effected what was
always the one point of interest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) toilet: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
transferred all the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) every-day pockets to those
actually in wear.

<p/>As for Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was just as pretty and neat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been
yesterday; no accidents ever happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) clothes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
never uncomfortable in them, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked with wondering pity at
Maggie, pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker. Maggie
would certainly have torn it off, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not been checked by the
remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) recent humiliation about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair; as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
confined herself to fretting and twisting, and behaving peevishly
about the card-houses which they were allowed to build till dinner, as
a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes. Tom
could build perfect pyramids of houses; but Maggie's would never bear
the laying on the roof. It was always so with the things that Maggie
made; and Tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make
anything. But it happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at
building; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) handled the cards so lightly, and moved so gently, that
Tom condescended to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) houses as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own, the more
readily because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). Maggie, too, would
have admired Lucy's houses, and would have given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
unsuccessful building to contemplate them, without ill temper, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
tucker had not made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) peevish, and if Tom had not inconsiderately
laughed when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) houses fell, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``a stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't laugh at me, Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) burst out angrily; <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a stupid. I
know a great many things you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dare say, Miss Spitfire! I'd never be such a cross thing as
you, making faces like that. Lucy doesn't do so. I like Lucy better
than you; _I_ wish Lucy was _my_ sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's very wicked and cruel of you to wish so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
starting up hurriedly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) place on the floor, and upsetting Tom's
wonderful pagoda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) really did not mean it, but the circumstantial
evidence was against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and Tom turned white with anger, but said
nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), only he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew it was cowardly to
strike a girl, and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would never do
anything cowardly.

<p/>Maggie stood in dismay and terror, while Tom got up from the floor and
walked away, pale, from the scattered ruins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pagoda, and Lucy
looked on mutely, like a kitten pausing from its lapping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, at last, going half-way toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
mean to knock it down, indeed, indeed I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), but took, instead, two or three hard peas
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket, and shot them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thumbnail against the
window, vaguely at first, but presently with the distinct aim of
hitting a superannuated blue-bottle which was exposing its imbecility
in the spring sunshine, clearly against the views of Nature, who had
provided Tom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak
individual.

<p/>Thus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie, and Tom's persistent
coldness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and
sunshine for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) called Lucy to look at the half-built bird's nest
without caring to show it Maggie, and peeled a willow switch for Lucy
and himself, without offering one to Maggie. Lucy had said, <div class="bookquote">``Maggie,
shouldn't _you_ like one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>but Tom was deaf.

<p/>Still, the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tail on the
stackyard wall, just as they reached Garum Firs, was enough to divert
the mind temporarily from personal grievances. And this was only the
beginning of beautiful sights at Garum Firs. All the farmyard life was
wonderful there,--bantams, speckled and top-knotted; Friesland hens,
with their feathers all turned the wrong way; Guinea-fowls that flew
and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers; pouter-pigeons
and a tame magpie; nay, a goat, and a wonderful brindled dog, half
mastiff, half bull-dog, as large as a lion. Then there were white
railings and white gates all about, and glittering weathercocks of
various design, and garden-walks paved with pebbles in beautiful
patterns,--nothing was quite common at Garum Firs; and Tom thought
that the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general
unusualness which characterized uncle Pullet's possessions as a
gentleman farmer. Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner. As for
the house, it was not less remarkable; it had a receding centre, and
two wings with battlemented turrets, and was covered with glittering
white stucco.

<p/>Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window,
and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door, kept always in
this fortified condition from fear of tramps, who might be supposed to
know of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall, and to
contemplate rushing in and carrying it away on their heads. Aunt
Pullet, too, appeared at the doorway, and as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) sister was
within hearing said, <div class="bookquote">``Stop the children, for God's sake! Bessy; don't
let 'em come up the door-steps; Sally's bringing the old mat and the
duster, to rub their shoes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pullet's front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes
on; the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work. Tom rebelled
particularly against this shoewiping, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) always considered in
the light of an indignity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sex. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt it as the beginning of
the disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) had
once been compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) boots; a fact
which may serve to correct the too-hasty conclusion that a visit to
Garum Firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of
animals,--fond, that is, of throwing stones at them.

<p/>The next disagreeable was confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feminine companions; it was
the mounting of the polished oak stairs, which had very handsome
carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that the ascent
of these glossy steps might have served, in barbarous times, as a
trial by ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could
have come off with unbroken limbs. Sophy's weakness about these
polished stairs was always a subject of bitter remonstrance on Mrs.
Glegg's part; but Mrs. Tulliver ventured on no comment, only thinking
to herself it was a mercy when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) and the children were safe on the
landing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Gray has sent home my new bonnet, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, in a
pathetic tone, as Mrs. Tulliver adjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, with an air of much interest.
<div class="bookquote">``And how do you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's apt to make a mess with clothes, taking 'em out and putting 'em
in again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) pocket
and looking at them earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``but it `ud be a pity for you to go
away without seeing it. There's no knowing what may happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pullet shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head slowly at this last serious consideration,
which determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) to single out a particular key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it'll be troublesome to you getting it out, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``but I _should_ like to see what sort of a crown she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s
made you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very
bright wardrobe, where you may have hastily supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) would find a
new bonnet. Not at all. Such a supposition could only have arisen from
a too-superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family.
In this wardrobe Mrs. Pullet was seeking something small enough to be
hidden among layers of linen,--it was a door-key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come with me into the best room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May the children come too, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>inquired Mrs. Tulliver, who saw
that Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``it'll perhaps be safer for
'em to come; they'll be touching something if we leave 'em behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/>So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor,
dimly lighted by the semi-lunar top of the window which rose above the
closed shutter; it was really quite solemn. Aunt Pullet paused and
unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the
passage,--a darkened room, in which the outer light, entering feebly,
showed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds.
Everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward. Lucy laid
hold of Maggie's frock, and Maggie's heart beat rapidly.

<p/>Aunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe,
with a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the
funereal solemnity of the scene. The delicious scent of rose-leaves
that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet
after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at, though the
sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to Maggie, who would
have preferred something more strikingly preternatural. But few things
could have been more impressive to Mrs. Tulliver. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked all round
it in silence for some moments, and then said emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``Well,
sister, I'll never speak against the full crowns again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a great concession, and Mrs. Pullet felt it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) felt something
was due to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd like to see it on, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) said sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll open the
shutter a bit further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you don't mind taking off your cap, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver.

<p/>Mrs. Pullet took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) cap, displaying the brown silk scalp with a
jutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and
judicious women of those times, and placing the bonnet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head,
turned slowly round, like a draper's lay-figure, that Mrs. Tulliver
might miss no point of view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've sometimes thought there's a loop too much o' ribbon on this left
side, sister; what do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
head on one side. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I think it's best as it is; if you meddled
with it, sister, you might repent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, taking off the bonnet and looking at
it contemplatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much might she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) charge you for that bonnet, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver, whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of
getting a humble imitation of this _chef-d'œuvre_ made from a piece
of silk she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had at home.

<p/>Mrs. Pullet screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) mouth and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head, and then
whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Pullet pays for it; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said I was to have the best bonnet
at Garum Church, let the next best be whose it would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) began slowly to adjust the trimmings, in preparation for returning
it to its place in the wardrobe, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) thoughts seemed to have taken
a melancholy turn, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``I may never wear it twice, sister; who
knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk o' that sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll
have your health this summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but there may come a death in the family, as there did soon after
I had my green satin bonnet. Cousin Abbott may go, and we can't think
o' wearing crape less nor half a year for him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbott</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That _would_ be unlucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, entering thoroughly
into the possibility of an inopportune decease. <div class="bookquote">``There's never so much
pleasure i' wearing a bonnet the second year, especially when the
crowns are so chancy,--never two summers alike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's the way i' this world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, returning the
bonnet to the wardrobe and locking it up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) maintained a silence
characterized by head-shaking, until they had all issued from the
solemn chamber and were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) own room again. Then, beginning to cry,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Sister, if you should never see that bonnet again till I'm
dead and gone, you'll remember I showed it you this day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) ought to be affected, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was a woman
of sparse tears, stout and healthy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) couldn't cry so much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
sister Pullet did, and had often felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) deficiency at funerals. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
effort to bring tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes issued in an odd contraction of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) face. Maggie, looking on attentively, felt that there was some
painful mystery about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt's bonnet which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was considered too
young to understand; indignantly conscious, all the while, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could have understood that, as well as everything else, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
been taken into confidence.

<p/>When they went down, uncle Pullet observed, with some acumen, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
reckoned the missis had been showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet,--that was what had
made them so long upstairs. With Tom the interval had seemed still
longer, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a
sofa directly opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Pullet, who regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) with
twinkling gray eyes, and occasionally addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``Young sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, young sir, what do you learn at school?''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>was a standing
question with uncle Pullet; whereupon Tom always looked sheepish,
rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands across his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>It was
altogether so embarrassing to be seated _tête-à-tête_ with uncle
Pullet, that Tom could not even look at the prints on the walls, or
the flycages, or the wonderful flower-pots; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
uncle's gaiters. Not that Tom was in awe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle's mental
superiority; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want to be
a gentleman farmer, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shouldn't like to be such a
thin-legged, silly fellow as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Pullet,--a molly-coddle, in
fact. A boy's sheepishness is by no means a sign of overmastering
reverence; and while you are making encouraging advances to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) under
the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) is overwhelmed by a sense of your age and wisdom, ten
to one he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) is thinking you extremely queer. The only consolation I can
suggest to you is, that the Greek boys probably thought the same of
Aristotle. It is only when you have mastered a restive horse, or
thrashed a drayman, or have got a gun in your hand, that these shy
juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable character. At
least, I am quite sure of Tom Tulliver's sentiments on these points.
In very tender years, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) still wore a lace border under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
outdoor cap, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was often observed peeping through the bars of a gate
and making minatory gestures with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) small forefinger while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr, intended to strike terror
into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire for
mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including
cockchafers, neighbors' dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has
been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race.
Now, Mr. Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony, and was
the least predatory of men, considering firearms dangerous, as apt to
go off of themselves by nobody's particular desire. So that Tom was
not without strong reasons when, in confidential talk with a chum, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had described uncle Pullet as a nincompoop, taking care at the same
time to observe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) was a very <div class="bookquote">``rich fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The only alleviating circumstance in a _tête-à-tête_ with uncle Pullet
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) kept a variety of lozenges and peppermint-drops about his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
person, and when at a loss for conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) filled up the void by
proposing a mutual solace of this kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like peppermints, young sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>required only a tacit answer
when it was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question.

<p/>The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the
further solace of small sweet-cakes, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) also kept a stock
under lock and key for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) own private eating on wet days; but the
three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their
fingers, than aunt Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till
the tray and the plates came, since with those crisp cakes they would
make the floor <div class="bookquote">``all over''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>crumbs. Lucy didn't mind that much, for the
cake was so pretty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought it was rather a pity to eat it; but
Tom, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opportunity while the elders were talking, hastily
stowed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth at two bites, and chewed it furtively. As for
Maggie, becoming fascinated, as usual, by a print of Ulysses and
Nausicaa, which uncle Pullet had bought as a <div class="bookquote">``pretty Scripture thing,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presently let fall her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cake, and in an unlucky movement crushed it
beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) foot,--a source of so much agitation to aunt Pullet and
conscious disgrace to Maggie, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to despair of hearing the
musical snuff-box to-day, till, after some reflection, it occurred to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that Lucy was in high favor enough to venture on asking for a
tune. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whispered to Lucy; and Lucy, who always did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
desired to do, went up quietly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) uncle's knee, and blush-all over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) neck while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fingered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) necklace, said, <div class="bookquote">``Will you please play
us a tune, uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle
Pullet that the snuff-box played such beautiful tunes, and indeed the
thing was viewed in that light by the majority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) neighbors in
Garum. Mr. Pullet had _bought_ the box, to begin with, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
understood winding it up, and knew which tune it was going to play
beforehand; altogether the possession of this unique <div class="bookquote">``piece of music''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was a proof that Mr. Pullet's character was not of that entire nullity
which might otherwise have been attributed to it. But uncle Pullet,
when entreated to exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) accomplishment, never depreciated it by
a too-ready consent. <div class="bookquote">``We'll see about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) always
gave, carefully abstaining from any sign of compliance till a suitable
number of minutes had passed. Uncle Pullet had a programme for all
great social occasions, and in this way fenced himself in from much
painful confusion and perplexing freedom of will.

<p/>Perhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie's enjoyment when the fairy
tune began; for the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) quite forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a load on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, that Tom was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and by the time <div class="bookquote">``Hush, ye
pretty warbling choir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>had been played, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face wore that bright
look of happiness, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat immovable with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands clasped,
which sometimes comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother with the sense that Maggie could
look pretty now and then, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brown skin. But when the
magic music ceased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) jumped up, and running toward Tom, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, isn't it pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt any new anger toward Maggie for this uncalled-for and, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),
inexplicable caress, I must tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glass of cowslip
wine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) jerked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spill half
of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily, <div class="bookquote">``Look
there, now!''  (<font color='red'><b>an milksop</b></font>)</div>especially when his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resentment was sanctioned, as it was,
by general disapprobation of Maggie's behavior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you sit still, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother said peevishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little gells mustn't come to see me if they behave in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said
aunt Pullet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you're too rough, little miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Pullet.

<p/>Poor Maggie sat down again, with the music all chased out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soul,
and the seven small demons all in again.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver, foreseeing nothing but misbehavior while the children
remained indoors, took an early opportunity of suggesting that, now
they were rested after their walk, they might go and play out of
doors; and aunt Pullet gave permission, only enjoining them not to go
off the paved walks in the garden, and if they wanted to see the
poultry fed, to view them from a distance on the horse-block; a
restriction which had been imposed ever since Tom had been found
guilty of running after the peacock, with an illusory idea that fright
would make one of its feathers drop off.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver's thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the
quarrel with Mrs. Glegg by millinery and maternal cares, but now the
great theme of the bonnet was thrown into perspective, and the
children were out of the way, yesterday's anxieties recurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It weighs on my mind so as never was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, by way of opening

I'd no wish t' offend a sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, <div class="bookquote">``there's no accounting for what Jane `ull do.
I wouldn't speak of it out o' the family, if it wasn't to Dr.
Turnbull; but it's my belief Jane lives too low. I've said so to
Pullet often and often, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you said so last Monday was a week, when we came away from
drinking tea with 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pullet, beginning to nurse his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) knee
and shelter it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) pocket-hand-kerchief, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) way when the
conversation took an interesting turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very like I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, <div class="bookquote">``for you remember when I said
things, better than I can remember myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>)'s got a wonderful

sister. <div class="bookquote">``I should be poorly off if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) was to have a stroke, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)

taking three sorts now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>rehearsed Mr. Pullet, with a punctuation determined by a lozenge on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, perhaps it `ud be better for sister Glegg if _she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'d_ go to the
doctor sometimes, instead o' chewing Turkey rhubarb whenever there's
anything the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, who naturally saw
the wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to Mrs. Glegg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's dreadful to think on,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) hands and
letting them fall again, <div class="bookquote">``people playing with their own insides in
that way! And it's flying i' the face o' Providence; for what are the
doctors for, if we aren't to call 'em in? And when folks have got the

many a time. I'm ashamed of acquaintance knowing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, _we've_ no call to be ashamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pullet, <div class="bookquote">``for Doctor

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pullet keeps all my physic-bottles, did you know, Bessy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk o' your going, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``I should have

there's nobody but you can get her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to make it up with Mr. Tulliver,

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, your husband _is_ awk`ard, you know, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet,

account as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s never behaved quite so pretty to our

very mischievous, and runs away from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) aunts and uncles, and the
gell's rude and brown. It's your bad luck, and I'm sorry for you,
Bessy; for you was allays my favorite sister, and we allays liked the
same patterns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know Tulliver's hasty, and says odd things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver,
wiping away one small tear from the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eye; <div class="bookquote">``but I'm sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s never been the man, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) married me, to object to my making

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ don't want to make the worst of you, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet,
compassionately, <div class="bookquote">``for I doubt you'll have trouble enough without that;
and your husband's got that poor sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) children hanging on
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),--and so given to lawing, they say. I doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll leave you poorly
off when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dies. Not as I'd have it said out o' the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/>This view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) position was naturally far from cheering to Mrs.
Tulliver. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) imagination was not easily acted on, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could not
help thinking that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) case was a hard one, since it appeared that
other people thought it hard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, sister, I can't help myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, urged by the fear
lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive, to take
comprehensive review of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) past conduct. <div class="bookquote">``There's no woman strives
more for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children; and I'm sure at scouring-time this Lady-day as
I've had all the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the two gells
put together; and there's the last elder-flower wine I've
made--beautiful! I allays offer it along with the sherry, though
sister Glegg will have it I'm so extravagant; and as for liking to
have my clothes tidy, and not go a fright about the house, there's
nobody in the parish can say anything against me in respect o'
backbiting and making mischief, for I don't wish anybody any harm; and
nobody loses by sending me a porkpie, for my pies are fit to show with
the best o' my neighbors'; and the linen's so in order as if I was to
die to-morrow I shouldn't be ashamed. A woman can do no more nor she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's all o' no use, you know, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, holding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head on one side, and fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) eyes pathetically on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) sister,
<div class="bookquote">``if your husband makes away with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) money. Not but what if you was
sold up, and other folks bought your furniture, it's a comfort to

maiden mark on, might go all over the country. It `ud be a sad pity
for our family.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pullet shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what can I do, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tulliver's not a
man to be dictated to,--not if I was to go to the parson and get by
heart what I should tell my husband for the best. And I'm sure I don't
pretend to know anything about putting out money and all that. I could
never see into men's business as sister Glegg does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you're like me in that, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet; <div class="bookquote">``and I think
it `ud be a deal more becoming o' Jane if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d have that pier-glass
rubbed oftener,--there was ever so many spots on it last
week,--instead o' dictating to folks as have more comings in than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
ever had, and telling 'em what they're to do with their money. But
Jane and me were allays contrairy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) _would_ have striped things,
and I like spots. You like a spot too, Bessy; we allays hung together
i' that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sophy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``I remember our having a blue ground
with a white spot both alike,--I've got a bit in a bed-quilt now; and
if you would but go and see sister Glegg, and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) to make it
up with Tulliver, I should take it very kind of you. You was allays a
good sister to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the right thing `ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
himself, and say he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was sorry for speaking so rash. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s borrowed
money of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) shouldn't be above that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, whose
partiality did not blind her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) to principles; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) did not forget what
was due to people of independent fortune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use talking o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs. Tulliver, almost
peevishly. <div class="bookquote">``If I was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to
Tulliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'d never humble himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can't expect me to persuade _Jane_ to beg pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Pullet. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) temper's beyond everything; it's well if it doesn't
carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind, though there never _was_ any of our family
went to a madhouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) begging pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``But if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d just take no notice, and not call her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) money in; as it's not so
much for one sister to ask of another; time `ud mend things, and
Tulliver `ud forget all about it, and they'd be friends again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver, you perceive, was not aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband's
irrevocable determination to pay in the five hundred pounds; at least
such a determination exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) powers of belief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, mournfully, <div class="bookquote">''_I_ don't want to help
you on to ruin. I won't be behindhand i' doing you a good turn, if it
is to be done. And I don't like it said among acquaintance as we've
got quarrels in the family. I shall tell Jane that; and I don't mind
driving to Jane's tomorrow, if Pullet doesn't mind. What do you say,
Mr. Pullet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no objections,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pullet, who was perfectly contented
with any course the quarrel might take, so that Mr. Tulliver did not
apply to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)_ for money. Mr. Pullet was nervous about his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
investments, and did not see how a man could have any security for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
money unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) turned it into land.

<p/>After a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better
for Mrs. Tulliver to accompany them on a visit to sister Glegg, Mrs.
Pullet, observing that it was tea-time, turned to reach from a drawer
a delicate damask napkin, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) pinned before her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) in the fashion
of an apron. The door did, in fact, soon open, but instead of the
tea-tray, Sally introduced an object so startling that both Mrs.
Pullet and Mrs. Tulliver gave a scream, causing uncle Pullet to
swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) lozenge--for the fifth time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) life, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) afterward
noted.



<p/>Chapter X

<p/>Maggie Behaves Worse Than She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) Expected


<p/>The startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle Pullet was no
other than little Lucy, with one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) person, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) small
foot to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bonnet-crown, wet and discolored with mud, holding out two
tiny blackened hands, and making a very piteous face. To account for
this unprecedented apparition in aunt Pullet's parlor, we must return
to the moment when the three children went to play out of doors, and
the small demons who had taken possession of Maggie's soul at an early
period of the day had returned in all the greater force after a
temporary absence. All the disagreeable recollections of the morning
were thick upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), when Tom, whose displeasure toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been
considerably refreshed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) foolish trick of causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to upset
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cowslip wine, said, <div class="bookquote">``Here, Lucy, you come along with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and
walked off to the area where the toads were, as if there were no
Maggie in existence. Seeing this, Maggie lingered at a distance
looking like a small Medusa with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) snakes cropped. Lucy was
naturally pleased that cousin Tom was so good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and it was very
amusing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the
toad was safe down the area, with an iron grating over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Still Lucy
wished Maggie to enjoy the spectacle also, especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would
doubtless find a name for the toad, and say what had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) past
history; for Lucy had a delighted semibelief in Maggie's stories about
the live things they came upon by accident,--how Mrs. Earwig had a
wash at home, and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) children had fallen into the hot copper,
for which reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was running so fast to fetch the doctor. Tom had
a profound contempt for this nonsense of Maggie's, smashing the earwig
at once as a superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire
unreality of such a story; but Lucy, for the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), could not
help fancying there was something in it, and at all events thought it
was very pretty make-believe. So now the desire to know the history of
a very portly toad, added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) habitual affectionateness, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
run back to Maggie and say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, there is such a big, funny toad,
Maggie! Do come and see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie said nothing, but turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with a deeper frown. As
long as Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), Lucy made part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
unkindness. Maggie would have thought a little while ago that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could never be cross with pretty little Lucy, any more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could
be cruel to a little white mouse; but then, Tom had always been quite
indifferent to Lucy before, and it had been left to Maggie to pet and
make much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was actually beginning to think that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),
especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dared, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't mind it. And if Lucy hadn't been there,
Maggie was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have got friends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sooner.

<p/>Tickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that
it is possible to exhaust, and Tom by and by began to look round for
some other mode of passing the time. But in so prim a garden, where
they were not to go off the paved walks, there was not a great choice
of sport. The only great pleasure such a restriction suggested was the
pleasure of breaking it, and Tom began to meditate an insurrectionary
visit to the pond, about a field's length beyond the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head up and down with great
significance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coiled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) string again, <div class="bookquote">``what do you think I
mean to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to go to the pond and look at the pike. You may go with me if
you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sultan</b></font>)</div>said the young sultan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, _dare_ you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Aunt said we mustn't go out of the
garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shall go out at the other end of the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody
`ull see us. Besides, I don't care if they do,--I'll run off home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But _I_ couldn't run,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, who had never before been exposed
to such severe temptation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, never mind; they won't be cross with _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``You say I
took you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom walked along, and Lucy trotted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side, timidly enjoying the
rare treat of doing something naughty,--excited also by the mention of
that celebrity, the pike, about which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was quite uncertain whether
it was a fish or a fowl.

<p/>Maggie saw them leaving the garden, and could not resist the impulse
to follow. Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their
objects than love, and that Tom and Lucy should do or see anything of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was ignorant would have been an intolerable idea to Maggie.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept a few yards behind them, unobserved by Tom, who was
presently absorbed in watching for the pike,--a highly interesting
monster; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was said to be so very old, so very large, and to have
such a remarkable appetite. The pike, like other celebrities, did not
show when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was watched for, but Tom caught sight of something in
rapid movement in the water, which attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to another spot on
the brink of the pond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said in a loud whisper, <div class="bookquote">``come here! take care! keep
on the grass!--don't step where the cows have been!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added,
pointing to a peninsula of dry grass, with trodden mud on each side of
it; for Tom's contemptuous conception of a girl included the attribute
of being unfit to walk in dirty places.

<p/>Lucy came carefully as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was bidden, and bent down to look at what
seemed a golden arrow-head darting through the water. It was a
water-snake, Tom told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); and Lucy at last could see the serpentine
wave of its body, very much wondering that a snake could swim. Maggie
had drawn nearer and nearer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) _must_ see it too, though it was
bitter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), like everything else, since Tom did not care about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
seeing it. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was close by Lucy; and Tom, who had been aware
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) approach, but would not notice it till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was obliged, turned
round and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, get away, Maggie; there's no room for you on the grass here.
Nobody asked _you_ to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There were passions at war in Maggie at that moment to have made a
tragedy, if tragedies were made by passion only; but the essential
-LSB-Greek text-RSB- which was present in the passion was wanting to the action;
the utmost Maggie could do, with a fierce thrust of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) small brown arm,
was to push poor little pink-and-white Lucy into the cow-trodden mud.

<p/>Then Tom could not restrain himself, and gave Maggie two smart slaps
on the arm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ran to pick up Lucy, who lay crying helplessly.
Maggie retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off, and looked on
impenitently. Usually her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) repentance came quickly after one rash deed,
but now Tom and Lucy had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) so miserable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was glad to spoil
their happiness,--glad to make everybody uncomfortable. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
be sorry? Tom was very slow to forgive _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_, however sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might
have been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall tell mother, you know, Miss Mag,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, loudly and
emphatically, as soon as Lucy was up and ready to walk away. It was
not Tom's practice to <div class="bookquote">``tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>but here justice clearly demanded that
Maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment; not that Tom had
learned to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) views in that abstract form; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never mentioned
<div class="bookquote">``justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and had no idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) desire to punish might be called
by that fine name. Lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had
befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),--the spoiling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pretty best clothes, and the
discomfort of being wet and dirty,--to think much of the cause, which
was entirely mysterious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could never have guessed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
had done to make Maggie angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt that Maggie was
very unkind and disagreeable, and made no magnanimous entreaties to
Tom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would not <div class="bookquote">``tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>only running along by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side and
crying piteously, while Maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked
after them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) small Medusa face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, when they reached the kitchen door, and Sally
looked at them in speechless amaze, with a piece of bread-and-butter
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) mouth and a toasting-fork in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) hand,--<div class="bookquote">``Sally, tell mother it
was Maggie pushed Lucy into the mud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sally</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Lors ha' massy, how did you get near such mud as that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sally</b></font>)</div>said
Sally, making a wry face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) stooped down and examined the _corpus
delicti_.

<p/>Tom's imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include
this question among the foreseen consequences, but it was no sooner
put than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) foresaw whither it tended, and that Maggie would not be
considered the only culprit in the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) walked quietly away from
the kitchen door, leaving Sally to that pleasure of guessing which
active minds notoriously prefer to ready-made knowledge.

<p/>Sally, as you are aware, lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlor
door, for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at
Garum Firs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>aunt Pullet exclaimed, after preluding by an
inarticulate scream; <div class="bookquote">``keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at the door, Sally! Don't bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) off
the oil-cloth, whatever you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an scream</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s tumbled into some nasty mud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, going up
to Lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
felt herself responsible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister Deane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, `um, it was Miss Maggie as pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sally</b></font>)</div>said Sally;
<div class="bookquote">``Master Tom's been and said so, and they must ha' been to the pond,
for it's only there they could ha' got into such dirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sally</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is, Bessy; it's what I've been telling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Pullet, in a tone of prophetic sadness; <div class="bookquote">``it's your children,--there's
no knowing what they'll come to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver was mute, feeling herself a truly wretched mother. As
usual, the thought pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that people would think she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
done something wicked to deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) maternal troubles, while Mrs.
Pullet began to give elaborate directions to Sally how to guard the
premises from serious injury in the course of removing the dirt.
Meantime tea was to be brought in by the cook, and the two naughty
children were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the kitchen.
Mrs. Tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children, supposing
them to be close at hand; but it was not until after some search that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) found Tom leaning with rather a hardened, careless air against the
white paling of the poultry-yard, and lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) piece of string on
the other side as a means of exasperating the turkey-cock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, you naughty boy, where's your sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, in a
distressed voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eagerness for justice on Maggie had
diminished since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought
about without the injustice of some blame on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where did you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother round</b></font>)</div>said the mother, looking round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sitting under the tree, against the pond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, apparently
indifferent to everything but the string and the turkey-cock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then go and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in this minute, you naughty boy. And how could
you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was
dirt? You know she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'ll do mischief if there's mischief to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Mrs. Tulliver's way, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) blamed Tom, to refer his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
misdemeanor, somehow or other, to Maggie.

<p/>The idea of Maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear
in Mrs. Tulliver's mind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mounted the horse-block to satisfy
herself by a sight of that fatal child, while Tom walked--not very
quickly--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're such children for the water, mine are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said aloud,
without reflecting that there was no one to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``they'll be
brought in dead and drownded some day. I wish that river was far
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) not only failed to discern Maggie, but presently saw Tom
returning from the pool alone, this hovering fear entered and took
complete possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hurried to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie's nowhere about the pond, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s gone
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>You may conceive the terrified search for Maggie, and the difficulty
of convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not in the pond. Mrs. Pullet
observed that the child might come to a worse end if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) lived, there
was no knowing; and Mr. Pullet, confused and overwhelmed by this
revolutionary aspect of things,--the tea deferred and the poultry
alarmed by the unusual running to and fro,--took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) spud as an
instrument of search, and reached down a key to unlock the goose-pen,
as a likely place for Maggie to lie concealed in.

<p/>Tom, after a while, started the idea that Maggie was gone home
-LRB-without thinking it necessary to state that it was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should
have done himself under the circumstances-RRB-, and the suggestion was
seized as a comfort by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister, for goodness' sake let 'em put the horse in the carriage and
take me home; we shall perhaps find her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on the road. Lucy can't walk
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dirty clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, looking at that innocent victim, who
was wrapped up in a shawl, and sitting with naked feet on the sofa.

<p/>Aunt Pullet was quite willing to take the shortest means of restoring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) premises to order and quiet, and it was not long before Mrs.
Tulliver was in the chaise, looking anxiously at the most distant
point before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). What the father would say if Maggie was lost, was a
question that predominated over every other.



<p/>Chapter XI

<p/>Maggie Tries to Run away from Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) Shadow


<p/>Maggie's intentions, as usual, were on a larger scale than Tom
imagined. The resolution that gathered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, after Tom and Lucy
had walked away, was not so simple as that of going home. No! she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
would run away and go to the gypsies, and Tom should never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) any
more. That was by no means a new idea to Maggie; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been so often
told she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was like a gypsy, and <div class="bookquote">``half wild,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gypsy</b></font>)</div>that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
miserable it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the only way of escaping opprobrium, and
being entirely in harmony with circumstances, would be to live in a
little brown tent on the commons; the gypsies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) considered, would
gladly receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) much respect on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) superior
knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had once mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) views on this point to Tom and
suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should stain his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face brown, and they should run
away together; but Tom rejected the scheme with contempt, observing
that gypsies were thieves, and hardly got anything to eat and had
nothing to drive but a donkey. To-day however, Maggie thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
misery had reached a pitch at which gypsydom was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) refuge, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this
was a great crisis in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would run straight away till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
came to Dunlow Common, where there would certainly be gypsies; and
cruel Tom, and the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) relations who found fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
should never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) any more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ran
along, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reconciled herself to the idea of parting with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), by
determining that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would secretly send him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a letter by a small
gypsy, who would run away without telling where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was, and just let
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was well and happy, and always loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very much.

<p/>Maggie soon got out of breath with running, but by the time Tom got to
the pond again she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was at the distance of three long fields, and was
on the edge of the lane leading to the highroad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stopped to pant a
little, reflecting that running away was not a pleasant thing until
one had got quite to the common where the gypsies were, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
resolution had not abated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presently passed through the gate into
the lane, not knowing where it would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), for it was not this way
that they came from Dorlcote Mill to Garum Firs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt all the
safer for that, because there was no chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) being overtaken.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was soon aware, not without trembling, that there were two men
coming along the lane in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not thought of meeting
strangers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been too much occupied with the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friends
coming after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). The formidable strangers were two shabby-looking men
with flushed faces, one of them carrying a bundle on a stick over his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
shoulder; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) surprise, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was dreading their
disapprobation as a runaway, the man with the bundle stopped, and in a
half-whining, half-coaxing tone asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a copper to give
a poor man. Maggie had a sixpence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pocket,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) uncle Glegg's
present,--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) immediately drew out and gave this poor man with a
polite smile, hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would feel very kindly toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as a
generous person. <div class="bookquote">``That's the only money I've got,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said
apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, little miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, in a less
respectful and grateful tone than Maggie anticipated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) even
observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled and winked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walked on
hurriedly, but was aware that the two men were standing still,
probably to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presently heard them laughing
loudly. Suddenly it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that they might think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was an
idiot; Tom had said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cropped hair made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) look like an idiot,
and it was too painful an idea to be readily forgotten. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had no sleeves on,--only a cape and bonnet. It was clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
not likely to make a favorable impression on passengers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would turn into the fields again, but not on the same side
of the lane as before, lest they should still be uncle Pullet's
fields. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned through the first gate that was not locked, and
felt a delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by the hedgerows,
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) recent humiliating encounter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was used to wandering
about the fields by herself, and was less timid there than on the
highroad. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to climb over high gates, but that was a
small evil; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was getting out of reach very fast, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should
probably soon come within sight of Dunlow Common, or at least of some
other common, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father say that you couldn't go
very far without coming to a common. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hoped so, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was getting
rather tired and hungry, and until she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reached the gypsies there was
no definite prospect of bread and butter. It was still broad daylight,
for aunt Pullet, retaining the early habits of the Dodson family, took
tea at half-past four by the sun, and at five by the kitchen clock;
so, though it was nearly an hour since Maggie started, there was no
gathering gloom on the fields to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that the night would come.
Still, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been walking a very great
distance indeed, and it was really surprising that the common did not
come within sight. Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been in the rich parish of Garum,
where was a great deal of pasture-land, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had only seen one
laborer at a distance. That was fortunate in some respects, as
laborers might be too ignorant to understand the propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
wanting to go to Dunlow Common; yet it would have been better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could have met some one who would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the way without wanting to
know anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) private business. At last, however, the green
fields came to an end, and Maggie found herself looking through the
bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never seen such a wide lane before, and, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
knowing why, it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the impression that the common could not be
far off; perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw a donkey with a log to his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
foot feeding on the grassy margin, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seen a donkey with that
pitiable encumbrance on Dunlow Common when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been across it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's gig. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) crept through the bars of the gate and walked on
with new spirit, though not without haunting images of Apollyon, and a
highwayman with a pistol, and a blinking dwarf in yellow with a mouth
from ear to ear, and other miscellaneous dangers. For poor little
Maggie had at once the timidity of an active imagination and the
daring that comes from overmastering impulse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had rushed into the
adventure of seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) unknown kindred, the gypsies; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
in this strange lane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hardly dared look on one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), lest
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should see the diabolical blacksmith in his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) leathern apron
grinning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with arms akimbo. It was not without a leaping of the
heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) caught sight of a small pair of bare legs sticking up,
feet uppermost, by the side of a hillock; they seemed something
hideously preternatural,--a diabolical kind of fungus; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was too
much agitated at the first glance to see the ragged clothes and the
dark shaggy head attached to them. It was a boy asleep, and Maggie
trotted along faster and more lightly, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should wake him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); it
did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friends the gypsies, who
in all probability would have very genial manners. But the fact was
so, for at the next bend in the lane Maggie actually saw the little
semicircular black tent with the blue smoke rising before it, which
was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) refuge from all the blighting obloquy that had pursued
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in civilized life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) even saw a tall female figure by the column
of smoke, doubtless the gypsy-mother, who provided the tea and other
groceries; it was astonishing to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not feel more
delighted. But it was startling to find the gypsies in a lane, after
all, and not on a common; indeed, it was rather disappointing; for a
mysterious illimitable common, where there were sand-pits to hide in,
and one was out of everybody's reach, had always made part of Maggie's
picture of gypsy life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, however, and thought with some
comfort that gypsies most likely knew nothing about idiots, so there
was no danger of their falling into the mistake of setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) down at
the first glance as an idiot. It was plain she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had attracted
attention; for the tall figure, who proved to be a young woman with a
baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm, walked slowly to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Maggie looked up in the
new face rather tremblingly as it approached, and was reassured by the
thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Pullet and the rest were right when they called
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a gypsy; for this face, with the bright dark eyes and the long
hair, was really something like what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) used to see in the glass
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little lady, where are you going to?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gypsy</b></font>)</div>the gypsy said, in a tone of
coaxing deference.

<p/>It was delightful, and just what Maggie expected; the gypsies saw at
once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was a little lady, and were prepared to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
accordingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not any farther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had rehearsed in a dream. <div class="bookquote">``I'm come to stay with _you_, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's pretty; come, then. Why, what a nice little lady you are, to
be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gypsy</b></font>)</div>said the gypsy, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by the hand. Maggie thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
very agreeable, but wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not been so dirty.

<p/>There was quite a group round the fire when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reached it. An old
gypsy woman was seated on the ground nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees, and
occasionally poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an
odorous steam; two small shock-headed children were lying prone and
resting on their elbows something like small sphinxes; and a placid
donkey was bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head over a tall girl, who, lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back,
was scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nose and indulging him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with a bite of excellent
stolen hay. The slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them, and the scene
was really very pretty and comfortable, Maggie thought, only she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hoped
they would soon set out the tea-cups. Everything would be quite
charming when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had taught the gypsies to use a washing-basin, and
to feel an interest in books. It was a little confusing, though, that
the young woman began to speak to the old one in a language which
Maggie did not understand, while the tall girl, who was feeding the
donkey, sat up and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) without offering any salutation. At
last the old woman said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! my pretty lady, are you come to stay with us? Sit ye down and
tell us where you come from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>It was just like a story; Maggie liked to be called pretty lady and
treated in this way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat down and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm come from home because I'm unhappy, and I mean to be a gypsy.
I'll live with you if you like, and I can teach you a great many
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a clever little lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman with the baby sitting down
by Maggie, and allowing baby to crawl; <div class="bookquote">``and such a pretty bonnet and
frock,''  (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, taking off Maggie's bonnet and looking at it while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made an observation to the old woman, in the unknown language. The
tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own head hind-foremost
with a grin; but Maggie was determined not to show any weakness on
this subject, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were susceptible about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to wear a bonnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather wear a red
handkerchief, like yours''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``My
hair was quite long till yesterday, when I cut it off; but I dare say
it will grow again very soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added apologetically, thinking it
probable the gypsies had a strong prejudice in favor of long hair. And
Maggie had forgotten even her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hunger at that moment in the desire to
conciliate gypsy opinion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a nice little lady!--and rich, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old
woman. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you live in a beautiful house at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my home is pretty, and I'm very fond of the river, where we go
fishing, but I'm often very unhappy. I should have liked to bring my
books with me, but I came away in a hurry, you know. But I can tell
you almost everything there is in my books, I've read them so many
times, and that will amuse you. And I can tell you something about
Geography too,--that's about the world we live in,--very useful and
interesting. Did you ever hear about Columbus?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's eyes had begun to sparkle and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheeks to flush,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
really beginning to instruct the gypsies, and gaining great influence
over them. The gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this
talk, though their attention was divided by the contents of Maggie's
pocket, which the friend at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) right hand had by this time emptied
without attracting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) notice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that where you live, my little lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, at the
mention of Columbus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with some pity; <div class="bookquote">``Columbus was a very wonderful
man, who found out half the world, and they put chains on him (<font color='blue'><b>Columbus</b></font>) and
treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Columbus</b></font>) very badly, you know; it's in my Catechism of Geography,
but perhaps it's rather too long to tell before tea--_I want my tea
so_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words burst from Maggie, in spite of herself, with a sudden
drop from patronizing instruction to simple peevishness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s hungry, poor little lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the younger woman. <div class="bookquote">``Give
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) some o' the cold victual. You've been walking a good way, I'll be
bound, my dear. Where's your home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Dorlcote Mill, a good way off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``My father is Mr.
Tulliver, but we mustn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) know where I am, else he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'ll fetch me
home again. Where does the queen of the gypsies live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! do you want to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), my little lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the younger
woman. The tall girl meanwhile was constantly staring at Maggie and
grinning. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) manners were certainly not agreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``I'm only thinking that if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) isn't a very good
queen you might be glad when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) died, and you could choose another.
If I was a queen, I'd be a very good queen, and kind to everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a bit o' nice victual, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, handing to
Maggie a lump of dry bread, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had taken from a bag of scraps,
and a piece of cold bacon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking at the food without taking it; <div class="bookquote">``but
will you give me some bread-and-butter and tea instead? I don't like
bacon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got no tea nor butter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, with something like
a scowl, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were getting tired of coaxing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a little bread and treacle would do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We han't got no treacle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, crossly, whereupon
there followed a sharp dialogue between the two women in their unknown
tongue, and one of the small sphinxes snatched at the bread-and-bacon,
and began to eat it. At this moment the tall girl, who had gone a few
yards off, came back, and said something which produced a strong
effect. The old woman, seeming to forget Maggie's hunger, poked the
skewer into the pot with new vigor, and the younger crept under the
tent and reached out some platters and spoons. Maggie trembled a
little, and was afraid the tears would come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes. Meanwhile
the tall girl gave a shrill cry, and presently came running up the boy
whom Maggie had passed as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sleeping,--a rough urchin about the
age of Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stared at Maggie, and there ensued much incomprehensible
chattering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt very lonely, and was quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should begin to
cry before long; the gypsies didn't seem to mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt
quite weak among them. But the springing tears were checked by new
terror, when two men came up, whose approach had been the cause
of the sudden excitement. The elder of the two carried a bag, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) flung down, addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone,
which they answered by a shower of treble sauciness; while a black
cur ran barking up to Maggie, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into a tremor that only
found a new cause in the curses with which the younger man called
the dog off, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a rap with a great stick he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Maggie felt that it was impossible she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should ever be queen of these
people, or ever communicate to them amusing and useful knowledge.

<p/>Both the men now seemed to be inquiring about Maggie, for they looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and the tone of the conversation became of that pacific kind
which implies curiosity on one side and the power of satisfying it on
the other. At last the younger woman said in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) previous deferential,
coaxing tone,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This nice little lady's come to live with us; aren't you glad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the younger man, who was looking at Maggie's
silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman,
with some observation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) immediately restored them to Maggie's
pocket, while the men seated themselves, and began to attack the
contents of the kettle,--a stew of meat and potatoes,--which had been
taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter.

<p/>Maggie began to think that Tom must be right about the gypsies; they
must certainly be thieves, unless the man meant to return her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thimble
by and by. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would willingly have given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not
at all attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thimble; but the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was among
thieves prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from feeling any comfort in the revival of
deference and attention toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); all thieves, except Robin Hood,
were wicked people. The women saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got nothing nice for a lady to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
coaxing tone. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s so hungry, sweet little lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, my dear, try if you can eat a bit o' this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the younger
woman, handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to
Maggie, who, remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
for not liking the bread-and-bacon, dared not refuse the stew, though
fear had chased away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appetite. If her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father would but come by in
the gig and take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up! Or even if Jack the Giantkiller, or Mr.
Greatheart, or St. George who slew the dragon on the half-pennies,
would happen to pass that way! But Maggie thought with a sinking heart
that these heroes were never seen in the neighborhood of St. Ogg's;
nothing very wonderful ever came there.

<p/>Maggie Tulliver, you perceive, was by no means that well trained,
well-informed young person that a small female of eight or nine
necessarily is in these days; she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) had only been to school a year at
St. Ogg's, and had so few books that she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) sometimes read the
dictionary; so that in travelling over her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) small mind you would have
found the most unexpected ignorance as well as unexpected knowledge.
She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) could have informed you that there was such a word as <div class="bookquote">``polygamy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and being also acquainted with <div class="bookquote">``polysyllable,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) had deduced the
conclusion that <div class="bookquote">``poly''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>mean <div class="bookquote">``many'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; but she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) had had no idea that
gypsies were not well supplied with groceries, and her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) thoughts
generally were the oddest mixture of clear-eyed acumen and blind
dreams.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid modification in the
last five minutes. From having considered them very respectful
companions, amenable to instruction, she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) had begun to think that they
meant perhaps to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) as soon as it was dark, and cut up her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) body
for gradual cooking; the suspicion crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) that the fierce-eyed
old man was in fact the Devil, who might drop that transparent
disguise at any moment, and turn either into the grinning blacksmith,
or else a fiery-eyed monster with dragon's wings. It was no use trying
to eat the stew, and yet the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) most dreaded was to offend the
gypsies, by betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) extremely unfavorable opinion of them; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) wondered, with a keenness of interest that no theologian could
have exceeded, whether, if the Devil were really present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) would
know her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you don't like the smell of it, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman,
observing that Maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew. <div class="bookquote">``Try a
bit, come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, summoning all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) force for a desperate
effort, and trying to smile in a friendly way. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't time, I
think; it seems getting darker. I think I must go home now, and come
again another day, and then I can bring you a basket with some
jam-tarts and things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) threw out this illusory prospect,
devoutly hoping that Apollyon was gullible; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hope sank when the
old gypsy-woman said, <div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit, stop a bit, little lady; we'll take
you home, all safe, when we've done supper; you shall ride home, like
a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Apollyon</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie sat down again, with little faith in this promise, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey, and
throwing a couple of bags on his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, little missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the younger man, rising, and leading
the donkey forward, <div class="bookquote">``tell us where you live; what's the name o' the
place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorlcote Mill is my home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``My father is Mr.
Tulliver; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lives there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! a big mill a little way this side o' St. Ogg's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Is it far off? I think I should like to walk
there, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it'll be getting dark, we must make haste. And the donkey'll
carry you as nice as can be; you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted Maggie as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on the donkey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt
relieved that it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had only a trembling hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was really going home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's your pretty bonnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the younger woman, putting that
recently despised but now welcome article of costume on Maggie's head;
<div class="bookquote">``and you'll say we've been very good to you, won't you? and what a
nice little lady we said you was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``I'm very much obliged to you. But I
wish you'd go with me too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought anything was better than going
with one of the dreadful men alone; it would be more cheerful to be
murdered by a larger party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you're fondest o' _me_, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. <div class="bookquote">``But I can't
go; you'll go too fast for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>It now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey,
holding Maggie before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was as incapable of remonstrating
against this arrangement as the donkey himself, though no nightmare
had ever seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more horrible. When the woman had patted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on
the back, and said <div class="bookquote">``Good-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the donkey, at a strong hint from the
man's stick, set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the point
Maggie had come from an hour ago, while the tall girl and the rough
urchin, also furnished with sticks, obligingly escorted them for the
first hundred yards, with much screaming and thwacking.

<p/>Not Leonore, in that preternatural midnight excursion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) phantom
lover, was more terrified than poor Maggie in this entirely natural
ride on a short-paced donkey, with a gypsy behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), who considered
that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was earning half a crown. The red light of the setting sun
seemed to have a portentous meaning, with which the alarming bray of
the second donkey with the log on its foot must surely have some
connection. Two low thatched cottages--the only houses they passed in
this lane--seemed to add to its dreariness; they had no windows to
speak of, and the doors were closed; it was probable that they were
inhabitated by witches, and it was a relief to find that the donkey
did not stop there.

<p/>At last--oh, sight of joy!--this lane, the longest in the world, was
coming to an end, was opening on a broad highroad, where there was
actually a coach passing! And there was a finger-post at the
corner,--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had surely seen that finger-post before,--<div class="bookquote">``To St. Ogg's,
2 miles.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The gypsy really meant to take her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) home, then; he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was
probably a good man, after all, and might have been rather hurt at the
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) didn't like coming with him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) alone. This idea became
stronger as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt more and more certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knew the road
quite well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was considering how she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might open a conversation
with the injured gypsy, and not only gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) feelings but efface
the impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cowardice, when, as they reached a cross-road.
Maggie caught sight of some one coming on a white-faced horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, stop, stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``There's my father! Oh, father,
father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The sudden joy was almost painful, and before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was sobbing. Great was Mr. Tulliver's wonder, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had made a
round from Basset, and had not yet been home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the meaning o' this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) said, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) horse, while
Maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's stirrup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The little miss lost herself, I reckon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gypsy</b></font>)</div>said the gypsy. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d come
to our tent at the far end o' Dunlow Lane, and I was bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
where she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) home was. It's a good way to come after being on
the tramp all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s been very good to bring me home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said
Maggie,--<div class="bookquote">``a very kind, good man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, then, my man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, taking out five shillings.
<div class="bookquote">``It's the best day's work _you_ ever did. I couldn't afford to lose
the little wench; here, lift her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Maggie, how's this, how's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, as they rode along,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father and sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``How came you
to be rambling about and lose yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>sobbed Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``I ran away because I was so unhappy; Tom
was so angry with me. I couldn't bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``you mustn't think o'
running away from father. What `ud father do without his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little
wench?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I never will again, father--never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind very strongly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) reached home that
evening; and the effect was seen in the remarkable fact that Maggie
never heard one reproach from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, or one taunt from Tom, about
this foolish business of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) running away to the gypsies. Maggie was
rather awe-stricken by this unusual treatment, and sometimes thought
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conduct had been too wicked to be alluded to.



<p/>Chapter XII

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Glegg at Home


<p/>In order to see Mr. and Mrs. Glegg at home, we must enter the town of
St. Ogg's,--that venerable town with the red fluted roofs and the
broad warehouse gables, where the black ships unlade themselves of
their burthens from the far north, and carry away, in exchange, the
precious inland products, the well-crushed cheese and the soft fleeces
which my refined readers have doubtless become acquainted with through
the medium of the best classic pastorals.

<p/>It is one of those old, old towns which impress one as a continuation
and outgrowth of nature, as much as the nests of the bower-birds or
the winding galleries of the white ants; a town which carries the
traces of its long growth and history like a millennial tree, and has
sprung up and developed in the same spot between the river and the low
hill from the time when the Roman legions turned their backs on it
from the camp on the hillside, and the long-haired sea-kings came up
the river and looked with fierce, eager eyes at the fatness of the
land. It is a town <div class="bookquote">``familiar with forgotten years.''  (<font color='red'><b>Saxon</b></font>)</div>The shadow of the
Saxon hero-king still walks there fitfully, reviewing the scenes of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) youth and love-time, and is met by the gloomier shadow of the
dreadful heathen Dane, who was stabbed in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dane</b></font>) warriors by
the sword of an invisible avenger, and who rises on autumn evenings
like a white mist from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dane</b></font>) tumulus on the hill, and hovers in the
court of the old hall by the river-side, the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dane</b></font>) was thus
miraculously slain in the days before the old hall was built. It was
the Normans who began to build that fine old hall, which is, like the
town, telling of the thoughts and hands of widely sundered
generations; but it is all so old that we look with loving pardon at
its inconsistencies, and are well content that they who built the
stone oriel, and they who built the Gothic façade and towers of finest
small brickwork with the trefoil ornament, and the windows and
battlements defined with stone, did not sacreligiously pull down the
ancient half-timbered body with its oak-roofed banqueting-hall.

<p/>But older even than this old hall is perhaps the bit of wall now built
into the belfry of the parish church, and said to be a remnant of the
original chapel dedicated to St. Ogg, the patron saint of this ancient
town, of whose history I possess several manuscript versions. I
incline to the briefest, since, if it should not be wholly true, it is
at least likely to contain the least falsehood. <div class="bookquote">``Ogg the son of
Beorl,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says my private hagiographer, ``was a boatman who gained a
scanty living by ferrying passengers across the river Floss. And it
came to pass, one evening when the winds were high, that there sat
moaning by the brink of the river a woman with a child in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was clad in rags, and had a worn and withered look, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
craved to be rowed across the river. And the men thereabout questioned
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and said, ``Wherefore dost thou desire to cross the river? Tarry
till the morning, and take shelter here for the night; so shalt thou
be wise and not foolish.'' Still she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) went on to mourn and crave. But
Ogg the son of Beorl came up and said, ``I will ferry thee across; it
is enough that thy heart needs it.'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) ferried her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) across. And it
came to pass, when she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) stepped ashore, that her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) rags were turned into
robes of flowing white, and her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) face became bright with exceeding
beauty, and there was a glory around it, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) shed a light on
the water like the moon in its brightness. And she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said, ``Ogg, the son
of Beorl, thou art blessed in that thou didst not question and wrangle
with the heart's need, but wast smitten with pity, and didst
straightway relieve the same. And from henceforth whoso steps into thy
boat shall be in no peril from the storm; and whenever it puts forth
to the rescue, it shall save the lives both of men and beasts.<div class="bookquote">'' And
when the floods came, many were saved by reason of that blessing on
the boat. But when Ogg the son of Beorl died, behold, in the parting
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) soul, the boat loosed itself from its moorings, and was floated
with the ebbing tide in great swiftness to the ocean, and was seen no
more. Yet it was witnessed in the floods of aftertime, that at the
coming on of eventide, Ogg the son of Beorl was always seen with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>)
boat upon the wide-spreading waters, and the Blessed Virgin sat in the
prow, shedding a light around as of the moon in its brightness, so
that the rowers in the gathering darkness took heart and pulled anew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men beasts</b></font>)</div><p/>This legend, one sees, reflects from a far-off time the visitation of
the floods, which, even when they left human life untouched, were
widely fatal to the helpless cattle, and swept as sudden death over
all smaller living things. But the town knew worse troubles even than
the floods,--troubles of the civil wars, when it was a continual
fighting-place, where first Puritans thanked God for the blood of the
Loyalists, and then Loyalists thanked God for the blood of the
Puritans. Many honest citizens lost all their possessions for
conscience' sake in those times, and went forth beggared from their
native town. Doubtless there are many houses standing now on which
those honest citizens turned their backs in sorrow,--quaint-gabled
houses looking on the river, jammed between newer warehouses, and
penetrated by surprising passages, which turn and turn at sharp angles
till they lead you out on a muddy strand overflowed continually by the
rushing tide. Everywhere the brick houses have a mellow look, and in
Mrs. Glegg's day there was no incongruous new-fashioned smartness, no
plate-glass in shop-windows, no fresh stucco-facing or other
fallacious attempt to make fine old red St. Ogg's wear the air of a
town that sprang up yesterday. The shop-windows were small and
unpretending; for the farmers' wives and daughters who came to do
their shopping on market-days were not to be withdrawn from their
regular well-known shops; and the tradesmen had no wares intended for
customers who would go on their way and be seen no more. Ah! even Mrs.
Glegg's day seems far back in the past now, separated from us by
changes that widen the years. War and the rumor of war had then died
out from the minds of men, and if they were ever thought of by the
farmers in drab greatcoats, who shook the grain out of their
sample-bags and buzzed over it in the full market-place, it was as a
state of things that belonged to a past golden age when prices were
high. Surely the time was gone forever when the broad river could
bring up unwelcome ships; Russia was only the place where the linseed
came from,--the more the better,--making grist for the great vertical
millstones with their scythe-like arms, roaring and grinding and
carefully sweeping as if an informing soul were in them. The
Catholics, bad harvests, and the mysterious fluctuations of trade were
the three evils mankind had to fear; even the floods had not been
great of late years. The mind of St. Ogg's did not look extensively
before or after. It inherited a long past without thinking of it, and
had no eyes for the spirits that walk the streets. Since the centuries
when St. Ogg with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) boat and the Virgin Mother at the prow had been
seen on the wide water, so many memories had been left behind, and had
gradually vanished like the receding hilltops! And the present time
was like the level plain where men lose their belief in volcanoes and
earthquakes, thinking to-morrow will be as yesterday, and the giant
forces that used to shake the earth are forever laid to sleep. The
days were gone when people could be greatly wrought upon by their
faith, still less change it; the Catholics were formidable because
they would lay hold of government and property, and burn men alive;
not because any sane and honest parishioner of St. Ogg's could be
brought to believe in the Pope. One aged person remembered how a rude
multitude had been swayed when John Wesley preached in the
cattle-market; but for a long while it had not been expected of
preachers that they should shake the souls of men. An occasional burst
of fervor in Dissenting pulpits on the subject of infant baptism was
the only symptom of a zeal unsuited to sober times when men had done
with change. Protestantism sat at ease, unmindful of schisms, careless
of proselytism: Dissent was an inheritance along with a superior pew
and a business connection; and Churchmanship only wondered
contemptuously at Dissent as a foolish habit that clung greatly to
families in the grocery and chandlering lines, though not incompatible
with prosperous wholesale dealing. But with the Catholic Question had
come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm: the elderly
rector had become occasionally historical and argumentative; and Mr.
Spray, the Independent minister, had begun to preach political
sermons, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) distinguished with much subtlety between his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
fervent belief in the right of the Catholics to the franchise and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
fervent belief in their eternal perdition. Most of Mr. Spray's
hearers, however, were incapable of following his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) subtleties, and many
old-fashioned Dissenters were much pained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``siding with the
Catholics'' (<font color='red'><b>Dissenters</b></font>)</div>; while others thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had better let politics alone.
Public spirit was not held in high esteem at St. Ogg's, and men who
busied themselves with political questions were regarded with some
suspicion, as dangerous characters; they were usually persons who had
little or no business of their own to manage, or, if they had, were
likely enough to become insolvent.

<p/>This was the general aspect of things at St. Ogg's in Mrs. Glegg's
day, and at that particular period in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) family history when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) quarrel with Mr. Tulliver. It was a time when ignorance was
much more comfortable than at present, and was received with all the
honors in very good society, without being obliged to dress itself in
an elaborate costume of knowledge; a time when cheap periodicals were
not, and when country surgeons never thought of asking their female
patients if they were fond of reading, but simply took it for granted
that they preferred gossip; a time when ladies in rich silk gowns wore
large pockets, in which they carried a mutton-bone to secure them
against cramp. Mrs. Glegg carried such a bone, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had inherited
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) grandmother with a brocaded gown that would stand up empty,
like a suit of armor, and a silver-headed walking-stick; for the
Dodson family had been respectable for many generations.

<p/>Mrs. Glegg had both a front and a back parlor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) excellent house
at St. Ogg's, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had two points of view from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) could
observe the weakness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) fellow-beings, and reinforce her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
thankfulness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own exceptional strength of mind. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) front
window she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) could look down the Tofton Road, leading out of St. Ogg's,
and note the growing tendency to <div class="bookquote">``gadding about''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Ogg/Ogg</b></font>)</div>in the wives of men
not retired from business, together with a practice of wearing woven
cotton stockings, which opened a dreary prospect for the coming
generation; and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) back windows she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) could look down the pleasant
garden and orchard which stretched to the river, and observe the folly
of Mr. Glegg in spending his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) time among <div class="bookquote">``them flowers and vegetables.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>For Mr. Glegg, having retired from active business as a wool-stapler
for the purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) life, had
found this last occupation so much more severe than his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) business, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had been driven into amateur hard labor as a dissipation, and
habitually relaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners. The
economizing of a gardener's wages might perhaps have induced Mrs.
Glegg to wink at this folly, if it were possible for a healthy female
mind even to simulate respect for a husband's hobby. But it is well
known that this conjugal complacency belongs only to the weaker
portion of the sex, who are scarcely alive to the responsibilities of
a wife as a constituted check on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's pleasures, which are
hardly ever of a rational or commendable kind.

<p/>Mr. Glegg on his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) side, too, had a double source of mental occupation,
which gave every promise of being inexhaustible. On the one hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
surprised himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) discoveries in natural history, finding that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) piece of garden-ground contained wonderful caterpillars, slugs,
and insects, which, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had heard, had never before attracted
human observation; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) noticed remarkable coincidences between
these zoological phenomena and the great events of that time,--as, for
example, that before the burning of York Minster there had been
mysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the rose-trees, together
with an unusual prevalence of slugs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had been puzzled to know
the meaning of, until it flashed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) with this melancholy
conflagration. -LRB-Mr. Glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity,
which, when disengaged from the wool business, naturally made itself a
pathway in other directions.-RRB- And his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) second subject of meditation was
the <div class="bookquote">``contrairiness''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>of the female mind, as typically exhibited in Mrs.
Glegg. That a creature made--in a genealogical sense--out of a man's
rib, and in this particular case maintained in the highest
respectability without any trouble of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own, should be normally in a
state of contradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the
most accommodating concessions, was a mystery in the scheme of things
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had often in vain sought a clew in the early chapters of
Genesis. Mr. Glegg had chosen the eldest Miss Dodson as a handsome
embodiment of female prudence and thrift, and being himself of a
money-getting, money-keeping turn, had calculated on much conjugal
harmony. But in that curious compound, the feminine character, it may
easily happen that the flavor is unpleasant in spite of excellent
ingredients; and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with
a seasoning that quite spoils its relish. Now, good Mr. Glegg himself
was stingy in the most amiable manner; his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) neighbors called him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``near,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which always means that the person in question is a lovable
skinflint. If you expressed a preference for cheese-parings, Mr. Glegg
would remember to save them for you, with a good-natured delight in
gratifying your palate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was given to pet all animals which
required no appreciable keep. There was no humbug or hypocrisy about
Mr. Glegg; his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale
of a widow's furniture, which a five-pound note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) side pocket
would have prevented; but a donation of five pounds to a person <div class="bookquote">``in a
small way of life''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>would have seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) a mad kind of lavishness
rather than <div class="bookquote">``charity,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which had always presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) as a
contribution of small aids, not a neutralizing of misfortune. And Mr.
Glegg was just as fond of saving other people's money as his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own; he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
would have ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) expenses
were to be paid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), as when they were to come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own
pocket, and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent
acquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for blacking. This
inalienable habit of saving, as an end in itself, belonged to the
industrious men of business of a former generation, who made their
fortunes slowly, almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the
harrier,--it constituted them a <div class="bookquote">``race,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fox</b></font>)</div>which is nearly lost in these
days of rapid money-getting, when lavishness comes close on the back
of want. In old-fashioned times an <div class="bookquote">``independence''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>was hardly ever made
without a little miserliness as a condition, and you would have found
that quality in every provincial district, combined with characters as
various as the fruits from which we can extract acid. The true
Harpagons were always marked and exceptional characters; not so the
worthy tax-payers, who, having once pinched from real necessity,
retained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement, with their
wallfruit and wine-bins, the habit of regarding life as an ingenious
process of nibbling out one's livelihood without leaving any
perceptible deficit, and who would have been as immediately prompted
to give up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five
hundred a year, as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital.
Mr. Glegg was one of these men, found so impracticable by chancellors
of the exchequer; and knowing this, you will be the better able to
understand why he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had not swerved from the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had made
an eligible marriage, in spite of the too-pungent seasoning that
nature had given to the eldest Miss Dodson's virtues. A man with an
affectionate disposition, who finds a wife to concur with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fundamental idea of life, easily comes to persuade himself that no
other woman would have suited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so well, and does a little daily
snapping and quarrelling without any sense of alienation. Mr. Glegg,
being of a reflective turn, and no longer occupied with wool, had much
wondering meditation on the peculiar constitution of the female mind
as unfolded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) domestic life; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) thought Mrs.
Glegg's household ways a model for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sex. It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) as a
pitiable irregularity in other women if they did not roll up their
table-napkins with the same tightness and emphasis as Mrs. Glegg did,
if their pastry had a less leathery consistence, and their damson
cheese a less venerable hardness than hers; nay, even the peculiar
combination of grocery and druglike odors in Mrs. Glegg's private
cupboard impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) as the only right thing in the way of cupboard
smells. I am not sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) would not have longed for the
quarrelling again, if it had ceased for an entire week; and it is
certain that an acquiescent, mild wife would have left his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) meditations
comparatively jejune and barren of mystery.

<p/>Mr. Glegg's unmistakable kind-heartedness was shown in this, that it
pained him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) more to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife at variance with others,--even with
Dolly, the servant,--than to be in a state of cavil with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) himself;
and the quarrel between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) and Mr. Tulliver vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) so much that it
quite nullified the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would otherwise have had in the state
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) early cabbages, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) walked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) garden before breakfast the
next morning. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) went in to breakfast with some slight hope
that, now Mrs. Glegg had <div class="bookquote">``slept upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) anger might be subdued
enough to give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) usually strong sense of family decorum. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
had been used to boast that there had never been any of those deadly
quarrels among the Dodsons which had disgraced other families; that no
Dodson had ever been <div class="bookquote">``cut off with a shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodson/Miss Dodson</b></font>)</div>and no cousin of the
Dodsons disowned; as, indeed, why should they be? For they had no
cousins who had not money out at use, or some houses of their own, at
the very least.

<p/>There was one evening-cloud which had always disappeared from Mrs.
Glegg's brow when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sat at the breakfast-table. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) fuzzy
front of curls; for as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) occupied herself in household matters in
the morning it would have been a mere extravagance to put on anything
so superfluous to the making of leathery pastry as a fuzzy curled
front. By half-past ten decorum demanded the front; until then Mrs.
Glegg could economize it, and society would never be any the wiser.
But the absence of that cloud only left it more apparent that the
cloud of severity remained; and Mr. Glegg, perceiving this, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sat
down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) milkporridge, which it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) old frugal habit to stem
his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) morning hunger with, prudently resolved to leave the first remark
to Mrs. Glegg, lest, to so delicate an article as a lady's temper, the
slightest touch should do mischief. People who seem to enjoy their ill
temper have a way of keeping it in fine condition by inflicting
privations on themselves. That was Mrs. Glegg's way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) tea
weaker than usual this morning, and declined butter. It was a hard
case that a vigorous mood for quarrelling, so highly capable of using
an opportunity, should not meet with a single remark from Mr. Glegg on
which to exercise itself. But by and by it appeared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) silence
would answer the purpose, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) heard himself apostrophized at last
in that tone peculiar to the wife of one's bosom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Glegg! it's a poor return I get for making you the wife
I've made you all these years. If this is the way I'm to be treated,
I'd better ha' known it before my poor father died, and then, when I'd
wanted a home, I should ha' gone elsewhere, as the choice was offered
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Glegg paused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) porridge and looked up, not with any new
amazement, but simply with that quiet, habitual wonder with which we
regard constant mysteries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mrs. G., what have I done now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done now, Mr. Glegg? _done now?_--I'm sorry for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Not seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) way to any pertinent answer, Mr. Glegg reverted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
porridge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's husbands in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Glegg, after a pause,
<div class="bookquote">``as `ud have known how to do something different to siding with
everybody else against their own wives. Perhaps I'm wrong and you can
teach me better. But I've allays heard as it's the husband's place to
stand by the wife, instead o' rejoicing and triumphing when folks
insult her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what call have you to say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, rather warmly,
for though a kind man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was not as meek as Moses. <div class="bookquote">``When did I
rejoice or triumph over you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's ways o' doing things worse than speaking out plain, Mr.
Glegg. I'd sooner you'd tell me to my face as you make light of me,
than try to make out as everybody's in the right but me, and come to
your breakfast in the morning, as I've hardly slept an hour this
night, and sulk at me as if I was the dirt under your feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sulk at you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, in a tone of angry facetiousness.
<div class="bookquote">``You're like a tipsy man as thinks everybody's had too much but
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't lower yourself with using coarse language to _me_, Mr. Glegg!
It makes you look very small, though you can't see yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Glegg, in a tone of energetic compassion. <div class="bookquote">``A man in your place
should set an example, and talk more sensible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but will you listen to sense?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Glegg, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``The
best sense I can talk to you is what I said last night,--as you're i'
the wrong to think o' calling in your money, when it's safe enough if
you'd let it alone, all because of a bit of a tiff, and I was in hopes
you'd ha' altered your mind this morning. But if you'd like to call it
in, don't do it in a hurry now, and breed more enmity in the family,
but wait till there's a pretty mortgage to be had without any trouble.
You'd have to set the lawyer to work now to find an investment, and
make no end o' expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Glegg felt there was really something in this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
head and emitted a guttural interjection to indicate that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) silence
was only an armistice, not a peace. And, in fact hostilities soon
broke out again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll thank you for my cup o' tea, now, Mrs. G.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg,
seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) did not proceed to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) as usual, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had
finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) porridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) lifted the teapot with a slight toss of the
head, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to hear you'll _thank_ me, Mr. Glegg. It's little thanks _I_
get for what I do for folks i' this world. Though there's never a
woman o' _your_ side o' the family, Mr. Glegg, as is fit to stand up
with me, and I'd say it if I was on my dying bed. Not but what I've
allays conducted myself civil to your kin, and there isn't one of 'em
can say the contrary, though my equils they aren't, and nobody shall
make me say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better leave finding fault wi' my kin till you've left off
quarrelling with you own, Mrs. G.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, with angry
sarcasm. <div class="bookquote">``I'll trouble you for the milk-jug.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as false a word as ever you spoke, Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady,
pouring out the milk with unusual profuseness, as much as to say, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wanted milk he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) should have it with a vengeance. <div class="bookquote">``And you know it's
false. I'm not the woman to quarrel with my own kin; _you_ may, for
I've known you to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister's
house in a tantrum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd no quarrel wi' my sister, Mr. Glegg, and it's false to say it.
Mr. Tulliver's none o' my blood, and it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) quarrelled with me,
and drove me out o' the house. But perhaps you'd have had me stay and
be swore at, Mr. Glegg; perhaps you was vexed not to hear more abuse
and foul language poured out upo' your own wife. But, let me tell you,
it's _your_ disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did ever anybody hear the like i' this parish?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg,
getting hot. <div class="bookquote">``A woman, with everything provided for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and allowed

I die beyond anything she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could expect--to go on i' this way, biting
and snapping like a mad dog! It's beyond everything, as God A `mighty
should ha' made women _so_.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-These last words were uttered in a tone
of sorrowful agitation. Mr. Glegg pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) tea from him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), and tapped
the table with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) hands.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Glegg, if those are your feelings, it's best they should be
known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) napkin, and folding it in an
excited manner. <div class="bookquote">``But if you talk o' my being provided for beyond what
I could expect, I beg leave to tell you as I'd a right to expect a
many things as I don't find. And as to my being like a mad dog, it's
well if you're not cried shame on by the county for your treatment of
me, for it's what I can't bear, and I won't bear--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mrs. Glegg's voice intimated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was going to cry, and
breaking off from speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) rang the bell violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sally,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) chair, and speaking in rather a
choked voice, <div class="bookquote">``light a fire up-stairs, and put the blinds down. Mr.
Glegg, you'll please to order what you'd like for dinner. I shall have
gruel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Glegg walked across the room to the small book-case, and took
down Baxter's <div class="bookquote">``Saints' Everlasting Rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baxter</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) carried with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
up-stairs. It was the book she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was accustomed to lay open before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
on special occasions,--on wet Sunday mornings, or when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) heard of a
death in the family, or when, as in this case, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) quarrel with Mr.
Glegg had been set an octave higher than usual.

<p/>But Mrs. Glegg carried something else up-stairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), which,
together with the <div class="bookquote">``Saints' Rest''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and the gruel, may have had some
influence in gradually calming her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) feelings, and making it possible
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) to endure existence on the ground-floor, shortly before
tea-time. This was, partly, Mr. Glegg's suggestion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) would do
well to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) five hundred lie still until a good investment turned
up; and, further, his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) parenthetic hint at his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) handsome provision for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) in case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) death. Mr. Glegg, like all men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) stamp, was
extremely reticent about his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) will; and Mrs. Glegg, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) gloomier
moments, had forebodings that, like other husbands of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had
heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) might cherish the mean project of heightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) grief at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) death by leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) poorly off, in which case she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was firmly
resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) would have scarcely any weeper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) bonnet, and
would cry no more than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had been a second husband. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had
really shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) any testamentary tenderness, it would be affecting to
think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), poor man, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was gone; and even his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) foolish fuss
about the flowers and garden-stuff, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) insistence on the subject
of snails, would be touching when it was once fairly at an end. To
survive Mr. Glegg, and talk eulogistically of him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) as a man who might
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) weaknesses, but who had done the right thing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>),
not-withstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) numerous poor relations; to have sums of interest
coming in more frequently, and secrete it in various corners, baffling
to the most ingenious of thieves -LRB-for, to Mrs. Glegg's mind, banks and
strong-boxes would have nullified the pleasure of property; she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) might
as well have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) food in capsules-RRB-; finally, to be looked up to
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own family and the neighborhood, so as no woman can ever hope
to be who has not the præterite and present dignity comprised in being
a <div class="bookquote">``widow well left,'' (<font color='red'><b>no woman</b></font>)</div>--all this made a flattering and conciliatory view
of the future. So that when good Mr. Glegg, restored to good humor by
much hoeing, and moved by the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife's empty chair, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting rolled up in the corner, went up-stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
observed that the bell had been tolling for poor Mr. Morton, Mrs.
Glegg answered magnanimously, quite as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had been an uninjured
woman: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! then, there'll be a good business for somebody to take
to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Baxter had been open at least eight hours by this time, for it was
nearly five o'clock; and if people are to quarrel often, it follows as
a corollary that their quarrels cannot be protracted beyond certain
limits.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Glegg talked quite amicably about the Tullivers that
evening. Mr. Glegg went the length of admitting that Tulliver was a
sad man for getting into hot water, and was like enough to run through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) property; and Mrs. Glegg, meeting this acknowledgment half-way,
declared that it was beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) to take notice of such a man's
conduct, and that, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sister's sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keep the
five hundred a while longer, for when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) put it out on a mortgage she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
should only get four per cent.



<p/>Chapter XIII

<p/>Mr. Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life


<p/>Owing to this new adjustment of Mrs. Glegg's thoughts, Mrs. Pullet
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) task of mediation the next day surprisingly easy. Mrs.
Glegg, indeed checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) rather sharply for thinking it would be
necessary to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) elder sister what was the right mode of behavior
in family matters. Mrs. Pullet's argument, that it would look ill in
the neighborhood if people should have it in their power to say that
there was a quarrel in the family, was particularly offensive. If the
family name never suffered except through Mrs. Glegg, Mrs. Pullet
might lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) pillow in perfect confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not to be expected, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Glegg, by way of
winding up the subject, <div class="bookquote">``as I shall go to the mill again before Bessy
comes to see me, or as I shall go and fall down o' my knees to Mr.
Tulliver, and ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pardon for showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) favors; but I shall bear
no malice, and when Mr. Tulliver speaks civil to me, I'll speak civil
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). Nobody has any call to tell me what's becoming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Finding it unnecessary to plead for the Tullivers, it was natural that
aunt Pullet should relax a little in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) anxiety for them, and recur
to the annoyance she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had suffered yesterday from the offspring of that
apparently ill-fated house. Mrs. Glegg heard a circumstantial
narrative, to which Mr. Pullet's remarkable memory furnished some
items; and while aunt Pullet pitied poor Bessy's bad luck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
children, and expressed a half-formed project of paying for Maggie's
being sent to a distant boarding-school, which would not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
being so brown, but might tend to subdue some other vices in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), aunt
Glegg blamed Bessy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) weakness, and appealed to all witnesses who
should be living when the Tulliver children had turned out ill, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), Mrs. Glegg, had always said how it would be from the very first,
observing that it was wonderful to herself how all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) words came
true.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I may call and tell Bessy you'll bear no malice, and everything
be as it was before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pullet said, just before parting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you may, Sophy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg; <div class="bookquote">``you may tell Mr. Tulliver,
and Bessy too, as I'm not going to behave ill because folks behave ill
to me; I know it's my place, as the eldest, to set an example in every
respect, and I do it. Nobody can say different of me, if they'll keep
to the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Glegg being in this state of satisfaction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own lofty
magnanimity, I leave you to judge what effect was produced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) by
the reception of a short letter from Mr. Tulliver that very evening,
after Mrs. Pullet's departure, informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) needn't trouble
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) mind about her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) five hundred pounds, for it should be paid back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) in the course of the next month at farthest, together with the
interest due thereon until the time of payment. And furthermore, that
Mr. Tulliver had no wish to behave uncivilly to Mrs. Glegg, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
was welcome to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) house whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) liked to come, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) desired no
favors from her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), either for himself or his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) children.

<p/>It was poor Mrs. Tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe, entirely
through that irrepressible hopefulness of hers which led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to expect
that similar causes may at any time produce different results. It had
very often occurred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) experience that Mr. Tulliver had done
something because other people had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not able to do it, or
had pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) supposed inability, or in any other way piqued
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pride; still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) thought to-day, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) came in
to tea that sister Pullet was gone to try and make everything up with
sister Glegg, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) needn't think about paying in the money, it
would give a cheerful effect to the meal. Mr. Tulliver had never
slackened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) resolve to raise the money, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) at once
determined to write a letter to Mrs. Glegg, which should cut off all
possibility of mistake. Mrs. Pullet gone to beg and pray for _him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)_
indeed! Mr. Tulliver did not willingly write a letter, and found the
relation between spoken and written language, briefly known as
spelling, one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world.
Nevertheless, like all fervid writing, the task was done in less time
than usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs. Glegg's,--why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
belonged, like himself, to a generation with whom spelling was a
matter of private judgment.

<p/>Mrs. Glegg did not alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) will in consequence of this letter, and
cut off the Tulliver children from their sixth and seventh share in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) thousand pounds; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) principles. No one must be able
to say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was dead that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had not divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) money
with perfect fairness among her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own kin. In the matter of wills,
personal qualities were subordinate to the great fundamental fact of
blood; and to be determined in the distribution of your property by
caprice, and not make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees of
kinship, was a prospective disgrace that would have embittered her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
life. This had always been a principle in the Dodson family; it was
one form if that sense of honor and rectitude which was a proud
tradition in such families,--a tradition which has been the salt of
our provincial society.

<p/>But though the letter could not shake Mrs. Glegg's principles, it made
the family breach much more difficult to mend; and as to the effect it
produced on Mrs. Glegg's opinion of Mr. Tulliver, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) begged to be
understood from that time forth that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had nothing whatever to say
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) state of mind, apparently, was too corrupt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) to
contemplate it for a moment. It was not until the evening before Tom
went to school, at the beginning of August, that Mrs. Glegg paid a
visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sister Tulliver, sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) gig all the while, and
showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) displeasure by markedly abstaining from all advice and
criticism; for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) sister Deane, <div class="bookquote">``Bessy must bear
the consequence o' having such a husband, though I'm sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deane/Mrs. Deane</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Deane agreed that Bessy was pitiable.

<p/>That evening Tom observed to Maggie: <div class="bookquote">``Oh my! Maggie, aunt Glegg's
beginning to come again; I'm glad I'm going to school. _You'll_ catch
it all now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of Tom's going
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that this playful exultation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seemed very unkind,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cried herself to sleep that night.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver's prompt procedure entailed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) further promptitude in
finding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred
pounds on bond. <div class="bookquote">``It must be no client of Wakem's,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said to himself;
and yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary; not
because Mr. Tulliver's will was feeble, but because external fact was
stronger. Wakem's client was the only convenient person to be found.
Mr. Tulliver had a destiny as well as Œdipus, and in this case
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) might plead, like Œdipus, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) deed was inflicted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
rather than committed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).




<p/>Book II

<p/>_School-Time_



<p/>Chapter I

<p/>Tom's <div class="bookquote">``First Half''


 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom Tulliver's sufferings during the first quarter he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was at King's
Lorton, under the distinguished care of the Rev. Walter Stelling, were
rather severe. At Mr. Jacob's academy life had not presented itself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) as a difficult problem; there were plenty of fellows to play with,
and Tom being good at all active games,--fighting especially,--had
that precedence among them which appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inseparable from the
personality of Tom Tulliver. Mr. Jacobs himself, familiarly known as
Old Goggles, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>) habit of wearing spectacles, imposed no painful
awe; and if it was the property of snuffy old hypocrites like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>) to
write like copperplate and surround their signatures with arabesques,
to spell without forethought, and to spout <div class="bookquote">``my name is Norval''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>without
bungling, Tom, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) part, was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not in danger of those
mean accomplishments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but a substantial man, like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, who used to go hunting
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was younger, and rode a capital black mare,--as pretty a bit
of horse-flesh as ever you saw; Tom had heard what her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) points were a
hundred times. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_ meant to go hunting too, and to be generally
respected. When people were grown up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) considered, nobody inquired
about their writing and spelling; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should be
master of everything, and do just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) liked. It had been very
difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to reconcile himself to the idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
school-time was to be prolonged and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not to be brought up
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's business, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always thought extremely
pleasant; for it was nothing but riding about, giving orders, and
going to market; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought that a clergyman would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a
great many Scripture lessons, and probably make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) learn the Gospel
and Epistle on a Sunday, as well as the Collect. But in the absence of
specific information, it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to imagine that school
and a schoolmaster would be something entirely different from the
academy of Mr. Jacobs. So, not to be at a deficiency, in case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>)
finding genial companions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>) had taken care to carry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>) a small
box of percussion-caps; not that there was anything particular to be
done with them, but they would serve to impress strange boys with a
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>) familiarity with guns. Thus poor Tom, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw very
clearly through Maggie's illusions, was not without illusions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
own, which were to be cruelly dissipated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) enlarged experience at
King's Lorton.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that
life, complicated not only with the Latin grammar but with a new
standard of English pronunciation, was a very difficult business, made
all the more obscure by a thick mist of bashfulness. Tom, as you have
observed, was never an exception among boys for ease of address; but
the difficulty of enunciating a monosyllable in reply to Mr. or Mrs.
Stelling was so great, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) even dreaded to be asked at table
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have more pudding. As to the percussion-caps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
almost resolved, in the bitterness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would throw
them into a neighboring pond; for not only was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the solitary pupil,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began even to have a certain scepticism about guns, and a
general sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) theory of life was undermined. For Mr. Stelling
thought nothing of guns, or horses either, apparently; and yet it was
impossible for Tom to despise Mr. Stelling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had despised Old
Goggles. If there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about
Mr. Stelling, it lay quite beyond Tom's power to detect it; it is only
by a wide comparison of facts that the wisest full-grown man can
distinguish well-rolled barrels from mere supernal thunder.

<p/>Mr. Stelling was a well-sized, broad-chested man, not yet thirty, with
flaxen hair standing erect, and large lightish-gray eyes, which were
always very wide open; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had a sonorous bass voice, and an air of
defiant self-confidence inclining to brazenness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had entered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
career with great vigor, and intended to make a considerable
impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) fellowmen. The Rev. Walter Stelling was not a man
who would remain among the <div class="bookquote">``inferior clergy''  (<font color='red'><b>Stelling a man</b></font>)</div>all his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had a
true British determination to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) way in the world,--as a
schoolmaster, in the first place, for there were capital masterships
of grammar-schools to be had, and Mr. Stelling meant to have one of
them; but as a preacher also, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) meant always to preach in a
striking manner, so as to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) congregation swelled by admirers
from neighboring parishes, and to produce a great sensation whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) took occasional duty for a brother clergyman of minor gifts. The
style of preaching he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had chosen was the extemporaneous, which was
held little short of the miraculous in rural parishes like King's
Lorton. Some passages of Massillon and Bourdaloue, which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knew by
heart, were really very effective when rolled out in Mr. Stelling's
deepest tones; but as comparatively feeble appeals of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) own were
delivered in the same loud and impressive manner, they were often
thought quite as striking by his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) hearers. Mr. Stelling's doctrine was
of no particular school; if anything, it had a tinge of
evangelicalism, for that was <div class="bookquote">``the telling thing''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>just then in the
diocese to which King's Lorton belonged. In short, Mr. Stelling was a
man who meant to rise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) profession, and to rise by merit,
clearly, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had no interest beyond what might be promised by a
problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not yet become Lord
Chancellor. A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions naturally
gets a little into debt at starting; it is not to be expected that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
will live in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate
all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life; and if the few hundreds Mr. Timpson advanced toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
daughter's fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome
furniture, together with a stock of wine, a grand piano, and the
laying out of a superior flower-garden, it followed in the most
rigorous manner, either that these things must be procured by some
other means, or else that the Rev. Mr. Stelling must go without them,
which last alternative would be an absurd procrastination of the
fruits of success, where success was certain. Mr. Stelling was so
broad-chested and resolute that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) felt equal to anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) would
become celebrated by shaking the consciences of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) hearers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
would by and by edit a Greek play, and invent several new readings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
had not yet selected the play, for having been married little more
than two years, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) leisure time had been much occupied with
attentions to Mrs. Stelling; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had told that fine woman what he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
meant to do some day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) felt great confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) husband, as
a man who understood everything of that sort.

<p/>But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver
during this first half-year; for, by a singular coincidence, there had
been some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same
neighborhood and it might further a decision in Mr. Stelling's favor,
if it were understood that young Tulliver, who, Mr. Stelling observed
in conjugal privacy, was rather a rough cub, had made prodigious
progress in a short time. It was on this ground that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was severe
with Tom about his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) lessons; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was clearly a boy whose powers would
never be developed through the medium of the Latin grammar, without
the application of some sternness. Not that Mr. Stelling was a
harsh-tempered or unkind man; quite the contrary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was jocose with
Tom at table, and corrected his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) provincialisms and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deportment in
the most playful manner; but poor Tom was only the more cowed and
confused by this double novelty, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had never been used to jokes
at all like Mr. Stelling's; and for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had
a painful sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was all wrong somehow. When Mr. Stelling said,
as the roast-beef was being uncovered, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Tulliver! which would you
rather decline, roast-beef or the Latin for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>Tom, to whom in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
coolest moments a pun would have been a hard nut, was thrown into a
state of embarrassed alarm that made everything dim to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) except the
feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would rather not have anything to do with Latin; of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Roast-beef,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whereupon there followed much
laughter and some practical joking with the plates, from which Tom
gathered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had in some mysterious way refused beef, and, in
fact, made himself appear <div class="bookquote">``a silly.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could have seen a
fellow-pupil undergo these painful operations and survive them in good
spirits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might sooner have taken them as a matter of course. But
there are two expensive forms of education, either of which a parent
may procure for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) son by sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as solitary pupil to a
clergyman: one is the enjoyment of the reverend gentleman's undivided
neglect; the other is the endurance of the reverend gentleman's
undivided attention. It was the latter privilege for which Mr.
Tulliver paid a high price in Tom's initiatory months at King's
Lorton.

<p/>That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind, and driven
homeward in a state of great mental satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) considered that
it was a happy moment for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had thought of asking Riley's
advice about a tutor for Tom. Mr. Stelling's eyes were so wide open,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) talked in such an off-hand, matter-of-fact way, answering every
difficult, slow remark of Mr. Tulliver's with, <div class="bookquote">``I see, my good sir, I
see'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>; <div class="bookquote">``To be sure, to be sure'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>; <div class="bookquote">``You want your son to be a man who
will make his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) way in the world,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>--that Mr. Tulliver was delighted to
find in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) a clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the
every-day affairs of this life. Except Counsellor Wylde, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
heard at the last sessions, Mr. Tulliver thought the Rev. Mr Stelling
was the shrewdest fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had ever met with,--not unlike Wylde, in
fact; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had the same way of sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) thumbs in the armholes of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) waistcoat. Mr. Tulliver was not by any means an exception in
mistaking brazenness for shrewdness; most laymen thought Stelling
shrewd, and a man of remarkable powers generally; it was chiefly by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) clerical brethren that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was considered rather a full fellow. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) told Mr. Tulliver several stories about <div class="bookquote">``Swing''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>and incendiarism,
and asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) advice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and
judicious a manner, with so much polished glibness of tongue, that the
miller thought, here was the very thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wanted for Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had no
doubt this first-rate man was acquainted with every branch of
information, and knew exactly what Tom must learn in order to become a
match for the lawyers, which poor Mr. Tulliver himself did _not_ know,
and so was necessarily thrown for self-direction on this wide kind of
inference. It is hardly fair to laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), for I have known much
more highly instructed persons than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) make inferences quite as wide,
and not at all wiser.

<p/>As for Mrs. Tulliver, finding that Mrs. Stelling's views as to the
airing of linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy
entirely coincided with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own; moreover, that Mrs. Stelling, though
so young a woman, and only anticipating her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) second confinement, had
gone through very nearly the same experience as herself with regard to
the behavior and fundamental character of the monthly nurse,--she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
expressed great contentment to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) husband, when they drove away, at
leaving Tom with a woman who, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) youth, seemed quite
sensible and motherly, and asked advice as prettily as could be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They must be very well off, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``for
everything's as nice as can be all over the house, and that watered
silk she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) had on cost a pretty penny. Sister Pullet has got one like
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)'s got some income besides the curacy, I
reckon. Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) father allows 'em something. There's Tom `ull be
another hundred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and not much trouble either, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own
account; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says teaching comes natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). That's wonderful,
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Tulliver, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head on one side, and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
horse a meditative tickling on the flank.

<p/>Perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to Mr. Stelling, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) set about it with that uniformity of method and independence of
circumstances which distinguish the actions of animals understood to
be under the immediate teaching of nature. Mr. Broderip's amiable
beaver, as that charming naturalist tells us, busied himself as
earnestly in constructing a dam, in a room up three pair of stairs in
London, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had been laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) foundation in a stream or lake in
Upper Canada. It was <div class="bookquote">``Binny's''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>function to build; the absence of water
or of possible progeny was an accident for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was not
accountable. With the same unerring instinct Mr. Stelling set to work
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) natural method of instilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid into
the mind of Tom Tulliver. This, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) considered, was the only basis of
solid instruction; all other means of education were mere
charlatanism, and could produce nothing better than smatterers. Fixed
on this firm basis, a man might observe the display of various or
special knowledge made by irregularly educated people with a pitying
smile; all that sort of thing was very well, but it was impossible
these people could form sound opinions. In holding this conviction Mr.
Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors have been, by the excessive
accuracy or extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) own scholarship; and as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) views about
Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from personal partiality. Mr.
Stelling was very far from being led astray by enthusiasm, either
religious or intellectual; on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had no secret belief
that everything was humbug. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) thought religion was a very excellent
thing, and Aristotle a great authority, and deaneries and prebends
useful institutions, and Great Britain the providential bulwark of
Protestantism, and faith in the unseen a great support to afflicted
minds; he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) believed in all these things, as a Swiss hotel-keeper
believes in the beauty of the scenery around him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>), and in the pleasure
it gives to artistic visitors. And in the same way Mr. Stelling
believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) method of education; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was doing
the very best thing for Mr. Tulliver's boy. Of course, when the miller
talked of <div class="bookquote">``mapping''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``summing''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>in a vague and diffident manner, Mr
Stelling had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) mind at rest by an assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) understood
what was wanted; for how was it possible the good man could form any
reasonable judgment about the matter? Mr Stelling's duty was to teach
the lad in the only right way,--indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) knew no other; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had not
wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) time in the acquirement of anything abnormal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad; for though
by hard labor he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could get particular declensions into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brain,
anything so abstract as the relation between cases and terminations
could by no means get such a lodgment there as to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to
recognize a chance genitive or dative. This struck Mr. Stelling as
something more than natural stupidity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) suspected obstinacy, or at
any rate indifference, and lectured Tom severely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) want of
thorough application. <div class="bookquote">``You feel no interest in what you're doing,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>Mr. Stelling would say, and the reproach was painfully true. Tom
had never found any difficulty in discerning a pointer from a setter,
when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been told the distinction, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) perceptive powers
were not at all deficient. I fancy they were quite as strong as those
of the Rev. Mr. Stelling; for Tom could predict with accuracy what
number of horses were cantering behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) could throw a stone
right into the centre of a given ripple, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) could guess to a fraction
how many lengths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) stick it would take to reach across the
playground, and could draw almost perfect squares on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) slate without
any measurement. But Mr. Stelling took no note of these things; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
only observed that Tom's faculties failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) before the abstractions
hideously symbolized to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) in the pages of the Eton Grammar, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was in a state bordering on idiocy with regard to the demonstration
that two given triangles must be equal, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) could discern with
great promptitude and certainty the fact that they _were_ equal.
Whence Mr. Stelling concluded that Tom's brain, being peculiarly
impervious to etymology and demonstrations, was peculiarly in need of
being ploughed and harrowed by these patent implements; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
favorite metaphor, that the classics and geometry constituted that
culture of the mind which prepared it for the reception of any
subsequent crop. I say nothing against Mr. Stelling's theory; if we
are to have one regimen for all minds, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) seems to me as good as any
other. I only know it turned out as uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had been plied with cheese in order to remedy a gastric weakness
which prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) from digesting it. It is astonishing what a
different result one gets by changing the metaphor! Once call the
brain an intellectual stomach, and one's ingenious conception of the
classics and geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to settle nothing.
But then it is open to some one else to follow great authorities, and
call the mind a sheet of white paper or a mirror, in which case one's
knowledge of the digestive process becomes quite irrelevant. It was
doubtless an ingenious idea to call the camel the ship of the desert,
but it would hardly lead one far in training that useful beast. O
Aristotle! if you had had the advantage of being <div class="bookquote">``the freshest modern''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>instead of the greatest ancient, would you not have mingled your
praise of metaphorical speech, as a sign of high intelligence, with a
lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows itself in speech without
metaphor,--that we can so seldom declare what a thing is, except by
saying it is something else?

<p/>Tom Tulliver, being abundant in no form of speech, did not use any
metaphor to declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) views as to the nature of Latin; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) never
called it an instrument of torture; and it was not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had got on
some way in the next half-year, and in the Delectus, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was
advanced enough to call it a <div class="bookquote">``bore''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``beastly stuff.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At present,
in relation to this demand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should learn Latin declensions and
conjugations, Tom was in a state of as blank unimaginativeness
concerning the cause and tendency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sufferings, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been
an innocent shrewmouse imprisoned in the split trunk of an ash-tree in
order to cure lameness in cattle. It is doubtless almost incredible to
instructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve, not
belonging strictly to <div class="bookquote">``the masses,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>who are now understood to have the
monopoly of mental darkness, should have had no distinct idea how
there came to be such a thing as Latin on this earth; yet so it was
with Tom. It would have taken a long while to make conceivable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
that there ever existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen,
and transacted the every-day affairs of life, through the medium of
this language; and still longer to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) understand why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should
be called upon to learn it, when its connection with those affairs had
become entirely latent. So far as Tom had gained any acquaintance with
the Romans at Mr. Jacob's academy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knowledge was strictly correct,
but it went no farther than the fact that they were <div class="bookquote">``in the New
Testament'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jacob/Jacob</b></font>)</div>; and Mr. Stelling was not the man to enfeeble and
emasculate his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) pupil's mind by simplifying and explaining, or to
reduce the tonic effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering,
extraneous information, such as is given to girls.

<p/>Yet, strange to say, under this vigorous treatment Tom became more
like a girl than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had ever been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a large
share of pride, which had hitherto found itself very comfortable in
the world, despising Old Goggles, and reposing in the sense of
unquestioned rights; but now this same pride met with nothing but
bruises and crushings. Tom was too clear-sighted not to be aware that
Mr. Stelling's standard of things was quite different, was certainly
something higher in the eyes of the world than that of the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had been living amongst, and that, brought in contact with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Tom
Tulliver, appeared uncouth and stupid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was by no means indifferent
to this, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pride got into an uneasy condition which quite
nullified his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) boyish self-satisfaction, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) something of the
girl's susceptibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was a very firm, not to say obstinate,
disposition, but there was no brute-like rebellion and recklessness in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) nature; the human sensibilities predominated, and if it had
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could enable himself to show some quickness at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lessons, and so acquire Mr. Stelling's approbation, by standing on
one leg for an inconvenient length of time, or rapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) head
moderately against the wall, or any voluntary action of that sort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
would certainly have tried it. But no; Tom had never heard that these
measures would brighten the understanding, or strengthen the verbal
memory; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not given to hypothesis and experiment. It did
occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could perhaps get some help by praying for it;
but as the prayers he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said every evening were forms learned by heart,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rather shrank from the novelty and irregularity of introducing an
extempore passage on a topic of petition for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not aware of
any precedent. But one day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had broken down, for the fifth
time, in the supines of the third conjugation, and Mr. Stelling,
convinced that this must be carelessness, since it transcended the
bounds of possible stupidity, had lectured him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) very seriously,
pointing out that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) failed to seize the present golden opportunity
of learning supines, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) would have to regret it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) became a
man,--Tom, more miserable than usual, determined to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sole
resource; and that evening, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) usual form of prayer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
parents and <div class="bookquote">``little sister''  (<font color='red'><b>parents sister</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had begun to pray for Maggie when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was a baby-RRB-, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might be able always to keep God's
commandments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, in the same low whisper, <div class="bookquote">``and please to make
me always remember my Latin.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paused a little to consider how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
should pray about Euclid--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should ask to see what it meant,
or whether there was any other mental state which would be more
applicable to the case. But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``And make Mr. Stelling
say I sha'n't do Euclid any more. Amen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) supines without mistake the next day,
encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to persevere in this appendix to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prayers, and
neutralized any scepticism that might have arisen from Mr. Stelling's
continued demand for Euclid. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) faith broke down under the
apparent absence of all help when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) got into the irregular verbs. It
seemed clear that Tom's despair under the caprices of the present
tense did not constitute a _nodus_ worthy of interference, and since
this was the climax of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) difficulties, where was the use of praying
for help any longer? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind to this conclusion in one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dull, lonely evenings, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spent in the study, preparing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
lessons for the morrow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes were apt to get dim over the page,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hated crying, and was ashamed of it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't help
thinking with some affection even of Spouncer, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) used to fight
and quarrel with; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have felt at home with Spouncer, and in a
condition of superiority. And then the mill, and the river, and Yap
pricking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) ears, ready to obey the least sign when Tom said,
<div class="bookquote">``Hoigh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>would all come before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in a sort of calenture, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
fingers played absently in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) great knife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
coil of whipcord, and other relics of the past.

<p/>Tom, as I said, had never been so much like a girl in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life before,
and at that epoch of irregular verbs his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spirit was further depressed
by a new means of mental development which had been thought of for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
out of school hours. Mrs. Stelling had lately had her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) second baby, and
as nothing could be more salutary for a boy than to feel himself
useful, Mrs. Stelling considered she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was doing Tom a service by
setting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to watch the little cherub Laura while the nurse was
occupied with the sickly baby. It was quite a pretty employment for
Tom to take little Laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day;
it would help to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feel that Lorton Parsonage was a home for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was one of the family. The little cherub Laura, not
being an accomplished walker at present, had a ribbon fastened round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) waist, by which Tom held her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had been a little dog
during the minutes in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) chose to walk; but as these were rare,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was for the most part carrying this fine child round and round the
garden, within sight of Mrs. Stelling's window, according to orders.
If any one considers this unfair and even oppressive toward Tom, I beg
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to consider that there are feminine virtues which are with
difficulty combined, even if they are not incompatible. When the wife
of a poor curate contrives, under all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) disadvantages, to dress
extremely well, and to have a style of coiffure which requires that
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nurse shall occasionally officiate as lady's-maid; when, moreover,
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dinner-parties and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drawing-room show that effort at elegance
and completeness of appointment to which ordinary women might imagine
a large income necessary, it would be unreasonable to expect of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should employ a second nurse, or even act as a nurse herself.
Mr. Stelling knew better; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) wife did wonders already,
and was proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). It was certainly not the best thing in the world
for young Tulliver's gait to carry a heavy child, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had plenty of
exercise in long walks with himself, and next half-year Mr. Stelling
would see about having a drilling-master. Among the many means whereby
Mr. Stelling intended to be more fortunate than the bulk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
fellow-men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had entirely given up that of having his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) own way in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
own house. What then? He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had married <div class="bookquote">``as kind a little soul as ever
breathed,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>according to Mr. Riley, who had been acquainted with Mrs.
Stelling's blond ringlets and smiling demeanor throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) maiden
life, and on the strength of that knowledge would have been ready any
day to pronounce that whatever domestic differences might arise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
married life must be entirely Mr. Stelling's fault.

<p/>If Tom had had a worse disposition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would certainly have hated the
little cherub Laura, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was too kind-hearted a lad for that; there
was too much in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) of the fibre that turns to true manliness, and to
protecting pity for the weak. I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hated Mrs. Stelling, and
contracted a lasting dislike to pale blond ringlets and broad plaits,
as directly associated with haughtiness of manner, and a frequent
reference to other people's <div class="bookquote">``duty.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't help playing with
little Laura, and liking to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) even sacrificed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
percussion-caps for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sake, in despair of their ever serving a
greater purpose,--thinking the small flash and bang would delight her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>),
and thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from Mrs. Stelling for
teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) child to play with fire. Laura was a sort of
playfellow--and oh, how Tom longed for playfellows! In his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) secret
heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) yearned to have Maggie with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and was almost ready to dote
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) exasperating acts of forgetfulness; though, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was at
home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) always represented it as a great favor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) part to let
Maggie trot by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pleasure excursions.

<p/>And before this dreary half-year was ended, Maggie actually came. Mrs.
Stelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come
and stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) brother; so when Mr. Tulliver drove over to King's
Lorton late in October, Maggie came too, with the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
taking a great journey, and beginning to see the world. It was Mr.
Tulliver's first visit to see Tom, for the lad must learn not to think
too much about home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said to Tom, when Mr. Stelling had left the room to
announce the arrival to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) wife, and Maggie had begun to kiss Tom
freely, <div class="bookquote">``you look rarely! School agrees with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had looked rather ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I _am_ well, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd ask Mr.

think.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Euclid, my lad,--why, what's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know; it's definitions, and axioms, and triangles, and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, reprovingly; <div class="bookquote">``you mustn't say so. You

you to learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I'll_ help you now, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with a little air of
patronizing consolation. <div class="bookquote">``I'm come to stay ever so long, if Mrs.
Stelling asks me. I've brought my box and my pinafores, haven't I,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ help me, you silly little thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in such high
spirits at this announcement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) quite enjoyed the idea of
confounding Maggie by showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a page of Euclid. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to
see you doing one of _my_ lessons! Why, I learn Latin too! Girls never
learn such things. They're too silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what Latin is very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, confidently, <div class="bookquote">``Latin's a
language. There are Latin words in the Dictionary. There's bonus, a
gift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you're just wrong there, Miss Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, secretly
astonished. ``You think you're very wise! But `bonus' means ``good,<div class="bookquote">'' as
it happens,--bonus, bona, bonum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's no reason why it shouldn't mean `gift,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
stoutly. ``It may mean several things; almost every word does. There's
``lawn,'--i<div class="bookquote">'' means the grass-plot, as well as the stuff
pocket-handkerchiefs are made of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, little `un,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt
rather disgusted with Maggie's knowingness, though beyond measure
cheerful at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was going to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
conceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) books.

<p/>Mrs. Stelling, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) pressing invitation, did not mention a longer
time than a week for Maggie's stay; but Mr. Stelling, who took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) knees, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stole her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dark eyes from,
insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must stay a fortnight. Maggie thought Mr. Stelling
was a charming man, and Mr. Tulliver was quite proud to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
little wench where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have an opportunity of showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
cleverness to appreciating strangers. So it was agreed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should
not be fetched home till the end of the fortnight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, come with me into the study, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, as their
father drove away. <div class="bookquote">``What do you shake and toss your head now for, you
silly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) continued; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair was now under a new
dispensation, and was brushed smoothly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemed
still in imagination to be tossing it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It makes you
look as if you were crazy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Don't tease me, Tom.
Oh, what books!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) exclaimed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw the bookcases in the study.
<div class="bookquote">``How I should like to have as many books as that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you couldn't read one of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, triumphantly. <div class="bookquote">``They're
all Latin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they aren't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. ``I can read the back of
this,--<div class="bookquote">``History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what does that mean? _You_ don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I could soon find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should look inside, and see what it was about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better not, Miss Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand on the
volume. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Stelling lets nobody touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) books without leave, and
_I_ shall catch it, if you take it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well. Let me see all _your_ books, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
turning to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms round Tom's neck, and rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cheek with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
small round nose.

<p/>Tom, in the gladness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute
with and crow over again, seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) round the waist, and began to
jump with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) round the large library table. Away they jumped with
more and more vigor, till Maggie's hair flew from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ears, and
twirled about like an animated mop. But the revolutions round the
table became more and more irregular in their sweep, till at last
reaching Mr. Stelling's reading stand, they sent it thundering down
with its heavy lexicons to the floor. Happily it was the ground-floor,
and the study was a one-storied wing to the house, so that the
downfall made no alarming resonance, though Tom stood dizzy and aghast
for a few minutes, dreading the appearance of Mr. or Mrs. Stelling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom at last, lifting up the stand, <div class="bookquote">``we must
keep quiet here, you know. If we break anything Mrs. Stelling'll make
us cry peccavi.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's the Latin for a good scolding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, not without some
pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knowledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) a cross woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with an emphatic nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think all women are crosser than men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Glegg's a
great deal crosser than uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more than
father does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, _you'll_ be a woman some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``so _you_ needn't
talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall be a _clever_ woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with a toss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dare say, and a nasty conceited thing. Everybody'll hate you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you oughtn't to hate me, Tom; it'll be very wicked of you, for I
shall be your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but if you're a nasty disagreeable thing I _shall_ hate you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but, Tom, you won't! I sha'n't be disagreeable. I shall be very
good to you, and I shall be good to everybody. You won't hate me
really, will you, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother! never mind! Come, it's time for me to learn my lessons.
See here! what I've got to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, drawing Maggie toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
and showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) theorem, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
ears, and prepared herself to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) capability of helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in
Euclid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to read with full confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own powers, but
presently, becoming quite bewildered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face flushed with
irritation. It was unavoidable; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) incompetency, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not fond of humiliation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and very ugly stuff; nobody need want to
make it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there, now, Miss Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, drawing the book away, and
wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You see you're not so clever as you thought
you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, pouting, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say I could make it out, if I'd
learned what goes before, as you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's what you just couldn't, Miss Wisdom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``For it's
all the harder when you know what goes before; for then you've got to
say what definition 3 is, and what axiom V. is. But get along with you
now; I must go on with this. Here's the Latin Grammar. See what you
can make of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mathematical
mortification; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) delighted in new words, and quickly found that
there was an English Key at the end, which would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) very wise
about Latin, at slight expense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presently made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind to skip
the rules in the Syntax, the examples became so absorbing. These
mysterious sentences, snatched from an unknown context,--like strange
horns of beasts, and leaves of unknown plants, brought from some
far-off region,--gave boundless scope to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination, and were all
the more fascinating because they were in a peculiar tongue of their
own, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could learn to interpret. It was really very
interesting, the Latin Grammar that Tom had said no girls could learn;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was proud because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found it interesting. The most
fragmentary examples were her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) favourites. _Mors omnibus est communis_
would have been jejune, only she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) liked to know the Latin; but the
fortunate gentleman whom every one congratulated because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a son
<div class="bookquote">``endowed with _such_ a disposition''  (<font color='red'><b>a son</b></font>)</div>afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a great deal of
pleasant conjecture, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was quite lost in the <div class="bookquote">``thick grove
penetrable by no star,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when Tom called out,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, Magsie, give us the Grammar!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, it's such a pretty book!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) jumped out of the
large arm-chair to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it's much prettier than the
Dictionary. I could learn Latin very soon. I don't think it's at all
hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know what you've been doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``you've been reading
the English at the end. Any donkey can do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business-like
air, as much as to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a lesson to learn which no donkeys
would find themselves equal to. Maggie, rather piqued, turned to the
bookcases to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles.

<p/>Presently Tom called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Here, Magsie, come and hear if I can say
this. Stand at that end of the table, where Mr. Stelling sits when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
hears me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie obeyed, and took the open book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you begin, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, I begin at _``Appellativa arborum,<div class="bookquote">''_ because I say all over again
what I've been learning this week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom sailed along pretty well for three lines; and Maggie was beginning
to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) office of prompter in speculating as to what _mas_ could
mean, which came twice over, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stuck fast at _Sunt etiam
volucrum_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me, Maggie; _Sunt etiam volucrum_--_Sunt etiam
volucrum_--_ut ostrea, cetus_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mouth and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Sunt etiam volucrum_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Tom, very slowly, as if the next words
might be expected to come sooner when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gave them this strong hint
that they were waited for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C, e, u,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, getting impatient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know--hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">''_Ceu passer, hirundo;
Ferarum_--_ferarum_--''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pencil and made several hard
dots with it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) book-cover--<div class="bookquote">''_ferarum_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, oh dear, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``what a time you are! _Ut_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Ut ostrea_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">''_ut tigris_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, now I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``it was _tigris, vulpes_, I'd
forgotten: _ut tigris, volupes; et Piscium_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>With some further stammering and repetition, Tom got through the next
few lines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the next is what I've just learned for
to-morrow. Give me hold of the book a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After some whispered gabbling, assisted by the beating of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fist on
the table, Tom returned the book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Mascula nomina in a_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``that doesn't come next. It's _Nomen non
creskens genittivo_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Creskens genittivo!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Tom, with a derisive laugh, for Tom
had learned this omitted passage for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) yesterday's lesson, and a
young gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive acquaintance
with Latin before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false
quantity. <div class="bookquote">''_Creskens genittivo!_ What a little silly you are, Maggie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you needn't laugh, Tom, for you didn't remember it at all. I'm
sure it's spelt so; how was I to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phee-e-e-h! I told you girls couldn't learn Latin. It's _Nomen non
crescens genitivo_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, pouting. <div class="bookquote">``I can say that as well as you
can. And you don't mind your stops. For you ought to stop twice as
long at a semicolon as you do at a comma, and you make the longest
stops where there ought to be no stop at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, don't chatter. Let me go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>They were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the
drawing-room, and Maggie became so animated with Mr. Stelling, who,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt sure, admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cleverness, that Tom was rather amazed and
alarmed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) audacity. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was suddenly subdued by Mr.
Stelling's alluding to a little girl of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
once ran away to the gypsies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a very odd little girl that must be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Stelling,
meaning to be playful; but a playfulness that turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) supposed
oddity was not at all to Maggie's taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feared that Mr. Stelling,
after all, did not think much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and went to bed in rather low
spirits. Mrs. Stelling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) felt, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)
hair was very ugly because it hung down straight behind.

<p/>Nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie, this visit to
Tom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was allowed to be in the study while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lessons, and
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) various readings got very deep into the examples in the Latin
Grammar. The astronomer who hated women generally caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so much
puzzling speculation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) one day asked Mr. Stelling if all
astronomers hated women, or whether it was only this particular
astronomer. But forestalling his (<font color='blue'><b>astronomer</b></font>) answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's all astronomers; because, you know, they live up in
high towers, and if the women came there they might talk and hinder
them from looking at the stars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Stelling liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) prattle immensely, and they were on the best
terms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) told Tom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should like to go to school to Mr. Stelling,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) did, and learn just the same things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could do
Euclid, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had looked into it again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw what A B C
meant; they were the names of the lines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you couldn't do it, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``and I'll just ask Mr.
Stelling if you could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minx</b></font>)</div>said the little conceited minx, <div class="bookquote">``I'll ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the minx</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Stelling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, that same evening when they were in the
drawing-room, <div class="bookquote">``couldn't I do Euclid, and all Tom's lessons, if you
were to teach me instead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``Girls can't do Euclid; can
they, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They can pick up a little of everything, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Stelling. <div class="bookquote">``They've a great deal of superficial cleverness; but they
couldn't go far into anything. They're quick and shallow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, delighted with this verdict, telegraphed his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) triumph by wagging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) head at Maggie, behind Mr. Stelling's chair. As for Maggie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had hardly ever been so mortified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been so proud to be called
<div class="bookquote">``quick''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) little life, and now it appeared that this quickness
was the brand of inferiority. It would have been better to be slow,
like Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha! Miss Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, when they were alone; <div class="bookquote">``you see it's
not such a fine thing to be quick. You'll never go far into anything,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>And Maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no
spirit for a retort.

<p/>But when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away in
the gig by Luke, and the study was once more quite lonely for Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) grievously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had really been brighter, and had got
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lessons better, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been there; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
asked Mr. Stelling so many questions about the Roman Empire, and
whether there really ever was a man who said, in Latin, <div class="bookquote">``I would not
buy it for a farthing or a rotten nut,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>or whether that had only been
turned into Latin, that Tom had actually come to a dim understanding
of the fact that there had once been people upon the earth who were so
fortunate as to know Latin without learning it through the medium of
the Eton Grammar. This luminous idea was a great addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
historical acquirements during this half-year, which were otherwise
confined to an epitomized history of the Jews.

<p/>But the dreary half-year _did_ come to an end. How glad Tom was to see
the last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind! The dark
afternoons and the first December snow seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) far livelier than
the August sunshine; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might make himself the surer about
the flight of the days that were carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) homeward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stuck
twenty-one sticks deep in a corner of the garden, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was three
weeks from the holidays, and pulled one up every day with a great
wrench, throwing it to a distance with a vigor of will which would
have carried it to limbo, if it had been in the nature of sticks to
travel so far.

<p/>But it was worth purchasing, even at the heavy price of the Latin
Grammar, the happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlor at
home, as the gig passed noiselessly over the snow-covered bridge; the
happiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses
and the smiles of that familiar hearth, where the pattern of the rug
and the grate and the fire-irons were <div class="bookquote">``first ideas''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that it was no
more possible to criticise than the solidity and extension of matter.
There is no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those scenes where
we were born, where objects became dear to us before we had known the
labor of choice, and where the outer world seemed only an extension of
our own personality; we accepted and loved it as we accepted our own
sense of existence and our own limbs. Very commonplace, even ugly,
that furniture of our early home might look if it were put up to
auction; an improved taste in upholstery scorns it; and is not the
striving after something better and better in our surroundings the
grand characteristic that distinguishes man from the brute, or, to
satisfy a scrupulous accuracy of definition, that distinguishes the
British man from the foreign brute? But heaven knows where that
striving might lead us, if our affections had not a trick of twining
round those old inferior things; if the loves and sanctities of our
life had no deep immovable roots in memory. One's delight in an
elderberry bush overhanging the confused leafage of a hedgerow bank,
as a more gladdening sight than the finest cistus or fuchsia spreading
itself on the softest undulating turf, is an entirely unjustifiable
preference to a nursery-gardener, or to any of those regulated minds
who are free from the weakness of any attachment that does not rest on
a demonstrable superiority of qualities. And there is no better reason
for preferring this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early
memory; that it is no novelty in my life, speaking to me merely
through my present sensibilities to form and color, but the long
companion of my existence, that wove itself into my joys when joys
were vivid.



<p/>Chapter II

<p/>The Christmas Holidays


<p/>Fine old Christmas, with the snowy hair and ruddy face, had done his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
duty that year in the noblest fashion, and had set off his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) rich gifts
of warmth and color with all the heightening contrast of frost and
snow.

<p/>Snow lay on the croft and river-bank in undulations softer than the
limbs of infancy; it lay with the neatliest finished border on every
sloping roof, making the dark-red gables stand out with a new depth of
color; it weighed heavily on the laurels and fir-trees, till it fell
from them with a shuddering sound; it clothed the rough turnip-field
with whiteness, and made the sheep look like dark blotches; the gates
were all blocked up with the sloping drifts, and here and there a
disregarded four-footed beast stood as if petrified <div class="bookquote">``in unrecumbent
sadness'' (<font color='red'><b>Snow</b></font>)</div>; there was no gleam, no shadow, for the heavens, too, were
one still, pale cloud; no sound or motion in anything but the dark
river that flowed and moaned like an unresting sorrow. But old
Christmas smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) laid this cruel-seeming spell on the outdoor
world, for he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) meant to light up home with new brightness, to deepen
all the richness of indoor color, and give a keener edge of delight to
the warm fragrance of food; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) meant to prepare a sweet imprisonment
that would strengthen the primitive fellowship of kindred, and make
the sunshine of familiar human faces as welcome as the hidden
day-star. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kindness fell but hardly on the homeless,--fell but
hardly on the homes where the hearth was not very warm, and where the
food had little fragrance; where the human faces had had no sunshine
in them, but rather the leaden, blank-eyed gaze of unexpectant want.
But the fine old season meant well; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has not learned the
secret how to bless men impartially, it is because his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father Time,
with ever-unrelenting unrelenting purpose, still hides that secret in
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own mighty, slow-beating heart.

<p/>And yet this Christmas day, in spite of Tom's fresh delight in home,
was not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, somehow or other, quite so happy as it had always
been before. The red berries were just as abundant on the holly, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Maggie had dressed all the windows and mantlepieces and
picture-frames on Christmas eve with as much taste as ever, wedding
the thick-set scarlet clusters with branches of the black-berried ivy.
There had been singing under the windows after midnight,--supernatural
singing, Maggie always felt, in spite of Tom's contemptuous insistence
that the singers were old Patch, the parish clerk, and the rest of the
church choir; she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) trembled with awe when their carolling broke in upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) dreams, and the image of men in fustian clothes was always thrust
away by the vision of angels resting on the parted cloud. The midnight
chant had helped as usual to lift the morning above the level of
common days; and then there were the smell of hot toast and ale from
the kitchen, at the breakfast hour; the favorite anthem, the green
boughs, and the short sermon gave the appropriate festal character to
the church-going; and aunt and uncle Moss, with all their seven
children, were looking like so many reflectors of the bright
parlor-fire, when the church-goers came back, stamping the snow from
their feet. The plum-pudding was of the same handsome roundness as
ever, and came in with the symbolic blue flames around it, as if it
had been heroically snatched from the nether fires, into which it had
been thrown by dyspeptic Puritans; the dessert was as splendid as
ever, with its golden oranges, brown nuts, and the crystalline light
and dark of apple-jelly and damson cheese; in all these things
Christmas was as it had always been since Tom could remember; it was
only distinguished, if by anything, by superior sliding and snowballs.

<p/>Christmas was cheery, but not so Mr. Tulliver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was irate and
defiant; and Tom, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) espoused his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's quarrels and shared
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's sense of injury, was not without some of the feeling that
oppressed Maggie when Mr. Tulliver got louder and more angry in
narration and assertion with the increased leisure of dessert. The
attention that Tom might have concentrated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nuts and wine was
distracted by a sense that there were rascally enemies in the world,
and that the business of grown-up life could hardly be conducted
without a good deal of quarrelling. Now, Tom was not fond of
quarrelling, unless it could soon be put an end to by a fair stand-up
fight with an adversary whom he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) had every chance of thrashing; and his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>)
father's irritable talk made him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) uncomfortable, though he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) never
accounted to himself for the feeling, or conceived the notion that his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>)
father was faulty in this respect.

<p/>The particular embodiment of the evil principle now exciting Mr.
Tulliver's determined resistance was Mr. Pivart, who, having lands
higher up the Ripple, was taking measures for their irrigation, which
either were, or would be, or were bound to be -LRB-on the principle that
water was water-RRB-, an infringement on Mr. Tulliver's legitimate share
of water-power. Dix, who had a mill on the stream, was a feeble
auxiliary of Old Harry compared with Pivart. Dix had been brought to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dix</b></font>) senses by arbitration, and Wakem's advice had not carried _him (<font color='blue'><b>Dix</b></font>)_
far. No; Dix, Mr. Tulliver considered, had been as good as nowhere in
point of law; and in the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) indignation against Pivart,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) contempt for a baffled adversary like Dix began to wear the air of
a friendly attachment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dix</b></font>) had no male audience to-day except Mr. Moss,
who knew nothing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) said, of the <div class="bookquote">``natur' o' mills,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and could only
assent to Mr. Tulliver's arguments on the _a priori_ ground of family
relationship and monetary obligation; but Mr. Tulliver did not talk
with the futile intention of convincing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) audience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) talked to
relieve himself; while good Mr. Moss made strong efforts to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)
eyes wide open, in spite of the sleepiness which an unusually good
dinner produced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) hard-worked frame. Mrs. Moss, more alive to the
subject, and interested in everything that affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) brother,
listened and put in a word as often as maternal preoccupations
allowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Pivart's a new name hereabout, brother, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pivart</b></font>)
didn't own the land in father's time, nor yours either, before I was
married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``New name? Yes, I should think it _is_ a new name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver,
with angry emphasis. ``Dorlcote Mill's been in our family a hundred
year and better, and nobody ever heard of a Pivart meddling with the
river, till this fellow came and bought Bincome's farm out of hand,
before anybody else could so much as say ``snap.<div class="bookquote">'' But I'll _Pivart_
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Tulliver, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) glass with a sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
defined his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) resolution in an unmistakable manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't be forced to go to law with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), I hope, brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Moss, with some anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I shall be forced to; but I know what I shall force
_him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)_ to, with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dikes and erigations, if there's any law to be
brought to bear o' the right side. I know well enough who's at the
bottom of it; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s got Wakem to back him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and egg him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on. I know Wakem
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) the law can't touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) for it, but there's folks can handle
the law besides Wakem. It takes a big raskil to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>); but there's
bigger to be found, as know more o' th' ins and outs o' the law, else
how came Wakem to lose Brumley's suit for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver was a strictly honest man, and proud of being honest, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) considered that in law the ends of justice could only be achieved
by employing a stronger knave to frustrate a weaker. Law was a sort of
cock-fight, in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a
game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gore's no fool; you needn't tell me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) observed presently, in
a pugnacious tone, as if poor Gritty had been urging that lawyer's
capabilities; <div class="bookquote">``but, you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) isn't up to the law as Wakem is. And
water's a very particular thing; you can't pick it up with a
pitchfork. That's why it's been nuts to Old Harry and the lawyers.
It's plain enough what's the rights and the wrongs of water, if you
look at it straight-forrard; for a river's a river, and if you've got
a mill, you must have water to turn it; and it's no use telling me
Pivart's erigation and nonsense won't stop my wheel; I know what
belongs to water better than that. Talk to me o' what th' engineers
say! I say it's common sense, as Pivart's dikes must do me an injury.
But if that's their engineering, I'll put Tom to it by-and-by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
shall see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can't find a bit more sense in th' engineering
business than what _that_ comes to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, looking round with some anxiety at this announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
prospects, unthinkingly withdrew a small rattle he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was amusing baby
Moss with, whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>), being a baby that knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) own mind with
remarkable clearness, instantaneously expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) sentiments in a
piercing yell, and was not to be appeased even by the restoration of
the rattle, feeling apparently that the original wrong of having it
taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) remained in all its force. Mrs. Moss hurried away with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) into another room, and expressed to Mrs. Tulliver, who accompanied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), the conviction that the dear child had good reasons for crying;
implying that if it was supposed to be the rattle that baby clamored
for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was a misunderstood baby. The thoroughly justifiable yell
being quieted, Mrs. Moss looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) sister-in-law and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to see brother so put out about this water work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's your brother's way, Mrs. Moss; I'd never anything o' that sort
before I was married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, with a half-implied
reproach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) always spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband as <div class="bookquote">``your brother''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>to Mrs.
Moss in any case when his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) line of conduct was not matter of pure
admiration. Amiable Mrs. Tulliver, who was never angry in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) life,
had yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mild share of that spirit without which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could hardly
have been at once a Dodson and a woman. Being always on the defensive
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) own sisters, it was natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) should be keenly
conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) superiority, even as the weakest Dodson, over a
husband's sister, who, besides being poorly off, and inclined to <div class="bookquote">``hang
on''  (<font color='red'><b>husband sister</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) brother, had the good-natured submissiveness of a large,
easy-tempered, untidy, prolific woman, with affection enough in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
not only for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own husband and abundant children, but for any number
of collateral relations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope and pray he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) won't go to law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, <div class="bookquote">``for there's
never any knowing where that'll end. And the right doesn't allays win.
This Mr. Pivart's a rich man, by what I can make out, and the rich
mostly get things their own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) dress down, <div class="bookquote">``I've seen
what riches are in my own family; for my sisters have got husbands as
can afford to do pretty much what they like. But I think sometimes I
shall be drove off my head with the talk about this law and erigation;
and my sisters lay all the fault to me, for they don't know what it is
to marry a man like your brother; how should they? Sister Pullet has
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) own way from morning till night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I should like my husband if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
hadn't got any wits of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own, and I had to find head-piece for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
It's a deal easier to do what pleases one's husband, than to be
puzzling what else one should do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If people come to talk o' doing what pleases their husbands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Tulliver, with a faint imitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister Glegg, ``I'm sure
your brother might have waited a long while before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'d have found a
wife that `ud have let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) say in everything, as I do. It's
nothing but law and erigation now, from when we first get up in the
morning till we go to bed at night; and I never contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); I only
say, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Tulliver, do as you like; but whativer you do, don't
go to law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver, as we have seen, was not without influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
husband. No woman is; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) can always incline him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to do either what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
wishes, or the reverse; and on the composite impulses that were
threatening to hurry Mr. Tulliver into <div class="bookquote">``law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tulliver's
monotonous pleading had doubtless its share of force; it might even be
comparable to that proverbial feather which has the credit or
discredit of breaking the camel's back; though, on a strictly
impartial view, the blame ought rather to lie with the previous weight
of feathers which had already placed the back in such imminent peril
that an otherwise innocent feather could not settle on it without
mischief. Not that Mrs. Tulliver's feeble beseeching could have had
this feather's weight in virtue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) single personality; but
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) departed from entire assent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
the representative of the Dodson family; and it was a guiding
principle with Mr. Tulliver to let the Dodsons know that they were not
to domineer over _him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)_, or--more specifically--that a male Tulliver
was far more than equal to four female Dodsons, even though one of
them was Mrs. Glegg.

<p/>But not even a direct argument from that typical Dodson female herself
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) going to law could have heightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) disposition toward
it so much as the mere thought of Wakem, continually freshened by the
sight of the too able attorney on market-days. Wakem, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) certain
knowledge, was -LRB-metaphorically speaking-RRB- at the bottom of Pivart's
irrigation; Wakem had tried to make Dix stand out, and go to law about
the dam; it was unquestionably Wakem who had caused Mr. Tulliver to
lose the suit about the right of road and the bridge that made a
thoroughfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) land for every vagabond who preferred an
opportunity of damaging private property to walking like an honest man
along the highroad; all lawyers were more or less rascals, but Wakem's
rascality was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself
in opposition to that form of right embodied in Mr. Tulliver's
interests and opinions. And as an extra touch of bitterness, the
injured miller had recently, in borrowing the five hundred pounds,
been obliged to carry a little business to Wakem's office on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) own
account. A hook-nosed glib fellow! as cool as a cucumber,--always
looking so sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) game! And it was vexatious that Lawyer Gore was
not more like him (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>), but was a bald, round-featured man, with bland
manners and fat hands; a game-cock that you would be rash to bet upon
against Wakem. Gore was a sly fellow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) weakness did not lie on the
side of scrupulosity; but the largest amount of winking, however
significant, is not equivalent to seeing through a stone wall; and
confident as Mr. Tulliver was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) principle that water was water,
and in the direct inference that Pivart had not a leg to stand on in
this affair of irrigation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pivart</b></font>) had an uncomfortable suspicion that
Wakem had more law to show against this -LRB-rationally-RRB- irrefragable
inference than Gore could show for it. But then, if they went to law,
there was a chance for Mr. Tulliver to employ Counsellor Wylde on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
side, instead of having that admirable bully against him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>); and the
prospect of seeing a witness of Wakem's made to perspire and become
confounded, as Mr. Tulliver's witness had once been, was alluring to
the love of retributive justice.

<p/>Much rumination had Mr. Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
rides on the gray horse; much turning of the head from side to side,
as the scales dipped alternately; but the probable result was still
out of sight, only to be reached through much hot argument and
iteration in domestic and social life. That initial stage of the
dispute which consisted in the narration of the case and the
enforcement of Mr. Tulliver's views concerning it throughout the
entire circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) connections would necessarily take time; and at
the beginning of February, when Tom was going to school again, there
were scarcely any new items to be detected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's statement
of the case against Pivart, or any more specific indication of the
measures he (<font color='blue'><b>Pivart</b></font>) was bent on taking against that rash contravener of the
principle that water was water. Iteration, like friction, is likely to
generate heat instead of progress, and Mr. Tulliver's heat was
certainly more and more palpable. If there had been no new evidence on
any other point, there had been new evidence that Pivart was as <div class="bookquote">``thick
as mud''  (<font color='red'><b>Pivart/Mr. Pivart</b></font>)</div>with Wakem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, one evening near the end of the holidays, <div class="bookquote">``uncle
Glegg says Lawyer Wakem _is_ going to send his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) son to Mr. Stelling. It
isn't true, what they said about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) going to be sent to France. You
won't like me to go to school with Wakem's son, shall you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no matter for that, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``don't you learn
anything bad of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), that's all. The lad's a poor deformed creatur,
and takes after his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother in the face; I think there isn't much of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father in him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). It's a sign Wakem thinks high o' Mr. Sterling, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>), and Wakem knows meal from bran.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) heart was rather proud of the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) son
was to have the same advantages as Wakem's; but Tom was not at all
easy on the point. It would have been much clearer if the lawyer's son
had not been deformed, for then Tom would have had the prospect of
pitching into him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with all that freedom which is derived from a high
moral sanction.



<p/>Chapter III

<p/>The New Schoolfellow


<p/>It was a cold, wet January day on which Tom went back to school; a day
quite in keeping with this severe phase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) destiny. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not
carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket a parcel of sugar-candy and a small Dutch doll
for little Laura, there would have been no ray of expected pleasure to
enliven the general gloom. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) liked to think how Laura would put
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) lips and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tiny hands for the bits of sugarcandy; and to
give the greater keenness to these pleasures of imagination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took
out the parcel, made a small hole in the paper, and bit off a crystal
or two, which had so solacing an effect under the confined prospect
and damp odors of the gig-umbrella, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) repeated the process more
than once on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Tulliver, we're glad to see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stelling,
heartily. <div class="bookquote">``Take off your wrappings and come into the study till
dinner. You'll find a bright fire there, and a new companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) woollen
comforter and other wrappings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had seen Philip Wakem at St. Ogg's,
but had always turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) eyes away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) as quickly as possible.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) would have disliked having a deformed boy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) companion, even
if Philip had not been the son of a bad man. And Tom did not see how a
bad man's son could be very good. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own father was a good man, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would readily have fought any one who said the contrary. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was in
a state of mingled embarrassment and defiance as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) followed Mr.
Stelling to the study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a new companion for you to shake hands with, Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
that gentleman on entering the study,--<div class="bookquote">``Master Philip Wakem. I shall
leave you to make acquaintance by yourselves. You already know
something of each other, I imagine; for you are neighbors at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom looked confused and awkward, while Philip rose and glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
timidly. Tom did not like to go up and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
not prepared to say, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on so short a notice.

<p/>Mr. Stelling wisely turned away, and closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>); boys'
shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders.

<p/>Philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
thought, or rather felt, that Tom had an aversion to looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>);
every one, almost, disliked looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deformity was more
conspicuous when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked. So they remained without shaking hands or
even speaking, while Tom went to the fire and warmed himself, every
now and then casting furtive glances at Philip, who seemed to be
drawing absently first one object and then another on a piece of paper
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had before him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had seated himself again, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) drew, was
thinking what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could say to Tom, and trying to overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own
repugnance to making the first advances.

<p/>Tom began to look oftener and longer at Philip's face, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could
see it without noticing the hump, and it was really not a disagreeable
face,--very old-looking, Tom thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wondered how much older
Philip was than himself. An anatomist--even a mere physiognomist--
would have seen that the deformity of Philip's spine was not a
congenital hump, but the result of an accident in infancy; but you
do not expect from Tom any acquaintance with such distinctions;
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Philip was simply a humpback. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had a vague notion
that the deformity of Wakem's son had some relation to the lawyer's
rascality, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had so often heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father talk with hot
emphasis; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt, too, a half-admitted fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as probably
a spiteful fellow, who, not being able to fight you, had cunning
ways of doing you a mischief by the sly. There was a humpbacked
tailor in the neighborhood of Mr. Jacobs's academy, who was considered
a very unamiable character, and was much hooted after by public-spirited
boys solely on the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) unsatisfactory moral qualities; so
that Tom was not without a basis of fact to go upon. Still, no face
could be more unlike that ugly tailor's than this melancholy boy's
face,--the brown hair round it waved and curled at the ends like a
girl's; Tom thought that truly pitiable. This Wakem was a pale,
puny fellow, and it was quite clear he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would not be able to play at
anything worth speaking of; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) handled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pencil in an enviable
manner, and was apparently making one thing after another without
any trouble. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drawing? Tom was quite warm now, and wanted
something new to be going forward. It was certainly more agreeable
to have an ill-natured humpback as a companion than to stand looking
out of the study window at the rain, and kicking his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) foot against
the washboard in solitude; something would happen every day,--
<div class="bookquote">``a quarrel or something'' (<font color='red'><b>a companion</b></font>)</div>; and Tom thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should rather like to
show Philip that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had better not try his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spiteful tricks on _him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly walked across the hearth and looked over Philip's paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that's a donkey with panniers, and a spaniel, and partridges in
the corn!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exclaimed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tongue being completely loosed by
surprise and admiration. <div class="bookquote">``Oh my buttons! I wish I could draw like
that. I'm to learn drawing this half; I wonder if I shall learn to
make dogs and donkeys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you can do them without learning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip; <div class="bookquote">``I never learned
drawing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never learned?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in amazement. <div class="bookquote">``Why, when I make dogs and
horses, and those things, the heads and the legs won't come right;
though I can see how they ought to be very well. I can make houses,
and all sorts of chimneys,--chimneys going all down the wall,--and
windows in the roof, and all that. But I dare say I could do dogs and
horses if I was to try more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) added, reflecting that Philip might
falsely suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was going to <div class="bookquote">``knock under,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) were too
frank about the imperfection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) accomplishments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, <div class="bookquote">``it's very easy. You've only to look well at
things, and draw them over and over again. What you do wrong once, you
can alter the next time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But haven't you been taught _any_thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, beginning to have
a puzzled suspicion that Philip's crooked back might be the source of
remarkable faculties. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd been to school a long while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``I've been taught Latin and Greek and
mathematics, and writing and such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but I say, you don't like Latin, though, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom,
lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice confidentially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well; I don't care much about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but perhaps you haven't got into the _Propria quæ maribus_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Tom, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head sideways, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``that was the test;
it was easy talking till you came to _that_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip felt some bitter complacency in the promising stupidity of this
well-made, active-looking boy; but made polite by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own extreme
sensitiveness, as well as by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) desire to conciliate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
inclination to laugh, and said quietly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done with the grammar; I don't learn that any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you won't have the same lessons as I shall?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with a
sense of disappointment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I dare say I can help you. I shall be very glad to help you
if I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom did not say <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was quite absorbed in the thought
that Wakem's son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been
expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said presently, <div class="bookquote">``do you love your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, coloring deeply; <div class="bookquote">``don't you love yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--I only wanted to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, rather ashamed of himself,
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw Philip coloring and looking uncomfortable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) found much
difficulty in adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) attitude of mind toward the son of Lawyer
Wakem, and it had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) that if Philip disliked his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father,
that fact might go some way toward clearing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) perplexity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you learn drawing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, by way of changing the
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``My father wishes me to give all my time to other
things now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Latin and Euclid, and those things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, who had left off using his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pencil, and was resting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head on one hand, while Tom was learning forward on both elbows,
and looking with increasing admiration at the dog and the donkey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't mind that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with strong curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I like to know what everybody else knows. I can study what I like
by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think why anybody should learn Latin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``It's no
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's part of the education of a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``All
gentlemen learn the same things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! do you think Sir John Crake, the master of the harriers, knows
Latin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who had often thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should like to resemble Sir
John Crake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Crake</b></font>) learned it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crake</b></font>) was a boy, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``But I dare
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Crake</b></font>)'s forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, I can do that, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, not with any epigrammatic
intention, but with serious satisfaction at the idea that, as far as
Latin was concerned, there was no hindrance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resembling Sir John
Crake. ``Only you're obliged to remember it while you're at school,
else you've got to learn ever so many lines of ``Speaker.'' Mr.
Stelling's very particular--did you know? He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>)'ll have you up ten times
if you say `nam' for ``jam,'--h<div class="bookquote">'' won't let you go a letter wrong, _I_
can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, unable to choke a laugh; <div class="bookquote">``I can
remember things easily. And there are some lessons I'm very fond of.
I'm very fond of Greek history, and everything about the Greeks. I
should like to have been a Greek and fought the Persians, and then
have come home and have written tragedies, or else have been listened
to by everybody for my wisdom, like Socrates, and have died a grand
death.''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Philip, you perceive, was not without a wish to impress the
well-made barbarian with a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mental superiority.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, were the Greeks great fighters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who saw a vista in
this direction. <div class="bookquote">``Is there anything like David and Goliath and Samson
in the Greek history? Those are the only bits I like in the history of
the Jews.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there are very fine stories of that sort about the Greeks,--about
the heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts, as Samson did.
And in the Odyssey--that's a beautiful poem--there's a more wonderful
giant than Goliath,--Polypheme, who had only one eye in the middle of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) forehead; and Ulysses, a little fellow, but very wise and cunning,
got a red-hot pine-tree and stuck it into this one eye, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>)
roar like a thousand bulls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what fun!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, jumping away from the table, and stamping
first with one leg and then the other. <div class="bookquote">``I say, can you tell me all
about those stories? Because I sha'n't learn Greek, you know. Shall
I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stamping with a sudden alarm, lest the
contrary might be possible. <div class="bookquote">``Does every gentleman learn Greek? Will
Mr. Stelling make me begin with it, do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I should think not, very likely not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``But you may
read those stories without knowing Greek. I've got them in English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but I don't like reading; I'd sooner have you tell them me. But
only the fighting ones, you know. My sister Maggie is always wanting
to tell me stories, but they're stupid things. Girls' stories always
are. Can you tell a good many fighting stories?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip; <div class="bookquote">``lots of them, besides the Greek stories. I can
tell you about Richard Cœur-de-Lion and Saladin, and about William
Wallace and Robert Bruce and James Douglas,--I know no end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're older than I am, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how old are _you?_ I'm fifteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm only going in fourteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``But I thrashed all the
fellows at Jacob's--that's where I was before I came here. And I beat
'em all at bandy and climbing. And I wish Mr. Stelling would let us go
fishing. _I_ could show you how to fish. You _could_ fish, couldn't
you? It's only standing, and sitting still, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turn, wished to make the balance dip in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) favor. This
hunchback must not suppose that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) acquaintance with fighting stories
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on a par with an actual fighting hero, like Tom Tulliver.
Philip winced under this allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) unfitness for active sports,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) answered almost peevishly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear fishing. I think people look like fools sitting watching
a line hour after hour, or else throwing and throwing, and catching
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but you wouldn't say they looked like fools when they landed a
big pike, I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who had never caught anything
that was <div class="bookquote">``big''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, but whose imagination was on the stretch
with indignant zeal for the honor of sport. Wakem's son, it was plain,
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) disagreeable points, and must be kept in due check. Happily
for the harmony of this first interview, they were now called to
dinner, and Philip was not allowed to develop farther his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) unsound
views on the subject of fishing. But Tom said to himself, that was
just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should have expected from a hunchback.



<p/>Chapter IV

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Young Idea''


 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>The alterations of feeling in that first dialogue between Tom and
Philip continued to make their intercourse even after many weeks of
schoolboy intimacy. Tom never quite lost the feeling that Philip,
being the son of a <div class="bookquote">``rascal,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) natural enemy; never thoroughly
overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) repulsion to Philip's deformity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was a boy who adhered
tenaciously to impressions once received; as with all minds in which
mere perception predominates over thought and emotion, the external
remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rigidly what it was in the first instance. But then it
was impossible not to like Philip's company when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was in a good
humor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could help one so well in one's Latin exercises, which Tom
regarded as a kind of puzzle that could only be found out by a lucky
chance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could tell such wonderful fighting stories about Hal of
the Wynd, for example, and other heroes who were especial favorites
with Tom, because they laid about them with heavy strokes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
small opinion of Saladin, whose cimeter could cut a cushion in two in
an instant; who wanted to cut cushions? That was a stupid story, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't care to hear it again. But when Robert Bruce, on the black
pony, rose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>) stirrups, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>) good battle-axe, cracked
at once the helmet and the skull of the too hasty knight at
Bannockburn, then Tom felt all the exaltation of sympathy, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had had a cocoanut at hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have cracked it at once with the
poker. Philip in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) happier moods indulged Tom to the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
bent, heightening the crash and bang and fury of every fight with all
the artillery of epithets and similes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) command. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not
always in a good humor or happy mood. The slight spurt of peevish
susceptibility which had escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in their first interview was a
symptom of a perpetually recurring mental ailment, half of it nervous
irritability, half of it the heart-bitterness produced by the sense of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deformity. In these fits of susceptibility every glance seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to be charged either with offensive pity or with ill-repressed
disgust; at the very least it was an indifferent glance, and Philip
felt indifference as a child of the south feels the chill air of a
northern spring. Poor Tom's blundering patronage when they were out of
doors together would sometimes make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turn upon the well-meaning lad
quite savagely; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, usually sad and quiet, would flash with
anything but playful lightning. No wonder Tom retained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suspicions
of the humpback.

<p/>But Philip's self-taught skill in drawing was another link between
them; for Tom found, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) disgust, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new drawing-master gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) no dogs and donkeys to draw, but brooks and rustic bridges and
ruins, all with a general softness of black-lead surface, indicating
that nature, if anything, was rather satiny; and as Tom's feeling for
the picturesque in landscape was at present quite latent, it is not
surprising that Mr. Goodrich's productions seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Goodrich</b></font>) an
uninteresting form of art. Mr. Tulliver, having a vague intention that
Tom should be put to some business which included the drawing out of
plans and maps, had complained to Mr. Riley, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) at
Mudport, that Tom seemed to be learning nothing of that sort;
whereupon that obliging adviser had suggested that Tom should have
drawing-lessons. Mr. Tulliver must not mind paying extra for drawing;
let Tom be made a good draughtsman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would be able to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
pencil to any purpose. So it was ordered that Tom should have
drawing-lessons; and whom should Mr. Stelling have selected as a
master if not Mr. Goodrich, who was considered quite at the head of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) profession within a circuit of twelve miles round King's Lorton?
By which means Tom learned to make an extremely fine point to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
pencil, and to represent landscape with a <div class="bookquote">``broad generality,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>which,
doubtless from a narrow tendency in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind to details, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought
extremely dull.

<p/>All this, you remember, happened in those dark ages when there were no
schools of design; before schoolmasters were invariably men of
scrupulous integrity, and before the clergy were all men of enlarged
minds and varied culture. In those less favored days, it is no fable
that there were other clergymen besides Mr. Stelling who had narrow
intellects and large wants, and whose income, by a logical confusion
to which Fortune, being a female as well as blindfold, is peculiarly
liable, was proportioned not to their wants but to their intellect,
with which income has clearly no inherent relation. The problem these
gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their
wants and their income; and since wants are not easily starved to
death, the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income. There
was but one way of doing this; any of those low callings in which men
are obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to
clergymen; was it their fault if their only resource was to turn out
very poor work at a high price? Besides, how should Mr. Stelling be
expected to know that education was a delicate and difficult business,
any more than an animal endowed with a power of boring a hole through
a rock should be expected to have wide views of excavation? Mr.
Stelling's faculties had been early trained to boring in a straight
line, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) had no faculty to spare. But among Tom's contemporaries,
whose fathers cast their sons on clerical instruction to find them
ignorant after many days, there were many far less lucky than Tom
Tulliver. Education was almost entirely a matter of luck--usually of
ill-luck--in those distant days. The state of mind in which you take a
billiard-cue or a dice-box in your hand is one of sober certainty
compared with that of old-fashioned fathers, like Mr. Tulliver, when
they selected a school or a tutor for their sons. Excellent men, who
had been forced all their lives to spell on an impromptu-phonetic
system, and having carried on a successful business in spite of this
disadvantage, had acquired money enough to give their sons a better
start in life than they had had themselves, must necessarily take
their chance as to the conscience and the competence of the
schoolmaster whose circular fell in their way, and appeared to promise
so much more than they would ever have thought of asking for,
including the return of linen, fork, and spoon. It was happy for them
if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not brought up his (<font color='blue'><b>draper</b></font>)
son to the Church, and if that young gentleman, at the age of
four-and-twenty, had not closed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) college dissipations by an
imprudent marriage; otherwise, these innocent fathers, desirous of
doing the best for their offspring, could only escape the draper's son
by happening to be on the foundation of a grammar-school as yet
unvisited by commissioners, where two or three boys could have, all to
themselves, the advantages of a large and lofty building, together
with a head-master, toothless, dim-eyed and deaf, whose erudite
indistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate of
three hundred pounds a-head,--a ripe scholar, doubtless, when first
appointed; but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less
esteemed in the market.

<p/>Tom Tulliver, then, compared with many other British youths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
time who have since had to scramble through life with some fragments
of more or less relevant knowledge, and a great deal of strictly
relevant ignorance, was not so very unlucky. Mr. Stelling was a
broad-chested, healthy man, with the bearing of a gentleman, a
conviction that a growing boy required a sufficiency of beef, and a
certain hearty kindness in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) like to see Tom looking
well and enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dinner; not a man of refined conscience, or with
any deep sense of the infinite issues belonging to every-day duties,
not quite competent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) high offices; but incompetent gentlemen
must live, and without private fortune it is difficult to see how they
could all live genteelly if they had nothing to do with education or
government. Besides, it was the fault of Tom's mental constitution
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) faculties could not be nourished on the sort of knowledge Mr.
Stelling had to communicate. A boy born with a deficient power of
apprehending signs and abstractions must suffer the penalty of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
congenital deficiency, just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been born with one leg
shorter than the other. A method of education sanctioned by the long
practice of our venerable ancestors was not to give way before the
exceptional dulness of a boy who was merely living at the time then
present. And Mr. Stelling was convinced that a boy so stupid at signs
and abstractions must be stupid at everything else, even if that
reverend gentleman could have taught him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) everything else. It was the
practice of our venerable ancestors to apply that ingenious instrument
the thumb-screw, and to tighten and tighten it in order to elicit
non-existent facts; they had a fixed opinion to begin with, that the
facts were existent, and what had they to do but to tighten the
thumb-screw? In like manner, Mr. Stelling had a fixed opinion that all
boys with any capacity could learn what it was the only regular thing
to teach; if they were slow, the thumb-screw must be tightened,--the
exercises must be insisted on with increased severity, and a page of
Virgil be awarded as a penalty, to encourage and stimulate a too
languid inclination to Latin verse.

<p/>The thumb-screw was a little relaxed, however, during this second
half-year. Philip was so advanced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) studies, and so apt, that Mr.
Stelling could obtain credit by his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) facility, which required little
help, much more easily than by the troublesome process of overcoming
Tom's dulness. Gentlemen with broad chests and ambitious intentions do
sometimes disappoint their friends by failing to carry the world
before them. Perhaps it is that high achievements demand some other
unusual qualification besides an unusual desire for high prizes;
perhaps it is that these stalwart gentlemen are rather indolent, their
_divinæ particulum auræ_ being obstructed from soaring by a too hearty
appetite. Some reason or other there was why Mr. Stelling deferred the
execution of many spirited projects,--why he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) did not begin the editing
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) Greek play, or any other work of scholarship, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) leisure
hours, but, after turning the key of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) private study with much
resolution, sat down to one of Theodore Hook's novels. Tom was
gradually allowed to shuffle through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lessons with less rigor, and
having Philip to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was able to make some show of having
applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind in a confused and blundering way, without being
cross-examined into a betrayal that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind had been entirely neutral
in the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought school much more bearable under this
modification of circumstances; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went on contentedly enough,
picking up a promiscuous education chiefly from things that were not
intended as education at all. What was understood to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) education
was simply the practice of reading, writing, and spelling, carried on
by an elaborate appliance of unintelligible ideas, and by much failure
in the effort to learn by rote.

<p/>Nevertheless, there was a visible improvement in Tom under this
training; perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not a boy in the abstract, existing
solely to illustrate the evils of a mistaken education, but a boy made
of flesh and blood, with dispositions not entirely at the mercy of
circumstances.

<p/>There was a great improvement in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bearing, for example; and some
credit on this score was due to Mr. Poulter, the village schoolmaster,
who, being an old Peninsular soldier, was employed to drill Tom,--a
source of high mutual pleasure. Mr. Poulter, who was understood by the
company at the Black Swan to have once struck terror into the hearts
of the French, was no longer personally formidable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) had rather a
shrunken appearance, and was tremulous in the mornings, not from age,
but from the extreme perversity of the King's Lorton boys, which
nothing but gin could enable him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to sustain with any firmness. Still,
he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) carried himself with martial erectness, had his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) clothes
scrupulously brushed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) trousers tightly strapped; and on the
Wednesday and Saturday afternoons, when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came to Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was always
inspired with gin and old memories, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) an exceptionally
spirited air, as of a superannuated charger who hears the drum. The
drilling-lessons were always protracted by episodes of warlike
narrative, much more interesting to Tom than Philip's stories out of
the Iliad; for there were no cannon in the Iliad, and besides, Tom had
felt some disgust on learning that Hector and Achilles might possibly
never have existed. But the Duke of Wellington was really alive, and
Bony had not been long dead; therefore Mr. Poulter's reminiscences of
the Peninsular War were removed from all suspicion of being mythical.
Mr. Poulter, it appeared, had been a conspicuous figure at Talavera,
and had contributed not a little to the peculiar terror with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>)
regiment of infantry was regarded by the enemy. On afternoons when his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>)
memory was more stimulated than usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) remembered that the Duke of
Wellington had -LRB-in strict privacy, lest jealousies should be awakened-RRB-
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) esteem for that fine fellow Poulter. The very surgeon
who attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) in the hospital after he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) had received his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>)
gunshot-wound had been profoundly impressed with the superiority of
Mr. Poulter's flesh,--no other flesh would have healed in anything
like the same time. On less personal matters connected with the
important warfare in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) had been engaged, Mr. Poulter was more
reticent, only taking care not to give the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) authority to
any loose notions concerning military history. Any one who pretended
to a knowledge of what occurred at the siege of Badajos was especially
an object of silent pity to Mr. Poulter; he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) wished that prating person
had been run down, and had the breath trampled out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) at the first
go-off, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) himself had,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) might talk about the siege of Badajos
then! Tom did not escape irritating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drilling-master occasionally,
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) curiosity concerning other military matters than Mr. Poulter's
personal experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And General Wolfe, Mr. Poulter,--wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) a wonderful fighter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Tom, who held the notion that all the martial heroes commemorated on
the public-house signs were engaged in the war with Bony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poulter, contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing o' the sort!
Heads up!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) added, in a tone of stern command, which delighted Tom,
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were a regiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>Mr. Poulter would continue, on coming to a pause in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>)
discipline; <div class="bookquote">``they'd better not talk to me about General Wolfe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) did
nothing but die of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) wound; that's a poor haction, I consider. Any
other man `ud have died o' the wounds I've had. One of my sword-cuts
`ud ha' killed a fellow like General Wolfe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Poulter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom would say, at any allusion to the sword, <div class="bookquote">``I wish
you'd bring your sword and do the sword-exercise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>For a long while Mr. Poulter only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) head in a significant
manner at this request, and smiled patronizingly, as Jupiter may have
done when Semele urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) too ambitious request. But one afternoon,
when a sudden shower of heavy rain had detained Mr. Poulter twenty
minutes longer than usual at the Black Swan, the sword was
brought,--just for Tom to look at.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is the real sword you fought with in all the battles, Mr.
Poulter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, handling the hilt. <div class="bookquote">``Has it ever cut a Frenchman's
head off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Head off? Ah! and would, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>)'d had three heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you had a gun and bayonet besides?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">''_I_ should like
the gun and bayonet best, because you could shoot 'em first and spear
'em after. Bang! Ps-s-s-s!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom gave the requisite pantomime to
indicate the double enjoyment of pulling the trigger and thrusting the
spear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but the sword's the thing when you come to close fighting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Poulter, involuntarily falling in with Tom's enthusiasm, and
drawing the sword so suddenly that Tom leaped back with much agility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but, Mr. Poulter, if you're going to do the exercise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom,
a little conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ground as became an
Englishman, <div class="bookquote">``let me go and call Philip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>)'ll like to see you, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! the humpbacked lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poulter, contemptuously; <div class="bookquote">``what's
the use of _his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)_ looking on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) knows a great deal about fighting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``and how
they used to fight with bows and arrows, and battle-axes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) come, then. I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) something different from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bows
and arrows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poulter, coughing and drawing himself up, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) gave a little preliminary play to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) wrist.

<p/>Tom ran in to Philip, who was enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) afternoon's holiday at the
piano, in the drawing-room, picking out tunes for himself and singing
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was supremely happy, perched like an amorphous bundle on the
high stool, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head thrown back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes fixed on the opposite
cornice, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips wide open, sending forth, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might,
impromptu syllables to a tune of Arne's which had hit his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, bursting in; <div class="bookquote">``don't stay roaring `la la'
there; come and see old Poulter do his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) sword-exercise in the
carriage-house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>The jar of this interruption, the discord of Tom's tones coming across
the notes to which Philip was vibrating in soul and body, would have
been enough to unhinge his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) temper, even if there had been no question
of Poulter the drilling-master; and Tom, in the hurry of seizing
something to say to prevent Mr. Poulter from thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) was afraid of
the sword when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) sprang away from it, had alighted on this
proposition to fetch Philip, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knew well enough that Philip
hated to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) drilling-lessons. Tom would never have
done so inconsiderate a thing except under the severe stress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
personal pride.

<p/>Philip shuddered visibly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) paused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) music. Then turning
red, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, with violent passion,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get away, you lumbering idiot! Don't come bellowing at me; you're not
fit to speak to anything but a cart-horse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not the first time Philip had been made angry by him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), but Tom
had never before been assailed with verbal missiles that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) understood
so well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm fit to speak to something better than you, you poor-spirited
imp!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, lighting up immediately at Philip's fire. <div class="bookquote">``You know I
won't hit you, because you're no better than a girl. But I'm an honest
man's son, and _your_ father's a rogue; everybody says so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom flung out of the room, and slammed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), made
strangely heedless by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) anger; for to slam doors within the hearing
of Mrs. Stelling, who was probably not far off, was an offence only to
be wiped out by twenty lines of Virgil. In fact, that lady did
presently descend from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) room, in double wonder at the noise and the
subsequent cessation of Philip's music. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sitting in a
heap on the hassock, and crying bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Wakem? what was that noise about? Who slammed the
door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip looked up, and hastily dried his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It was Tulliver who
came in--to ask me to go out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you in trouble about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Stelling.

<p/>Philip was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) favorite of the two pupils; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was less obliging
than Tom, who was made useful in many ways. Still, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father paid
more than Mr. Tulliver did, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) meant him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) behaved
exceedingly well to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). Philip, however, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) advances toward a
good understanding very much as a caressed mollusk meets an invitation
to show himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shell. Mrs. Stelling was not a loving,
tender-hearted woman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was a woman whose skirt sat well, who
adjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) waist and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) curls with a preoccupied air when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) inquired after your welfare. These things, doubtless, represent a
great social power, but it is not the power of love; and no other
power could win Philip from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) personal reserve.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) question, <div class="bookquote">``My toothache came on, and made me
hysterical again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>This had been the fact once, and Philip was glad of the recollection;
it was like an inspiration to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to excuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) crying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
to accept eau-de-Cologne and to refuse creosote in consequence; but
that was easy.

<p/>Meanwhile Tom, who had for the first time sent a poisoned arrow into
Philip's heart, had returned to the carriage-house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) found Mr.
Poulter, with a fixed and earnest eye, wasting the perfections of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
sword-exercise on probably observant but inappreciative rats. But Mr.
Poulter was a host in himself; that is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) admired himself more
than a whole army of spectators could have admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) took no
notice of Tom's return, being too entirely absorbed in the cut and
thrust,--the solemn one, two, three, four; and Tom, not without a
slight feeling of alarm at Mr. Poulter's fixed eye and hungry-looking
sword, which seemed impatient for something else to cut besides the
air, admired the performance from as great a distance as possible. It
was not until Mr. Poulter paused and wiped the perspiration from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>)
forehead, that Tom felt the full charm of the sword-exercise, and
wished it to be repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Poulter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, when the sword was being finally sheathed, <div class="bookquote">``I
wish you'd lend me your sword a little while to keep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No no, young gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poulter, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) head
decidedly; <div class="bookquote">``you might do yourself some mischief with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm sure I wouldn't; I'm sure I'd take care and not hurt myself.
I shouldn't take it out of the sheath much, but I could ground arms
with it, and all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it won't do, I tell you; it won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poulter,
preparing to depart. <div class="bookquote">``What `ud Mr. Stelling say to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say, do, Mr. Poulter! I'd give you my five-shilling piece if
you'd let me keep the sword a week. Look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, reaching out
the attractively large round of silver. The young dog calculated the
effect as well as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) had been a philosopher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poulter, with still deeper gravity, <div class="bookquote">``you must keep it
out of sight, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I'll keep it under the bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``or else at
the bottom of my large box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And let me see, now, whether you can draw it out of the sheath
without hurting yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>That process having been gone through more
than once, Mr. Poulter felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) had acted with scrupulous
conscientiousness, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, now, Master Tulliver, if I take
the crown-piece, it is to make sure as you'll do no mischief with the
sword.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, indeed, Mr. Poulter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, delightedly handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the
crown-piece, and grasping the sword, which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, might have
been lighter with advantage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if Mr. Stelling catches you carrying it in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Poulter/Poulter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Poulter,
pocketing the crown-piece provisionally while he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) raised this new
doubt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) always keeps in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poulter</b></font>) upstairs study on Saturday afternoon,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who disliked anything sneaking, but was not disinclined to a
little stratagem in a worthy cause. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) carried off the sword in
triumph mixed with dread--dread that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might encounter Mr. or Mrs.
Stelling--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bedroom, where, after some consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hid it
in the closet behind some hanging clothes. That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fell asleep
in the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would astonish Maggie with it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
came,--tie it round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waist with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) red comforter, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
believe that the sword was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going to be a
soldier. There was nobody but Maggie who would be silly enough to
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), or whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dared allow to know he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a sword; and Maggie
was really coming next week to see Tom, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went to a
boarding-school with Lucy.

<p/>If you think a lad of thirteen would have been so childish, you must
be an exceptionally wise man, who, although you are devoted to a civil
calling, requiring you to look bland rather than formidable, yet
never, since you had a beard, threw yourself into a martial attitude,
and frowned before the looking-glass. It is doubtful whether our
soldiers would be maintained if there were not pacific people at home
who like to fancy themselves soldiers. War, like other dramatic
spectacles, might possibly cease for want of a <div class="bookquote">``public.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter V

<p/>Maggie's Second Visit


<p/>This last breach between the two lads was not readily mended, and for
some time they spoke to each other no more than was necessary. Their
natural antipathy of temperament made resentment an easy passage to
hatred, and in Philip the transition seemed to have begun; there was
no malignity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) disposition, but there was a susceptibility that
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) peculiarly liable to a strong sense of repulsion. The ox--we
may venture to assert it on the authority of a great classic--is not
given to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) teeth as an instrument of attack, and Tom was an
excellent bovine lad, who ran at questionable objects in a truly
ingenious bovine manner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had blundered on Philip's tenderest
point, and had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as much acute pain as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had studied the
means with the nicest precision and the most envenomed spite. Tom saw
no reason why they should not make up this quarrel as they had done
many others, by behaving as if nothing had happened; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
never before said to Philip that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father was a rogue, this idea had
so habitually made part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feeling as to the relation between
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dubious schoolfellow, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could neither like nor
dislike, that the mere utterance did not make such an epoch to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as
it did to Philip. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had a right to say so when Philip hectored
over _him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)_, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) names. But perceiving that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) first
advances toward amity were not met, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) least
favorable disposition toward Philip, and resolved never to appeal to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) either about drawing or exercise again. They were only so far
civil to each other as was necessary to prevent their state of feud
from being observed by Mr. Stelling, who would have <div class="bookquote">``put down''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>such
nonsense with great vigor.

<p/>When Maggie came, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could not help looking with growing
interest at the new schoolfellow, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was the son of that
wicked Lawyer Wakem, who made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father so angry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had arrived in
the middle of school-hours, and had sat by while Philip went through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lessons with Mr. Stelling. Tom, some weeks ago, had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) word
that Philip knew no end of stories,--not stupid stories like hers; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was convinced now from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own observation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must be very
clever; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would think _her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ rather clever too, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
came to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Maggie, moreover, had rather a tenderness for
deformed things; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) preferred the wry-necked lambs, because it seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldn't
mind so much about being petted; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was especially fond of
petting objects that would think it very delightful to be petted by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loved Tom very dearly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) often wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) _cared_
more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Philip Wakem seems a nice boy, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, when they went
out of the study together into the garden, to pass the interval before
dinner. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, you know; and I've read of
very bad men who had good sons, as well as good parents who had bad
children. And if Philip is good, I think we ought to be the more sorry
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) because his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father is not a good man. _You_ like him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), don't
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'s a queer fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, curtly, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'s as sulky as can
be with me, because I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father was a rogue. And I'd a right
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so, for it was true; and _he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)_ began it, with calling me
names. But you stop here by yourself a bit, Maggie, will you? I've got
something I want to do upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't I go too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, who in this first day of meeting again
loved Tom's shadow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's something I'll tell you about by-and-by, not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom,
skipping away.

<p/>In the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study, preparing
the morrow's lesson's that they might have a holiday in the evening in
honor of Maggie's arrival. Tom was hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Latin grammar,
moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient Catholic
repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tale of paternosters; and Philip, at the other end of
the room, was busy with two volumes, with a look of contented
diligence that excited Maggie's curiosity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not look at all as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) were learning a lesson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat on a low stool at nearly a right
angle with the two boys, watching first one and then the other; and
Philip, looking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) book once toward the fire-place, caught the
pair of questioning dark eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought this sister
of Tulliver's seemed a nice little thing, quite unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
wished _he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)_ had a little sister. What was it, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wondered, that made
Maggie's dark eyes remind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of the stories about princesses being
turned into animals? I think it was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes were full of
unsatisfied intelligence, and unsatisfied beseeching affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Magsie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom at last, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) books and putting them
away with the energy and decision of a perfect master in the art of
leaving off, <div class="bookquote">``I've done my lessons now. Come upstairs with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, when they were outside the door, a slight
suspicion crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) remembered Tom's preliminary visit
upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't a trick you're going to play me, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) most coaxing tone; <div class="bookquote">``It's something
you'll like _ever so_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) neck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put hers round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waist, and
twined together in this way, they went upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Magsie, you must not tell anybody, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``else
I shall get fifty lines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it alive?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, whose imagination had settled for the
moment on the idea that Tom kept a ferret clandestinely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I sha'n't tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now you go into that corner and
hide your face, while I reach it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) locked the
bedroom door behind them. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you when to turn round. You
mustn't squeal out, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but if you frighten me, I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, beginning to look
rather serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't be frightened, you silly thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Go and hide
your face, and mind you don't peep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I sha'n't peep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, disdainfully; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) buried
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face in the pillow like a person of strict honor.

<p/>But Tom looked round warily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked to the closet; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
stepped into the narrow space, and almost closed the door. Maggie kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face buried without the aid of principle, for in that
dream-suggestive attitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had soon forgotten where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thoughts were busy with the poor deformed boy, who was so clever,
when Tom called out, <div class="bookquote">``Now then, Magsie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects
would have enabled Tom to present so striking a figure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did to
Maggie when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked up. Dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a
face which had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow,
together with a pair of amiable blue-gray eyes and round pink cheeks
that refused to look formidable, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) frown as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would before the
looking-glass -LRB-Philip had once told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of a man who had a horseshoe
frown, and Tom had tried with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) frowning might to make a
horseshoe on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forehead-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had had recourse to that unfailing
source of the terrible, burnt cork, and had made himself a pair of
black eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nose, and
were matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had wound a red handkerchief round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cloth cap to give it the air of
a turban, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) red comforter across his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breast as a scarf,--an
amount of red which, with the tremendous frown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brow, and the
decision with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grasped the sword, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held it with its point
resting on the ground, would suffice to convey an approximate idea of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fierce and bloodthirsty disposition.

<p/>Maggie looked bewildered for a moment, and Tom enjoyed that moment
keenly; but in the next she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) laughed, clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands together, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, you've made yourself like Bluebeard at the show.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was clear she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not been struck with the presence of the
sword,--it was not unsheathed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) frivolous mind required a more
direct appeal to its sense of the terrible, and Tom prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
master-stroke. Frowning with a double amount of intention, if not of
corrugation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) -LRB-carefully-RRB- drew the sword from its sheath, and
pointed it at Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, please don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Maggie, in a tone of suppressed
dread, shrinking away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) into the opposite corner. <div class="bookquote">``I _shall_
scream--I'm sure I shall! Oh, don't I wish I'd never come upstairs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>The corners of Tom's mouth showed an inclination to a smile of
complacency that was immediately checked as inconsistent with the
severity of a great warrior. Slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) let down the scabbard on the
floor, lest it should make too much noise, and then said sternly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the Duke of Wellington! March!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>stamping forward with the right
leg a little bent, and the sword still pointing toward Maggie, who,
trembling, and with tear-filled eyes, got upon the bed, as the only
means of widening the space between them.

<p/>Tom, happy in this spectator of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) military performances, even though
the spectator was only Maggie, proceeded, with the utmost exertion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) force, to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would
necessarily be expected of the Duke of Wellington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, I _will not_ bear it, I _will_ scream,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, at the
first movement of the sword. <div class="bookquote">``You'll hurt yourself; you'll cut your
head off!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One--two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, resolutely, though at <div class="bookquote">``two''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wrist trembled a
little. <div class="bookquote">``Three''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>came more slowly, and with it the sword swung
downward, and Maggie gave a loud shriek. The sword had fallen, with
its edge on Tom's foot, and in a moment after he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had fallen too.
Maggie leaped from the bed, still shrieking, and immediately there was
a rush of footsteps toward the room. Mr. Stelling, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) upstairs
study, was the first to enter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) found both the children on the
floor. Tom had fainted, and Maggie was shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by the collar of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) jacket, screaming, with wild eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was dead, poor
child! and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as if that would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back to life.
In another minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was sobbing with joy because Tom opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't sorrow yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) foot; it seemed as
if all happiness lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) being alive.



<p/>Chapter VI

<p/>A Love-Scene


<p/>Poor Tom bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) severe pain heroically, and was resolute in not
<div class="bookquote">``telling''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>of Mr. Poulter more than was unavoidable; the five-shilling
piece remained a secret even to Maggie. But there was a terrible dread
weighing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind, so terrible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dared not even ask the
question which might bring the fatal <div class="bookquote">``yes'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dared not ask the
surgeon or Mr. Stelling, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I be lame, Sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) mastered himself
so as not to cry out at the pain; but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) foot had been dressed,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) was left alone with Maggie seated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) bedside, the children
sobbed together, with their heads laid on the same pillow. Tom was
thinking of himself walking about on crutches, like the wheelwright's
son; and Maggie, who did not guess what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind, sobbed for
company. It had not occurred to the surgeon or to Mr. Stelling to
anticipate this dread in Tom's mind, and to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by hopeful
words. But Philip watched the surgeon out of the house, and waylaid
Mr. Stelling to ask the very question that Tom had not dared to ask
for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir,--but does Mr. Askern say Tulliver will be
lame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stelling, <div class="bookquote">``not permanently; only for a
little while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) tell Tulliver so, sir, do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; nothing was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then may I go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure; now you mention it, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) may be troubling
about that. Go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) bedroom, but be very quiet at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been Philip's first thought when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) heard of the
accident,--<div class="bookquote">``Will Tulliver be lame? It will be very hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
is'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and Tom's hitherto unforgiven offences were washed out by that
pity. Philip felt that they were no longer in a state of repulsion,
but were being drawn into a common current of suffering and sad
privation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) imagination did not dwell on the outward calamity and
its future effect on Tom's life, but it made vividly present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
the probable state of Tom's feeling. Philip had only lived fourteen
years, but those years had, most of them, been steeped in the sense of
a lot irremediably hard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Askern says you'll soon be all right again, Tulliver, did you
know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said rather timidly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stepped gently up to Tom's bed.
<div class="bookquote">``I've just been to ask Mr. Stelling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) says you'll walk as well
as ever again by-and-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes
with a sudden joy; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gave a long sigh, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) blue-gray
eyes straight on Philip's face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not done for a fortnight or
more. As for Maggie, this intimation of a possibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not
thought of before affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as a new trouble; the bare idea of
Tom's being always lame overpowered the assurance that such a
misfortune was not likely to befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and
cried afresh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a little silly, Magsie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, tenderly, feeling very
brave now. <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon get well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by, Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) small, delicate
hand, which Tom clasped immediately with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) more substantial fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``ask Mr. Stelling to let you come and sit with me
sometimes, till I get up again, Wakem; and tell me about Robert Bruce,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>After that, Philip spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) time out of school-hours with Tom and
Maggie. Tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
insisted strongly on the fact that those great fighters who did so
many wonderful things and came off unhurt, wore excellent armor from
head to foot, which made fighting easy work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) considered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should
not have hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) foot if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had had an iron shoe on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) listened with
great interest to a new story of Philip's about a man who had a very
bad wound in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) foot, and cried out so dreadfully with the pain that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friends could bear with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) no longer, but put him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ashore on a
desert island, with nothing but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill
animals with for food.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't roar out a bit, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom said, <div class="bookquote">``and I dare say my foot
was as bad as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>). It's cowardly to roar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>But Maggie would have it that when anything hurt you very much, it was
quite permissible to cry out, and it was cruel of people not to bear
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted to know if Philoctetes had a sister, and why _she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_
didn't go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on the desert island and take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>One day, soon after Philip had told this story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and Maggie were in
the study alone together while Tom's foot was being dressed. Philip
was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) books, and Maggie, after sauntering idly round the room,
not caring to do anything in particular, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would soon go to
Tom again, went and leaned on the table near Philip to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was
doing, for they were quite old friends now, and perfectly at home with
each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you reading about in Greek?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's poetry, I can
see that, because the lines are so short.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's about Philoctetes, the lame man I was telling you of yesterday,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) answered, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
were not at all sorry to be interrupted. Maggie, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) absent way,
continued to lean forward, resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms and moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feet
about, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had quite forgotten Philip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, after a minute or two, still leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
elbow and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you had had a brother like me, do you
think you should have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as well as Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie started a little on being roused from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reverie, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Philip repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answered immediately. <div class="bookquote">``No, not better; because
I don't think I _could_ love you better than Tom. But I should be so
sorry,--_so sorry_ for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip colored; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had meant to imply, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) love him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as well in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) deformity, and yet when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) alluded to it so plainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
winced under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pity. Maggie, young as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mistake.
Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had instinctively behaved as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were quite
unconscious of Philip's deformity; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own keen sensitiveness and
experience under family criticism sufficed to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) this as well
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been directed by the most finished breeding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are so very clever, Philip, and you can play and sing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
added quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you _were_ my brother. I'm very fond of you.
And you would stay at home with me when Tom went out, and you would
teach me everything; wouldn't you,--Greek and everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll go away soon, and go to school, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, <div class="bookquote">``and
then you'll forget all about me, and not care for me any more. And
then I shall see you when you're grown up, and you'll hardly take any
notice of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I sha'n't forget you, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
head very seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I never forget anything, and I think about
everybody when I'm away from them. I think about poor Yap; he (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>)'s got a
lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) throat, and Luke says he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'ll die. Only don't you tell Tom.
because it will vex him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so. You never saw Yap; he (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>)'s a queer little
dog,--nobody cares about him (<font color='blue'><b>Yap</b></font>) but Tom and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you care as much about me as you do about Yap, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Philip, smiling rather sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very fond of _you_, Maggie; I shall never forget _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Philip, <div class="bookquote">``and when I'm very unhappy, I shall always think of you, and
wish I had a sister with dark eyes, just like yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you like my eyes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, well pleased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never
heard any one but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes as if they had merit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``They're not like any other eyes. They
seem trying to speak,--trying to speak kindly. I don't like other
people to look at me much, but I like you to look at me, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I think you're fonder of me than Tom is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, rather
sorrowfully. Then, wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could convince Philip that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could like him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) just as well, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was crooked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like me to kiss you, as I do Tom? I will, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much; nobody kisses me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) neck and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) quite earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall always remember you, and kiss you when
I see you again, if it's ever so long. But I'll go now, because I
think Mr. Askern's done with Tom's foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When their father came the second time, Maggie said to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
father, Philip Wakem is so very good to Tom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is such a clever boy,
and I _do_ love him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). And you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) too, Tom, don't you? _Say_ you
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added entreatingly.

<p/>Tom colored a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, and said: <div class="bookquote">``I sha'n't
be friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) when I leave school, father; but we've made it up
now, since my foot has been bad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s taught me to play at
draughts, and I can beat him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s good to you, try and make
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) amends, and be good to _him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a poor crooked creature, and
takes after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dead mother. But don't you be getting too thick with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's blood in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too. Ay, ay, the gray colt may
chance to kick like his (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) black sire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>The jarring natures of the two boys effected what Mr. Tulliver's
admonition alone might have failed to effect; in spite of Philip's new
kindness, and Tom's answering regard in this time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) trouble, they
never became close friends. When Maggie was gone, and when Tom
by-and-by began to walk about as usual, the friendly warmth that had
been kindled by pity and gratitude died out by degrees, and left them
in their old relation to each other. Philip was often peevish and
contemptuous; and Tom's more specific and kindly impressions gradually
melted into the old background of suspicion and dislike toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as
a queer fellow, a humpback, and the son of a rogue. If boys and men
are to be welded together in the glow of transient feeling, they must
be made of metal that will mix, else they inevitably fall asunder when
the heat dies out.



<p/>Chapter VII

<p/>The Golden Gates Are Passed


<p/>So Tom went on even to the fifth half-year--till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was turned
sixteen--at King's Lorton, while Maggie was growing with a rapidity
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunts considered highly reprehensible, at Miss Firniss's
boarding-school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss, with
cousin Lucy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) companion. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) early letters to Tom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
always sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) love to Philip, and asked many questions about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
which were answered by brief sentences about Tom's toothache, and a
turf-house which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was helping to build in the garden, with other
items of that kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays
that Philip was as queer as ever again, and often cross. They were no
longer very good friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) perceived; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reminded Tom
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ought always to love Philip for being so good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) when his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
foot was bad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``Well, it isn't my fault; _I_ don't do
anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of
their school-life; in the Midsummer holidays he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was always away at the
seaside, and at Christmas she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could only meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at long intervals in
the street of St. Ogg's. When they did meet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
promise to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>), but, as a young lady who had been at a
boarding-school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew now that such a greeting was out of the
question, and Philip would not expect it. The promise was void, like
so many other sweet, illusory promises of our childhood; void as
promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided, and when the
starry blossoms grew side by side with the ripening peach,--impossible
to be fulfilled when the golden gates had been passed.

<p/>But when their father was actually engaged in the long-threatened
lawsuit, and Wakem, as the agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry, was
acting against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), even Maggie felt, with some sadness, that they
were not likely ever to have any intimacy with Philip again; the very
name of Wakem made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father angry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had once heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say
that if that crook-backed son lived to inherit his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's ill-gotten
gains, there would be a curse upon him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Have as little to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>)
at school as you can, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said to Tom; and the command was
obeyed the more easily because Mr. Sterling by this time had two
additional pupils; for though this gentleman's rise in the world was
not of that meteor-like rapidity which the admirers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sterling</b></font>)
extemporaneous eloquence had expected for a preacher whose voice
demanded so wide a sphere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sterling</b></font>) had yet enough of growing prosperity to
enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Sterling</b></font>) to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Sterling</b></font>) expenditure in continued disproportion to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sterling</b></font>) income.

<p/>As for Tom's school course, it went on with mill-like monotony, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
mind continuing to move with a slow, half-stifled pulse in a medium
uninteresting or unintelligible ideas. But each vacation he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brought
home larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of
landscape, and water-colors in vivid greens, together with manuscript
books full of exercises and problems, in which the handwriting was all
the finer because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whole mind to it. Each vacation he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
brought home a new book or two, indicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) progress through
different stages of history, Christian doctrine, and Latin literature;
and that passage was not entirely without results, besides the
possession of the books. Tom's ear and tongue had become accustomed to
a great many words and phrases which are understood to be signs of an
educated condition; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had never really applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind to
any one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lessons, the lessons had left a deposit of vague,
fragmentary, ineffectual notions. Mr. Tulliver, seeing signs of
acquirement beyond the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own criticism, thought it was
probably all right with Tom's education; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) observed, indeed, that
there were no maps, and not enough <div class="bookquote">``summing'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made no formal
complaint to Mr. Stelling. It was a puzzling business, this schooling;
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) took Tom away, where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) send him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with better effect?

<p/>By the time Tom had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) last quarter at King's Lorton, the
years had made striking changes in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) since the day we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
returning from Mr. Jacobs's academy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a tall youth now, carrying
himself without the least awkwardness, and speaking without more
shyness than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tail-coat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stand-up collars, and watched the down
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lip with eager impatience, looking every day at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) virgin
razor, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had provided himself in the last holidays. Philip
had already left,--at the autumn quarter,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might go to the
south for the winter, for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) health; and this change
helped to give Tom the unsettled, exultant feeling that usually
belongs to the last months before leaving school. This quarter, too,
there was some hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's lawsuit being decided; _that_ made
the prospect of home more entirely pleasurable. For Tom, who had
gathered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) view of the case from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's conversation, had no
doubt that Pivart would be beaten.

<p/>Tom had not heard anything from home for some weeks,--a fact which did
not surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father and mother were not apt to manifest
their affection in unnecessary letters,--when, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) great surprise,
on the morning of a dark, cold day near the end of November, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
told, soon after entering the study at nine o'clock, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister
was in the drawing-room. It was Mrs. Stelling who had come into the
study to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to enter the drawing-room alone.

<p/>Maggie, too, was tall now, with braided and coiled hair; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
almost as tall as Tom, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was only thirteen; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) really
looked older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did at that moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had thrown off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
bonnet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heavy braids were pushed back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) forehead, as if it
would not bear that extra load, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) young face had a strangely
worn look, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes turned anxiously toward the door. When Tom
entered she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not speak, but only went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms round
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) earnestly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was used to various moods of
hers, and felt no alarm at the unusual seriousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how is it you're come so early this cold morning, Maggie? Did
you come in the gig?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) backed toward the sofa, and
drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I came by the coach. I've walked from the turnpike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how is it you're not at school? The holidays have not begun yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father wanted me at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with a slight trembling of
the lip. <div class="bookquote">``I came home three or four days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't my father well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, rather anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s very unhappy, Tom. The lawsuit is
ended, and I came to tell you because I thought it would be better for
you to know it before you came home, and I didn't like only to send
you a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father hasn't lost?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, hastily, springing from the sofa,
and standing before Maggie with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands suddenly thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with trembling.

<p/>Tom was silent a minute or two, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes fixed on the floor. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father will have to pay a good deal of money, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, rather faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it can't be helped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, bravely, not translating the
loss of a large sum of money into any tangible results. <div class="bookquote">``But my
father's very much vexed, I dare say?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, looking at Maggie,
and thinking that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) agitated face was only part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) girlish way
of taking things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, again faintly. Then, urged to fuller speech by
Tom's freedom from apprehension, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said loudly and rapidly, as if
the words _would_ burst from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will lose the mill and
the land and everything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will have nothing left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned
pale, and trembled visibly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said nothing, but sat down on the sofa
again, looking vaguely out of the opposite window.

<p/>Anxiety about the future had never entered Tom's mind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had
always ridden a good horse, kept a good house, and had the cheerful,
confident air of a man who has plenty of property to fall back upon.
Tom had never dreamed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father would <div class="bookquote">``fail'' (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>; _that_ was a form
of misfortune which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace,
and disgrace was an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not associate with any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
relations, least of all with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father. A proud sense of family
respectability was part of the very air Tom had been born and brought
up in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew there were people in St. Ogg's who made a show without
money to support it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always heard such people spoken of by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own friends with contempt and reprobation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a strong belief,
which was a lifelong habit, and required no definite evidence to rest
on, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father could spend a great deal of money if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chose; and
since his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) education at Mr. Stelling's had given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a more expensive
view of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had often thought that when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got older he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
make a figure in the world, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) horse and dogs and saddle, and
other accoutrements of a fine young man, and show himself equal to any
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contemporaries at St. Ogg's, who might consider themselves a
grade above him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in society because their fathers were professional
men, or had large oil-mills. As to the prognostics and headshaking of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunts and uncles, they had never produced the least effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
except to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think that aunts and uncles were disagreeable
society; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard them find fault in much the same way as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could remember. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father knew better than they did.

<p/>The down had come on Tom's lip, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thoughts and expectations had
been hitherto only the reproduction, in changed forms, of the boyish
dreams in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had lived three years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was awakened now with
a violent shock.

<p/>Maggie was frightened at Tom's pale, trembling silence. There was
something else to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),--something worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms round
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at last, and said, with a half sob:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom--dear, dear Tom, don't fret too much; try and bear it well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cheek passively to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) entreating kisses, and
there gathered a moisture in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) just rubbed away with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand. The action seemed to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shook himself and
said: <div class="bookquote">``I shall go home, with you, Maggie. Didn't my father say I was
to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Tom, father didn't wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anxiety about _his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_
feeling helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to master her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) agitation. What _would_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) do when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) all? <div class="bookquote">``But mother wants you to come,--poor mother!--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
cries so. Oh, Tom, it's very dreadful at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's lips grew whiter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to tremble almost as Tom had
done. The two poor things clung closer to each other, both
trembling,--the one at an unshapen fear, the other at the image of a
terrible certainty. When Maggie spoke, it was hardly above a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And--and--poor father--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie could not utter it. But the suspense was intolerable to Tom. A
vague idea of going to prison, as a consequence of debt, was the shape
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fears had begun to take.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my father?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said impatiently. <div class="bookquote">''_Tell_ me, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, finding it easier to reply to that
question. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``not himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fell off
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has known nobody but me ever since--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seems to have
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) senses. O father, father--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With these last words, Maggie's sobs burst forth with the more
violence for the previous struggle against them. Tom felt that
pressure of the heart which forbids tears; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had no distinct vision
of their troubles as Maggie had, who had been at home; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only felt
the crushing weight of what seemed unmitigated misfortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm almost convulsively round Maggie as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sobbed, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face looked rigid and tearless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes blank,--as if a black
curtain of cloud had suddenly fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) path.

<p/>But Maggie soon checked herself abruptly; a single thought had acted
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) like a startling sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must set out, Tom, we must not stay. Father will miss me; we must
be at the turnpike at ten to meet the coach.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said this with hasty
decision, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes, and rising to seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet.

<p/>Tom at once felt the same impulse, and rose too. <div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,
Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I must speak to Mr. Stelling, and then we'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must go to the study where the pupils were; but on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) met Mr. Stelling, who had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife that Maggie
appeared to be in trouble when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother, and now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought the brother and sister had been alone long enough, was
coming to inquire and offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sir, I must go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom said abruptly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) met Mr.
Stelling in the passage. <div class="bookquote">``I must go back with my sister directly. My
father's lost his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lawsuit--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) property--and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s very
ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Stelling felt like a kind-hearted man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) foresaw a probable money
loss for himself, but this had no appreciable share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) feeling,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) looked with grave pity at the brother and sister for whom
youth and sorrow had begun together. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) knew how Maggie had come,
and how eager she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to get home again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) hurried their departure,
only whispering something to Mrs. Stelling, who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>), and
who immediately left the room.

<p/>Tom and Maggie were standing on the door-step, ready to set out, when
Mrs. Stelling came with a little basket, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) hung on Maggie's
arm, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Do remember to eat something on the way, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie's
heart went out toward this woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never liked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) silently. It was the first sign within the poor child of
that new sense which is the gift of sorrow,--that susceptibility to
the bare offices of humanity which raises them into a bond of loving
fellowship, as to haggard men among the ice-bergs the mere presence of
an ordinary comrade stirs the deep fountains of affection.

<p/>Mr. Stelling put his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) hand on Tom's shoulder and said: <div class="bookquote">``God bless you,
my boy; let me know how you get on.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) pressed Maggie's hand;
but there were no audible good-byes. Tom had so often thought how
joyful he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should be the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left school <div class="bookquote">``for good'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>! And now his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
school years seemed like a holiday that had come to an end.

<p/>The two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant
road,--were soon lost behind the projecting hedgerow.

<p/>They had gone forth together into their life of sorrow, and they would
never more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares. They had
entered the thorny wilderness, and the golden gates of their childhood
had forever closed behind them.




<p/>Book III

<p/>_The Downfall_



<p/>Chapter I

<p/>What Had Happened at Home


<p/>When Mr. Tulliver first knew the fact that the lawsuit was decided
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant, every one who
happened to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Pivart</b></font>) at the time thought that, for so confident and
hot-tempered a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore the blow remarkably well. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought so
himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to show that if Wakem or anybody else
considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) crushed, they would find themselves mistaken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) could
not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) possessed to pay them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) appeared to himself to be
full of expedients by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) could ward off any results but such as
were tolerable, and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the
world. All the obstinacy and defiance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) nature, driven out of
their old channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate
formation of plans by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) would meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) difficulties, and remain
Mr. Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in spite of them. There was such a rush
of projects in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) brain, that it was no wonder his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) face was flushed
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) came away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) attorney, Mr. Gore, and
mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse to ride home from Lindum. There was Furley, who held
the mortgage on the land,--a reasonable fellow, who would see his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own
interest, Mr. Tulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not only
to purchase the whole estate, including the mill and homestead, but
would accept Mr. Tulliver as tenant, and be willing to advance money
to be repaid with high interest out of the profits of the business,
which would be made over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), Mr. Tulliver only taking enough
barely to maintain himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) family. Who would neglect such a
profitable investment? Certainly not Furley, for Mr. Tulliver had
determined that Furley should meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) plans with the utmost alacrity;
and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously heated
by the loss of a lawsuit, who are apt to see in their own interest or
desires a motive for other men's actions. There was no doubt -LRB-in the
miller's mind-RRB- that Furley would do just what was desirable; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
did--why, things would not be so very much worse. Mr. Tulliver and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
family must live more meagrely and humbly, but it would only be till
the profits of the business had paid off Furley's advances, and that
might be while Mr. Tulliver had still a good many years of life before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). It was clear that the costs of the suit could be paid without his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
being obliged to turn out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) old place, and look like a ruined
man. It was certainly an awkward moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) affairs. There was that
suretyship for poor Riley, who had died suddenly last April, and left
his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds,--a
fact which had helped to make Mr. Tulliver's banking book less
pleasant reading than a man might desire toward Christmas. Well! he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
had never been one of those poor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to
give a helping hand to a fellow-traveller in this puzzling world. The
really vexatious business was the fact that some months ago the
creditor who had lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) the five hundred pounds to repay Mrs. Glegg
had become uneasy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) money -LRB-set on by Wakem, of course-RRB-, and
Mr. Tulliver, still confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should gain his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) suit, and
finding it eminently inconvenient to raise the said sum until that
desirable issue had taken place, had rashly acceded to the demand that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should give a bill of sale on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) household furniture and some
other effects, as security in lieu of the bond. It was all one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
said to himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should soon pay off the money, and there was no
harm in giving that security any more than another. But now the
consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) in a new light, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) remembered that the time was close at hand when it would be
enforced unless the money were repaid. Two months ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would have
declared stoutly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would never be beholden to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife's
friends; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) told himself as stoutly that it was nothing but
right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain the
thing to them; they would hardly let Bessy's furniture be sold, and it
might be security to Pullet if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) advanced the money,--there would,
after all, be no gift or favor in the matter. Mr. Tulliver would never
have asked for anything from so poor-spirited a fellow for himself,
but Bessy might do so if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked.

<p/>It is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most
liable to shift their position and contradict themselves in this
sudden manner; everything is easier to them than to face the simple
fact that they have been thoroughly defeated, and must begin life
anew. And Mr. Tulliver, you perceive, though nothing more than a
superior miller and maltster, was as proud and obstinate as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
been a very lofty personage, in whom such dispositions might be a
source of that conspicuous, far-echoing tragedy, which sweeps the
stage in regal robes, and makes the dullest chronicler sublime. The
pride and obstinacy of millers and other insignificant people, whom
you pass unnoticingly on the road every day, have their tragedy too;
but it is of that unwept, hidden sort that goes on from generation to
generation, and leaves no record,--such tragedy, perhaps, as lies in
the conflicts of young souls, hungry for joy, under a lot made
suddenly hard to them, under the dreariness of a home where the
morning brings no promise with it, and where the unexpectant
discontent of worn and disappointed parents weighs on the children
like a damp, thick air, in which all the functions of life are
depressed; or such tragedy as lies in the slow or sudden death that
follows on a bruised passion, though it may be a death that finds only
a parish funeral. There are certain animals to which tenacity of
position is a law of life,--they can never flourish again, after a
single wrench: and there are certain human beings to whom predominance
is a law of life,--they can only sustain humiliation so long as they
can refuse to believe in it, and, in their own conception, predominate
still.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver was still predominating, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own imagination, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
approached St. Ogg's, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had to pass on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) way
homeward. But what was it that suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) saw the Laceham
coach entering the town, to follow it to the coach-office, and get the
clerk there to write a letter, requiring Maggie to come home the very
next day? Mr. Tulliver's own hand shook too much under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) excitement
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to write himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wanted the letter to be given to the
coachman to deliver at Miss Firniss's school in the morning. There was
a craving which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would not account for to himself, to have Maggie
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), without delay,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must come back by the coach to-morrow.

<p/>To Mrs. Tulliver, when he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) got home, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would admit no difficulties,
and scolded down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was
lost, by angry assertions that there was nothing to grieve about. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
said nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that night about the bill of sale and the
application to Mrs. Pullet, for he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) in ignorance of the
nature of that transaction, and had explained the necessity for taking
an inventory of the goods as a matter connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) will. The
possession of a wife conspicuously one's inferior in intellect is,
like other high privileges, attended with a few inconveniences, and,
among the rest, with the occasional necessity for using a little
deception.

<p/>The next day Mr. Tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon, on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) way to Mr. Gore's office at St. Ogg's. Gore was to have seen
Furley in the morning, and to have sounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) in relation to Mr.
Tulliver's affairs. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had not gone half-way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) met a clerk
from Mr. Gore's office, who was bringing a letter to Mr. Tulliver. Mr.
Gore had been prevented by a sudden call of business from waiting at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) office to see Mr. Tulliver, according to appointment, but would be
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) office at eleven to-morrow morning, and meanwhile had sent some
important information by letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, taking the letter, but not opening it. <div class="bookquote">``Then
tell Gore I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) to-morrow at eleven'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse.

<p/>The clerk, struck with Mr. Tulliver's glistening, excited glance,
looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) for a few moments, and then rode away. The reading of
a letter was not the affair of an instant to Mr. Tulliver; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) took in
the sense of a statement very slowly through the medium of written or
even printed characters; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had put the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pocket,
thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would open it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) armchair at home. But by-and-by it
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that there might be something in the letter Mrs.
Tulliver must not know about, and if so, it would be better to keep it
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sight altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse, took out the
letter, and read it. It was only a short letter; the substance was,
that Mr. Gore had ascertained, on secret, but sure authority, that
Furley had been lately much straitened for money, and had parted with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) securities,--among the rest, the mortgage on Mr. Tulliver's
property, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had transferred to--Wakem.

<p/>In half an hour after this Mr. Tulliver's own wagoner found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lying
by the roadside insensible, with an open letter near him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) gray
horse snuffing uneasily about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).

<p/>When Maggie reached home that evening, in obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's
call, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was no longer insensible. About an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had become
conscious, and after vague, vacant looks around him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), had muttered
something about <div class="bookquote">``a letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) presently repeated impatiently.
At the instance of Mr. Turnbull, the medical man, Gore's letter was
brought and laid on the bed, and the previous impatience seemed to be
allayed. The stricken man lay for some time with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes fixed on the
letter, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were trying to knit up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts by its help. But
presently a new wave of memory seemed to have come and swept the other
away; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes from the letter to the door, and after
looking uneasily, as if striving to see something his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were too
dim for, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``The little wench.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated the words impatiently from time to time, appearing
entirely unconscious of everything except this one importunate want,
and giving no sign of knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife or any one else; and poor Mrs.
Tulliver, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) feeble faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden
accumulation of troubles, went backward and forward to the gate to see
if the Laceham coach were coming, though it was not yet time.

<p/>But it came at last, and set down the poor anxious girl, no longer the
<div class="bookquote">``little wench,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl wench</b></font>)</div>except to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's fond memory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, what is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie said, with pale lips, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mother came toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) crying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't think her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father was ill,
because the letter had come at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dictation from the office at St.
Ogg's.

<p/>But Mr. Turnbull came now to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); a medical man is the good angel
of the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) remembered as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could remember anything, with a
trembling, questioning look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't alarm yourself too much, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Your father has had a sudden attack, and has not quite recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
memory. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been asking for you, and it will do him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good to see
you. Keep as quiet as you can; take off your things, and come upstairs
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie obeyed, with that terrible beating of the heart which makes
existence seem simply a painful pulsation. The very quietness with
which Mr. Turnbull spoke had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) susceptible imagination.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's eyes were still turned uneasily toward the door when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
entered and met the strange, yearning, helpless look that had been
seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in vain. With a sudden flash and movement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) raised
himself in the bed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rushed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>), and clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) with
agonized kisses.

<p/>Poor child! it was very early for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to know one of those supreme
moments in life when all we have hoped or delighted in, all we can
dread or endure, falls away from our regard as insignificant; is lost,
like a trivial memory, in that simple, primitive love which knits us
to the beings who have been nearest to us, in their times of
helplessness or of anguish.

<p/>But that flash of recognition had been too great a strain on the
father's bruised, enfeebled powers. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sank back again in renewed
insensibility and rigidity, which lasted for many hours, and was only
broken by a flickering return of consciousness, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took
passively everything that was given to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and seemed to have a sort
of infantine satisfaction in Maggie's near presence,--such
satisfaction as a baby has when it is returned to the nurse's lap.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sisters, and there was much wailing and
lifting up of hands below stairs. Both uncles and aunts saw that the
ruin of Bessy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) family was as complete as they had ever
foreboded it, and there was a general family sense that a judgment had
fallen on Mr. Tulliver, which it would be an impiety to counteract by
too much kindness. But Maggie heard little of this, scarcely ever
leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's bedside, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand
on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Mrs. Tulliver wanted to have Tom fetched home, and seemed to
be thinking more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) boy even than of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband; but the aunts
and uncles opposed this. Tom was better at school, since Mr. Turnbull
said there was no immediate danger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) believed. But at the end of the
second day, when Maggie had become more accustomed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's
fits of insensibility, and to the expectation that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would revive
from them, the thought of Tom had become urgent with _her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ too; and
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother sate crying at night and saying, <div class="bookquote">``My poor lad--it's
nothing but right he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) should come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Maggie said, <div class="bookquote">``Let me go for
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), mother; I'll go to-morrow morning if father doesn't
know me and want me. It would be so hard for Tom to come home and not
know anything about it beforehand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>And the next morning Maggie went, as we have seen. Sitting on the
coach on their way home, the brother and sister talked to each other
in sad, interrupted whispers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say Mr. Wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land, Tom,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``It was the letter with that news in it that made father
ill, they think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that scoundrel's been planning all along to ruin my
father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, leaping from the vaguest impressions to a definite
conclusion. <div class="bookquote">``I'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feel for it when I'm a man. Mind you never
speak to Philip again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a tone of sad remonstrance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no
spirit to dispute anything then, still less to vex Tom by opposing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).



<p/>Chapter II

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver's Teraphim, or Household Gods


<p/>When the coach set down Tom and Maggie, it was five hours since she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had started from home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was thinking with some trembling that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had perhaps missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and asked for <div class="bookquote">``the little wench''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>in
vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought of no other change that might have happened.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hurried along the gravel-walk and entered the house before Tom;
but in the entrance she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was startled by a strong smell of tobacco. The
parlor door was ajar; that was where the smell came from. It was very
strange; could any visitor be smoking at a time like this? Was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mother there? If so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must be told that Tom was come. Maggie, after
this pause of surprise, was only in the act of opening the door when
Tom came up, and they both looked into the parlor together.

<p/>There was a coarse, dingy man, of whose face Tom had some vague
recollection, sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's chair, smoking, with a jug and
glass beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>The truth flashed on Tom's mind in an instant. To <div class="bookquote">``have the bailiff in
the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``to be sold up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were phrases which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been used
to, even as a little boy; they were part of the disgrace and misery of
<div class="bookquote">``failing,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>of losing all one's money, and being ruined,--sinking into
the condition of poor working people. It seemed only natural this
should happen, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) property, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
thought of no more special cause for this particular form of
misfortune than the loss of the lawsuit. But the immediate presence of
this disgrace was so much keener an experience to Tom than the worst
form of apprehension, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt at this moment as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) real
trouble had only just begin; it was a touch on the irritated nerve
compared with its spontaneous dull aching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, taking the pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth,
with rough, embarrassed civility. The two young startled faces made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little uncomfortable.

<p/>But Tom turned away hastily without speaking; the sight was too
hateful. Maggie had not understood the appearance of this stranger, as
Tom had. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), whispering: <div class="bookquote">``Who can it be, Tom? What is
the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then, with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger
might have something to do with a change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rushed
upstairs, checking herself at the bedroom door to throw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
bonnet, and enter on tiptoe. All was silent there; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father was
lying, heedless of everything around him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes closed as when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). A servant was there, but not her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whispered. The servant did not know.

<p/>Maggie hastened out, and said to Tom; <div class="bookquote">``Father is lying quiet; let us
go and look for my mother. I wonder where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver was not downstairs, not in any of the bedrooms. There
was but one room below the attic which Maggie had left unsearched; it
was the storeroom, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother kept all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) linen and all the
precious <div class="bookquote">``best things''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>that were only unwrapped and brought out on
special occasions.

<p/>Tom, preceding Maggie, as they returned along the passage, opened the
door of this room, and immediately said, <div class="bookquote">``Mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver was seated there with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) laid-up treasures. One of
the linen chests was open; the silver teapot was unwrapped from its
many folds of paper, and the best china was laid out on the top of the
closed linen-chest; spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in rows
on the shelves; and the poor woman was shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and weeping,
with a bitter tension of the mouth, over the mark, <div class="bookquote">``Elizabeth Dodson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>on the corner of some tablecloths she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dropped them, and started up as Tom spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my boy, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) round the neck. <div class="bookquote">``To think
as I should live to see this day! We're ruined--everything's going to
be sold up--to think as your father should ha' married me to bring me
to this! We've got nothing--we shall be beggars--we must go to the
workhouse--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), then seated herself again, and took another tablecloth
on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap, unfolding it a little way to look at the pattern, while
the children stood by in mute wretchedness, their minds quite filled
for the moment with the words <div class="bookquote">``beggars''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``workhouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To think o' these cloths as I spun myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on, lifting
things out and turning them over with an excitement all the more
strange and piteous because the stout blond woman was usually so
passive,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been ruffled before, it was at the surface
merely,--<div class="bookquote">``and Job Haxey wove 'em, and brought the piece home on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
back, as I remember standing at the door and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) come, before I
ever thought o' marrying your father! And the pattern as I chose
myself, and bleached so beautiful, and I marked 'em so as nobody ever
saw such marking,--they must cut the cloth to get it out, for it's a
particular stitch. And they're all to be sold, and go into strange
people's houses, and perhaps be cut with the knives, and wore out
before I'm dead. You'll never have one of 'em, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said,
looking up at Tom with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes full of tears, <div class="bookquote">``and I meant 'em for
you. I wanted you to have all o' this pattern. Maggie could have had
the large check--it never shows so well when the dishes are on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was touched to the quick, but there was an angry reaction
immediately. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face flushed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But will my aunts let them be sold, mother? Do they know about it?
They'll never let your linen go, will they? Haven't you sent to them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I sent Luke directly they'd put the bailies in, and your aunt
Pullet's been--and, oh dear, oh dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cries so and says your
father's disgraced my family and made it the talk o' the country; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'ll buy the spotted cloths for herself, because she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s never had so
many as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wanted o' that pattern, and they sha'n't go to strangers,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s got more checks a`ready nor she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) can do with.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Here Mrs.
Tulliver began to lay back the tablecloths in the chest, folding and
stroking them automatically.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And your uncle Glegg's been too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
says things must be bought in for us to lie down on, but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) must talk
to your aunt; and they're all coming to consult. But I know they'll
none of 'em take my chany,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) added, turning toward the cups and
saucers, <div class="bookquote">``for they all found fault with 'em when I bought 'em, 'cause
o' the small gold sprig all over 'em, between the flowers. But there's
none of 'em got better chany, not even your aunt Pullet herself; and I
bought it wi' my own money as I'd saved ever since I was turned
fifteen; and the silver teapot, too,--your father never paid for 'em.
And to think as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should ha' married me, and brought me to this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver burst out crying afresh, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sobbed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
handkerchief at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes a few moments, but then removing it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said
in a deprecating way, still half sobbing, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) were called upon
to speak before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could command her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) voice,--

<p/>``And I _did_ say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) times and times, ``Whativer you do, don't go to
law,<div class="bookquote">'' and what more could I do? I've had to sit by while my own
fortin's been spent, and what should ha' been my children's, too.
You'll have niver a penny, my boy--but it isn't your poor mother's
fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put out one arm toward Tom, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) piteously with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
helpless, childish blue eyes. The poor lad went to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). For the first time Tom thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father
with some reproach. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) natural inclination to blame, hitherto kept
entirely in abeyance toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father by the predisposition to think
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) always right, simply on the ground that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was Tom Tulliver's
father, was turned into this new channel by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother's plaints; and
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) indignation against Wakem there began to mingle some
indignation of another sort. Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father might have helped
bringing them all down in the world, and making people talk of them
with contempt, but no one should talk long of Tom Tulliver with
contempt.

<p/>The natural strength and firmness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) nature was beginning to
assert itself, urged by the double stimulus of resentment against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
aunts, and the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) must behave like a man and take care of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't fret, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon be able to get
money; I'll get a situation of some sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, a little soothed. Then,
looking round sadly, <div class="bookquote">``But I shouldn't ha' minded so much if we could
ha' kept the things wi' my name on 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger. The implied
reproaches against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, who was lying there in a
sort of living death--neutralized all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pity for griefs about
tablecloths and china; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's account was
heightened by some egoistic resentment at Tom's silent concurrence
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother in shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) out from the common calamity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
become almost indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's habitual depreciation of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was keenly alive to any sanction of it, however passive,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might suspect in Tom. Poor Maggie was by no means made up of
unalloyed devotedness, but put forth large claims for herself where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loved strongly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) burst out at last in an agitated, almost
violent tone: <div class="bookquote">``Mother, how can you talk so; as if you cared only for
things with _your_ name on, and not for what has my father's name too;
and to care about anything but dear father himself!--when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s lying
there, and may never speak to us again. Tom, you ought to say so too;
you ought not to let any one find fault with my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, almost choked with mingled grief and anger, left the room, and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old place on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart went out to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with
a stronger movement than ever, at the thought that people would blame
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Maggie hated blame; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been blamed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life, and nothing
had come of it but evil tempers.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had always defended and excused her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loving
remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tenderness was a force within her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that would enable
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to do or bear anything for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake.

<p/>Tom was a little shocked at Maggie's outburst,--telling _him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_ as well
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother what it was right to do! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ought to have learned
better than have those hectoring, assuming manners, by this time. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) presently went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's room, and the sight there touched
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in a way that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous
hour. When Maggie saw how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was moved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat by the bed, and the two children forgot
everything else in the sense that they had one father and one sorrow.



<p/>Chapter III

<p/>The Family Council


<p/>It was at eleven o'clock the next morning that the aunts and uncles
came to hold their consultation. The fire was lighted in the large
parlor, and poor Mrs. Tulliver, with a confused impression that it was
a great occasion, like a funeral, unbagged the bell-rope tassels, and
unpinned the curtains, adjusting them in proper folds, looking round
and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head sadly at the polished tops and legs of the
tables, which sister Pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient
brightness.

<p/>Mr. Deane was not coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) was away on business; but Mrs. Deane
appeared punctually in that handsome new gig with the head to it, and
the livery-servant driving it, which had thrown so clear a light on
several traits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) character to some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) female friends in St.
Ogg's. Mr. Deane had been advancing in the world as rapidly as Mr.
Tulliver had been going down in it; and in Mrs. Deane's house the
Dodson linen and plate were beginning to hold quite a subordinate
position, as a mere supplement to the handsomer articles of the same
kind, purchased in recent years,--a change which had caused an
occasional coolness in the sisterly intercourse between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) and Mrs.
Glegg, who felt that Susan was getting <div class="bookquote">``like the rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>and there
would soon be little of the true Dodson spirit surviving except in
herself, and, it might be hoped, in those nephews who supported the
Dodson name on the family land, far away in the Wolds.

<p/>People who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those
immediately under our own eyes; and it seems superfluous, when we
consider the remote geographical position of the Ethiopians, and how
very little the Greeks had to do with them, to inquire further why
Homer calls them <div class="bookquote">``blameless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Homer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Deane was the first to arrive; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) seat in
the large parlor, Mrs. Tulliver came down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) comely face
a little distorted, nearly as it would have been if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had been
crying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not a woman who could shed abundant tears, except in
moments when the prospect of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) furniture became unusually
vivid, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) felt how unfitting it was to be quite calm under
present circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sister, what a world this is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) exclaimed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) entered;
<div class="bookquote">``what trouble, oh dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Deane was a thin-lipped woman, who made small well-considered
speeches on peculiar occasions, repeating them afterward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
husband, and asking him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had not spoken very properly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) said deliberately, <div class="bookquote">``this is a changing world, and
we don't know to-day what may happen tomorrow. But it's right to be
prepared for all things, and if trouble's sent, to remember as it
isn't sent without a cause. I'm very sorry for you as a sister, and if
the doctor orders jelly for Mr. Tulliver, I hope you'll let me know.
I'll send it willingly; for it is but right he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should have proper
attendance while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, rather faintly, withdrawing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) fat hand from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister's thin one. <div class="bookquote">``But there's been no talk o'
jelly yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then after a moment's pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``There's a dozen o'
cut jelly-glasses upstairs--I shall never put jelly into 'em no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) voice was rather agitated as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) uttered the last words, but the
sound of wheels diverted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) thoughts. Mr. and Mrs. Glegg were come,
and were almost immediately followed by Mr. and Mrs. Pullet.

<p/>Mrs. Pullet entered crying, as a compendious mode, at all times, of
expressing what were her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) views of life in general, and what, in brief,
were the opinions she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) held concerning the particular case before her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Glegg had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) fuzziest front, and garments which appeared to
have had a recent resurrection from rather a creasy form of burial; a
costume selected with the high moral purpose of instilling perfect
humility into Bessy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. G., won't you come nearer the fire?''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) husband, unwilling
to take the more comfortable seat without offering it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I've seated myself here, Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>this woman</b></font>)</div>returned this superior
woman; <div class="bookquote">''_you_ can roast yourself, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, seating himself good-humoredly, <div class="bookquote">``and how's the
poor man upstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Turnbull thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) a deal better this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) took more notice, and spoke to me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>)'s never known
Tom yet,--looks at the poor lad as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a stranger, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
said something once about Tom and the pony. The doctor says his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
memory's gone a long way back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doesn't know Tom because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s
thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was little. Eh dear, eh dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt it's the water got on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brain,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, turning
round from adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) cap in a melancholy way at the pier-glass.
<div class="bookquote">``It's much if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ever gets up again; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'ll most like
be childish, as Mr. Carr was, poor man! They fed him (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>) with a spoon as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>)'d been a babby for three year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>)'d quite lost the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>)
limbs; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>)'d got a Bath chair, and somebody to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>); and
that's what you won't have, I doubt, Bessy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister Pullet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, severely, <div class="bookquote">``if I understand right,
we've come together this morning to advise and consult about what's to
be done in this disgrace as has fallen upon the family, and not to
talk o' people as don't belong to us. Mr. Carr was none of our blood,
nor noways connected with us, as I've ever heared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, in a pleading tone, drawing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
gloves again, and stroking the fingers in an agitated manner, <div class="bookquote">``if
you've got anything disrespectful to say o' Mr. Carr, I do beg of you
as you won't say it to me. _I_ know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) added, with a
sigh; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>) breath was short to that degree as you could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Carr</b></font>) two
rooms off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, with indignant disgust, <div class="bookquote">``you _do_ talk o'
people's complaints till it's quite undecent. But I say again, as I
said before, I didn't come away from home to talk about acquaintances,
whether they'd short breath or long. If we aren't come together for
one to hear what the other `ull do to save a sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) children
from the parish, _I_ shall go back. _One_ can't act without the other,
I suppose; it isn't to be expected as _I_ should do everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see as you've been so very
forrard at doing. So far as I know, this is the first time as here
you've been, since it's been known as the bailiff's in the house; and
I was here yesterday, and looked at all Bessy's linen and things, and
I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) I'd buy in the spotted tablecloths. I couldn't speak
fairer; for as for the teapot as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) doesn't want to go out o' the
family, it stands to sense I can't do with two silver teapots, not if
it _hadn't_ a straight spout, but the spotted damask I was allays fond
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it could be managed so as my teapot and chany and the best
castors needn't be put up for sale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs. Tulliver,
beseechingly, <div class="bookquote">``and the sugar-tongs the first things ever I bought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that can't be helped, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``If one o' the
family chooses to buy 'em in, they can, but one thing must be bid for
as well as another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it isn't to be looked for,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Pullet, with unwonted
independence of idea, <div class="bookquote">``as your own family should pay more for things
nor they'll fetch. They may go for an old song by auction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, oh dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``to think o' my chany being
sold i' that way, and I bought it when I was married, just as you did
yours, Jane and Sophy; and I know you didn't like mine, because o' the
sprig, but I was fond of it; and there's never been a bit broke, for
I've washed it myself; and there's the tulips on the cups, and the
roses, as anybody might go and look at 'em for pleasure. You wouldn't
like _your_ chany to go for an old song and be broke to pieces, though
yours has got no color in it, Jane,--it's all white and fluted, and
didn't cost so much as mine. And there's the castors, sister Deane, I
can't think but you'd like to have the castors, for I've heard you say
they're pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've no objection to buy some of the best things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deane/Mrs. Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Deane, rather loftily; <div class="bookquote">``we can do with extra things in our house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deane/Mrs. Deane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Best things!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Glegg, with severity, which had gathered
intensity from her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) long silence. <div class="bookquote">``It drives me past patience to hear
you all talking o' best things, and buying in this, that, and the
other, such as silver and chany. You must bring your mind to your
circumstances, Bessy, and not be thinking o' silver and chany; but
whether you shall get so much as a flock-bed to lie on, and a blanket
to cover you, and a stool to sit on. You must remember, if you get
'em, it'll be because your friends have bought 'em for you, for you're
dependent upon _them_ for everything; for your husband lies there
helpless, and hasn't got a penny i' the world to call his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own. And
it's for your own good I say this, for it's right you should feel what
your state is, and what disgrace your husband's brought on your own
family, as you've got to look to for everything, and be humble in your
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Glegg paused, for speaking with much energy for the good of
others is naturally exhausting.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver, always borne down by the family predominance of sister
Jane, who had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wear the yoke of a younger sister in very
tender years, said pleadingly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, sister, I've never asked anybody to do anything, only buy
things as it `ud be a pleasure to 'em to have, so as they mightn't go
and be spoiled i' strange houses. I never asked anybody to buy the
things in for me and my children; though there's the linen I spun, and
I thought when Tom was born,--I thought one o' the first things when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was lying i' the cradle, as all the things I'd bought wi' my own
money, and been so careful of, `ud go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). But I've said nothing as
I wanted my sisters to pay their money for me. What my husband has
done for _his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)_ sister's unknown, and we should ha' been better off
this day if it hadn't been as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s lent money and never asked for it
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, kindly, <div class="bookquote">``don't let us make things too
dark. What's done can't be undone. We shall make a shift among us to
buy what's sufficient for you; though, as Mrs. G. says, they must be
useful, plain things. We mustn't be thinking o' what's unnecessary. A
table, and a chair or two, and kitchen things, and a good bed, and
such-like. Why, I've seen the day when I shouldn't ha' known myself if
I'd lain on sacking i`stead o' the floor. We get a deal o' useless
things about us, only because we've got the money to spend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. G., <div class="bookquote">``if you'll be kind enough to let me speak,
i`stead o' taking the words out o' my mouth,--I was going to say,
Bessy, as it's fine talking for you to say as you've never asked us to
buy anything for you; let me tell you, you _ought_ to have asked us.
Pray, how are you to be purvided for, if your own family don't help
you? You must go to the parish, if they didn't. And you ought to know
that, and keep it in mind, and ask us humble to do what we can for
you, i`stead o' saying, and making a boast, as you've never asked us
for anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talked o' the Mosses, and what Mr. Tulliver's done for 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said
uncle Pullet, who became unusually suggestive where advances of money
were concerned. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't _they_ been anear you? They ought to do
something as well as other folks; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s lent 'em money, they
ought to be made to pay it back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deane/Mrs. Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Deane; <div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking so. How is it
Mr. and Mrs. Moss aren't here to meet us? It is but right they should
do their share.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deane/Mrs. Deane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``I never sent 'em word about Mr.
Tulliver, and they live so back`ard among the lanes at Basset, they
niver hear anything only when Mr. Moss comes to market. But I niver
gave 'em a thought. I wonder Maggie didn't, though, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was allays
so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Moss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't your children come in, Bessy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, at the
mention of Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``They should hear what their aunts and uncles have
got to say; and Maggie,--when it's me as have paid for half her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
schooling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ought to think more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Pullet than of aunt
Moss. I may go off sudden when I get home to-day; there's no telling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd had _my_ way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``the children `ud ha' been in
the room from the first. It's time they knew who they've to look to,
and it's right as _somebody_ should talk to 'em, and let 'em know
their condition i' life, and what they're come down to, and make 'em
feel as they've got to suffer for their father's faults.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll go and fetch 'em, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, resignedly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was quite crushed now, and thought of the treasures in the
storeroom with no other feeling than blank despair.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) went upstairs to fetch Tom and Maggie, who were both in their
father's room, and was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way down again, when the sight of the
storeroom door suggested a new thought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went toward it, and
left the children to go down by themselves.

<p/>The aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the
brother and sister entered,--both with shrinking reluctance; for
though Tom, with a practical sagacity which had been roused into
activity by the strong stimulus of the new emotions he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had undergone
since yesterday, had been turning over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind a plan which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
meant to propose to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunts or uncles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt by no means
amicably toward them, and dreaded meeting them all at once as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would
have dreaded a large dose of concentrated physic, which was but just
endurable in small draughts. As for Maggie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was peculiarly
depressed this morning; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been called up, after brief rest, at
three o'clock, and had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from
watching in a sick-room through the chill hours of early twilight and
breaking day,--in which the outside day-light life seems to have no
importance, and to be a mere margin to the hours in the darkened
chamber. Their entrance interrupted the conversation. The shaking of
hands was a melancholy and silent ceremony, till uncle Pullet
observed, as Tom approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, young sir, we've been talking as we should want your pen and
ink; you can write rarely now, after all your schooling, I should
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Glegg, with admonition which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meant to be kind,
``we must look to see the good of all this schooling, as your father's
sunk so much money in, now,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When land is gone and money's spent,
Then learning is most excellent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now's the time, Tom, to let us see the good o' your learning. Let us
see whether you can do better than I can, as have made my fortin
without it. But I began wi' doing with little, you see; I could live
on a basin o' porridge and a crust o' bread-and-cheese. But I doubt
high living and high learning `ull make it harder for you, young man,
nor it was for me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>interposed aunt Glegg, energetically, <div class="bookquote">``whether
it's hard or no. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hasn't got to consider what's hard; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must
consider as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) isn't to trusten to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in idleness
and luxury; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got to bear the fruits of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's misconduct,
and bring his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind to fare hard and to work hard. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be
humble and grateful to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) aunts and uncles for what they're doing for
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother and father, as must be turned out into the streets and go
to the workhouse if they didn't help 'em. And his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sister, too,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Glegg, looking severely at Maggie, who had sat down on
the sofa by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Deane, drawn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
Lucy's mother, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must make up her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind to be humble and work; for
there'll be no servants to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) any more,--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must remember
that. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must do the work o' the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must respect and love
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) aunts as have done so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and saved their money to leave
to their nepheys and nieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was still standing before the table in the centre of the group.
There was a heightened color in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was very far from
looking humbled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was preparing to say, in a respectful tone,
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had previously meditated, when the door opened and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
mother re-entered.

<p/>Poor Mrs. Tulliver had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) hands a small tray, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) silver teapot, a specimen teacup and saucer, the castors,
and sugar-tongs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, looking at Mrs. Deane, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) set the
tray on the table, <div class="bookquote">``I thought, perhaps, if you looked at the teapot
again,--it's a good while since you saw it,--you might like the
pattern better; it makes beautiful tea, and there's a stand and
everything; you might use it for every day, or else lay it by for Lucy
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) goes to housekeeping. I should be so loath for 'em to buy it
at the Golden Lion,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the poor woman, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart swelling, and the
tears coming,--<div class="bookquote">``my teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think
of its being scratched, and set before the travellers and folks, and
my letters on it,--see here, E. D.,--and everybody to see 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head with deep
sadness, <div class="bookquote">``it's very bad,--to think o' the family initials going about
everywhere--it niver was so before; you're a very unlucky sister,
Bessy. But what's the use o' buying the teapot, when there's the linen
and spoons and everything to go, and some of 'em with your full
name,--and when it's got that straight spout, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to disgrace o' the family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``that can't be helped
wi' buying teapots. The disgrace is, for one o' the family to ha'
married a man as has brought her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to beggary. The disgrace is, as
they're to be sold up. We can't hinder the country from knowing that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had started up from the sofa at the allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, but
Tom saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) action and flushed face in time to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from
speaking. <div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said authoritatively, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
aside. It was a remarkable manifestation of self-command and practical
judgment in a lad of fifteen, that when his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) aunt Glegg ceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
began to speak in a quiet and respectful manner, though with a good
deal of trembling in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) voice; for his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother's words had cut him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to
the quick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, looking straight at Mrs. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``if you think
it's a disgrace to the family that we should be sold up, wouldn't it
be better to prevent it altogether? And if you and aunt Pullet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
continued, looking at the latter, <div class="bookquote">``think of leaving any money to me
and Maggie, wouldn't it be better to give it now, and pay the debt
we're going to be sold up for, and save my mother from parting with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) furniture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence for a few moments, for every one, including Maggie,
was astonished at Tom's sudden manliness of tone. Uncle Glegg was the
first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, young man, come now! You show some notion o' things. But
there's the interest, you must remember; your aunts get five per cent
on their money, and they'd lose that if they advanced it; you haven't
thought o' that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could work and pay that every year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, promptly. <div class="bookquote">``I'd do
anything to save my mother from parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done!''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Glegg, admiringly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been drawing Tom
out, rather than reflecting on the practicability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) proposal. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had produced the unfortunate result of irritating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Glegg!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said that lady, with angry sarcasm. <div class="bookquote">``It's pleasant
work for you to be giving my money away, as you've pretended to leave
at my own disposal. And my money, as was my own father's gift, and not
yours, Mr. Glegg; and I've saved it, and added to it myself, and had
more to put out almost every year, and it's to go and be sunk in other
folks' furniture, and encourage 'em in luxury and extravagance as
they've no means of supporting; and I'm to alter my will, or have a
codicil made, and leave two or three hundred less behind me when I
die,--me as have allays done right and been careful, and the eldest o'
the family; and my money's to go and be squandered on them as have had
the same chance as me, only they've been wicked and wasteful. Sister
Pullet, _you_ may do as you like, and you may let your husband rob you
back again o' the money he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s given you, but that isn't _my_ sperrit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La, Jane, how fiery you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you'll have
the blood in your head, and have to be cupped. I'm sorry for Bessy and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) children,--I'm sure I think of 'em o' nights dreadful, for I sleep
very bad wi' this new medicine,--but it's no use for me to think o'
doing anything, if you won't meet me half-way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's this to be considered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``It's no use to
pay off this debt and save the furniture, when there's all the law
debts behind, as `ud take every shilling, and more than could be made
out o' land and stock, for I've made that out from Lawyer Gore. We'd
need save our money to keep the poor man with, instead o' spending it
on furniture as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can neither eat nor drink. You _will_ be so hasty,
Jane, as if I didn't know what was reasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then speak accordingly, Mr. Glegg!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife, with slow, loud
emphasis, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) significantly.

<p/>Tom's countenance had fallen during this conversation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lip
quivered; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was determined not to give way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would behave like
a man. Maggie, on the contrary, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) momentary delight in Tom's
speech, had relapsed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) state of trembling indignation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mother had been standing close by Tom's side, and had been clinging to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had last spoken; Maggie suddenly started up and
stood in front of them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes flashing like the eyes of a young
lioness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) burst out, <div class="bookquote">``talking and interfering with
us and scolding us, if you don't mean to do anything to help my poor
mother--your own sister,--if you've no feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s in
trouble, and won't part with anything, though you would never miss it,
to save her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from pain? Keep away from us then, and don't come to find
fault with my father,--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was better than any of you; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was kind,--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would have helped _you_, if you had been in trouble. Tom and I don't
ever want to have any of your money, if you won't help my mother. We'd
rather not have it! We'll do without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, having hurled her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) defiance at aunts and uncles in this way,
stood still, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) large dark eyes glaring at them, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were
ready to await all consequences.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver was frightened; there was something portentous in this
mad outbreak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) did not see how life could go on after it. Tom was
vexed; it was no _use_ to talk so. The aunts were silent with surprise
for some moments. At length, in a case of aberration such as this,
comment presented itself as more expedient than any answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't seen the end o' your trouble wi' that child, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Pullet; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s beyond everything for boldness and unthankfulness.
It's dreadful. I might ha' let alone paying for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) schooling, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s worse nor ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no more than what I've allays said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>followed Mrs. Glegg. ``Other
folks may be surprised, but I'm not. I've said over and over
again,--years ago I've said,--``Mark my words; that child `ull come to
no good; there isn't a bit of our family in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">'' And as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
having so much schooling, I never thought well o' that. I'd my reasons
when I said _I_ wouldn't pay anything toward it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``let's waste no more time in
talking,--let's go to business. Tom, now, get the pen and ink--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>While Mr. Glegg was speaking, a tall dark figure was seen hurrying
past the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's Mrs. Moss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``The bad news must ha'
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>), then'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) went out to open the door, Maggie eagerly
following her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) can agree to the list o'
things to be bought in. It's but right she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) should do her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) share when
it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) own brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Moss was in too much agitation to resist Mrs. Tulliver's
movement, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) into the parlor automatically, without
reflecting that it was hardly kind to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) among so many persons
in the first painful moment of arrival. The tall, worn, dark-haired
woman was a strong contrast to the Dodson sisters as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) entered in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) shabby dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) shawl and bonnet looking as if they had
been hastily huddled on, and with that entire absence of
self-consciousness which belongs to keenly felt trouble. Maggie was
clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm; and Mrs. Moss seemed to notice no one else except
Tom, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) went straight up to and took by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear children,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) burst out, <div class="bookquote">``you've no call to think well
o' me; I'm a poor aunt to you, for I'm one o' them as take all and
give nothing. How's my poor brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Turnbull thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>)'ll get better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down, aunt
Gritty. Don't fret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my sweet child, I feel torn i' two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, allowing
Maggie to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to the sofa, but still not seeming to notice the
presence of the rest. <div class="bookquote">``We've three hundred pounds o' my brother's
money, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wants it, and you all want it, poor things!--and yet
we must be sold up to pay it, and there's my poor children,--eight of
'em, and the little un of all can't speak plain. And I feel as if I
was a robber. But I'm sure I'd no thought as my brother--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor woman was interrupted by a rising sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three hundred pounds! oh dear, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, who, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband had done <div class="bookquote">``unknown''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>things for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
sister, had not had any particular sum in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind, and felt a wife's
irritation at having been kept in the dark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What madness, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``A man with a family!
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d no right to lend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money i' that way; and without security,
I'll be bound, if the truth was known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Glegg's voice had arrested Mrs. Moss's attention, and looking up,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there _was_ security; my husband gave a note for it. We're not
that sort o' people, neither of us, as `ud rob my brother's children;
and we looked to paying back the money, when the times got a bit
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, gently, <div class="bookquote">``hasn't your husband no way
o' raising this money? Because it `ud be a little fortin, like, for
these folks, if we can do without Tulliver's being made a bankrupt.
Your husband's got stock; it is but right he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should raise the money,
as it seems to me,--not but what I'm sorry for you, Mrs. Moss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, you don't know what bad luck my husband's had with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
stock. The farm's suffering so as never was for want o' stock; and
we've sold all the wheat, and we're behind with our rent,--not but
what we'd like to do what's right, and I'd sit up and work half the
night, if it `ud be any good; but there's them poor children,--four of
'em such little uns--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry so, aunt; don't fret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>whispered Maggie, who had kept hold
of Mrs. Moss's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Mr. Tulliver let you have the money all at once?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver, still lost in the conception of things which had been <div class="bookquote">``going
on''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>without her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knowledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; at twice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) eyes and making an effort
to restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``The last was after my bad illness four years
ago, as everything went wrong, and there was a new note made then.
What with illness and bad luck, I've been nothing but cumber all my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Moss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, with decision, <div class="bookquote">``yours is a very
unlucky family; the more's the pity for _my_ sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I set off in the cart as soon as ever I heard o' what had happened,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, looking at Mrs. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``I should never ha' stayed
away all this while, if you'd thought well to let me know. And it
isn't as I'm thinking all about ourselves, and nothing about my
brother, only the money was so on my mind, I couldn't help speaking
about it. And my husband and me desire to do the right thing, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) added, looking at Mr. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``and we'll make shift and pay the
money, come what will, if that's all my brother's got to trust to.
We've been used to trouble, and don't look for much else. It's only
the thought o' my poor children pulls me i' two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's this to be thought on, Mrs. Moss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``and
it's right to warn you,--if Tulliver's made a bankrupt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s got a
note-of-hand of your husband's for three hundred pounds, you'll be
obliged to pay it; th' assignees `ull come on you for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, oh dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, thinking of the bankruptcy,
and not of Mrs. Moss's concern in it. Poor Mrs. Moss herself listened
in trembling submission, while Maggie looked with bewildered distress
at Tom to see if _he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_ showed any signs of understanding this trouble,
and caring about poor aunt Moss. Tom was only looking thoughtful, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes on the tablecloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) isn't made bankrupt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``as I said
before, three hundred pounds `ud be a little fortin for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), poor man.
We don't know but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) may be partly helpless, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) ever gets up
again. I'm very sorry if it goes hard with you, Mrs. Moss, but my
opinion is, looking at it one way, it'll be right for you to raise the
money; and looking at it th' other way, you'll be obliged to pay it.
You won't think ill o' me for speaking the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, looking up suddenly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meditative view of the
tablecloth, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would be right for my aunt Moss to pay
the money if it would be against my father's will for her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) to pay it;
would it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Glegg looked surprised for a moment or two before he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Why,
no, perhaps not, Tom; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d ha' destroyed the note, you know.
We must look for the note. What makes you think it `ud be against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, coloring, but trying to speak firmly, in spite of a
boyish tremor, <div class="bookquote">``I remember quite well, before I went to school to Mr.
Stelling, my father said to me one night, when we were sitting by the
fire together, and no one else was in the room--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom hesitated a little, and then went on.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said something to me about Maggie, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said: ``I've always
been good to my sister, though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) married against my will, and I've
lent Moss money; but I shall never think of distressing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to pay it;
I'd rather lose it. My children must not mind being the poorer for
that.<div class="bookquote">'' And now my father's ill, and not able to speak for himself, I
shouldn't like anything to be done contrary to what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but then, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Glegg, whose good feeling led him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>)
to enter into Tom's wish, but who could not at once shake off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
habitual abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying securities, or
alienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference
in a man's property, <div class="bookquote">``we should have to make away wi' the note, you
know, if we're to guard against what may happen, supposing your
father's made bankrupt--''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, severely, <div class="bookquote">``mind what you're saying.
You're putting yourself very forrard in other folks's business. If you
speak rash, don't say it was my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's such a thing as I never heared of before,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Pullet,
who had been making haste with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) lozenge in order to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
amazement,--<div class="bookquote">``making away with a note! I should think anybody could set
the constable on you for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, <div class="bookquote">``if the note's worth all that money,
why can't we pay it away, and save my things from going away? We've no
call to meddle with your uncle and aunt Moss, Tom, if you think your
father `ud be angry when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gets well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver had not studied the question of exchange, and was
straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind after original ideas on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh, pooh! you women don't understand these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said
uncle Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``There's no way o' making it safe for Mr. and Mrs. Moss
but destroying the note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I hope you'll help me do it, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``If my
father shouldn't get well, I should be very unhappy to think anything
had been done against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will that I could hinder. And I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
meant me to remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said that evening. I ought to obey my
father's wish about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Mrs. Glegg could not withhold her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) approval from Tom's words; she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
felt that the Dodson blood was certainly speaking in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), though, if
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had been a Dodson, there would never have been this wicked
alienation of money. Maggie would hardly have restrained herself from
leaping on Tom's neck, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Moss had not prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by
herself rising and taking Tom's hand, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, with rather a
choked voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll never be the poorer for this, my dear boy, if there's a God
above; and if the money's wanted for your father, Moss and me `ull pay
it, the same as if there was ever such security. We'll do as we'd be
done by; for if my children have got no other luck, they've got an
honest father and mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, who had been meditating after Tom's words, <div class="bookquote">``we
shouldn't be doing any wrong by the creditors, supposing your father
_was_ bankrupt. I've been thinking o' that, for I've been a creditor
myself, and seen no end o' cheating. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant to give your aunt the
money before ever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got into this sad work o' lawing, it's the same
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d made away with the note himself; for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind
to be that much poorer. But there's a deal o' things to be considered,
young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, <div class="bookquote">``when you
come to money business, and you may be taking one man's dinner away to
make another man's breakfast. You don't understand that, I doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``I know if I owe money to one man,
I've no right to give it to another. But if my father had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
mind to give my aunt the money before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in debt, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a right
to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, young man! I didn't think you'd been so sharp,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle
Glegg, with much candor. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps your father _did_ make away with
the note. Let us go and see if we can find it in the chest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's in my father's room. Let us go too, aunt Gritty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>whispered
Maggie.



<p/>Chapter IV

<p/>A Vanishing Gleam


<p/>Mr. Tulliver, even between the fits of spasmodic rigidity which had
recurred at intervals ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had been found fallen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
horse, was usually in so apathetic a condition that the exits and
entrances into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) room were not felt to be of great importance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
had lain so still, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes closed, all this morning, that Maggie
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Moss she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must not expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father to take any notice
of them.

<p/>They entered very quietly, and Mrs. Moss took her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) seat near the head
of the bed, while Maggie sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old place on the bed, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's without causing any change in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face.

<p/>Mr. Glegg and Tom had also entered, treading softly, and were busy
selecting the key of the old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had
brought from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's bureau. They succeeded in opening the
chest,--which stood opposite the foot of Mr. Tulliver's bed,--and
propping the lid with the iron holder, without much noise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a tin box,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>whispered Mr. Glegg; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d most like put a small
thing like a note in there. Lift it out, Tom; but I'll just lift up
these deeds,--they're the deeds o' the house and mill, I suppose,--and
see what there is under 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Glegg had lifted out the parchments, and had fortunately drawn
back a little, when the iron holder gave way, and the heavy lid fell
with a loud bang that resounded over the house.

<p/>Perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of
the strong vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the
frame of the prostrate man, and for the time completely shook off the
obstruction of paralysis. The chest had belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
father's father, and it had always been rather a solemn business to
visit it. All long-known objects, even a mere window fastening or a
particular door-latch, have sounds which are a sort of recognized
voice to us,--a voice that will thrill and awaken, when it has been
used to touch deep-lying fibres. In the same moment, when all the eyes
in the room were turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) started up and looked at the
chest, the parchments in Mr. Glegg's hand, and Tom holding the tin
box, with a glance of perfect consciousness and recognition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do with those deeds?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ordinary
tone of sharp questioning whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was irritated. <div class="bookquote">``Come here, Tom.
What do you do, going to my chest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom obeyed, with some trembling; it was the first time his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had
recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But instead of saying anything more to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father
continued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at Mr.
Glegg and the deeds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's been happening, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said sharply. <div class="bookquote">``What are you meddling
with my deeds for? Is Wakem laying hold of everything? Why don't you
tell me what you've been a-doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) added impatiently, as Mr. Glegg
advanced to the foot of the bed before speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, friend Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, in a soothing tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Nobody's getting hold of anything as yet. We only came to look and
see what was in the chest. You've been ill, you know, and we've had to
look after things a bit. But let's hope you'll soon be well enough to
attend to everything yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver looked around him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) meditatively, at Tom, at Mr. Glegg, and
at Maggie; then suddenly appearing aware that some one was seated by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) side at the head of the bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) turned sharply round and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Gritty!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, in the half-sad, affectionate tone in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
had been wont to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What! you're there, are you? How could
you manage to leave the children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said good Mrs. Moss, too impulsive to be prudent, <div class="bookquote">``I'm
thankful I'm come now to see you yourself again; I thought you'd never
know us any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! have I had a stroke?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, anxiously, looking at
Mr. Glegg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fall from your horse--shook you a bit,--that's all, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``But you'll soon get over it, let's hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) eyes on the bed-clothes, and remained silent
for two or three minutes. A new shadow came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) looked
up at Maggie first, and said in a lower tone, <div class="bookquote">``You got the letter,
then, my wench?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) with a full heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt as if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father were come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from the dead, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yearning to
show him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had always loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could be fulfilled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, so preoccupied that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) received the
kiss as passively as some quiet animal might have received it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s downstairs with my aunts, father. Shall I fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay; poor Bessy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes turned toward Tom as Maggie left
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to take care of 'em both if I die, you know, Tom. You'll
be badly off, I doubt. But you must see and pay everybody. And
mind,--there's fifty pound o' Luke's as I put into the business,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
gave me a bit at a time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s got nothing to show for it. You must
pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) first thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Glegg involuntarily shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) head, and looked more concerned
than ever, but Tom said firmly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father. And haven't you a note from my uncle Moss for three
hundred pounds? We came to look for that. What do you wish to be done
about it, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I'm glad you thought o' that, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``I
allays meant to be easy about that money, because o' your aunt. You
mustn't mind losing the money, if they can't pay it,--and it's like
enough they can't. The note's in that box, mind! I allays meant to be
good to you, Gritty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister; <div class="bookquote">``but
you know you aggravated me when you would have Moss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Maggie re-entered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, who came in much
agitated by the news that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband was quite himself again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you must forgive me if
you're worse off than you ever expected to be. But it's the fault o'
the law,--it's none o' mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) added angrily. <div class="bookquote">``It's the fault o'
raskills. Tom, you mind this: if ever you've got the chance, you make
Wakem smart. If you don't, you're a good-for-nothing son. You might
horse-whip him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'d set the law on you,--the law's made to take
care o' raskills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver was getting excited, and an alarming flush was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
face. Mr. Glegg wanted to say something soothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was prevented
by Mr. Tulliver's speaking again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``They'll make a shift to
pay everything, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and yet leave you your furniture;
and your sisters'll do something for you--and Tom'll grow up--though
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s to be I don't know--I've done what I could--I've given him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a
eddication--and there's the little wench, she (<font color='blue'><b>sisters</b></font>)'ll get married--but it's
a poor tale--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted, and with
the last words the poor man fell again, rigid and insensible. Though
this was only a recurrence of what had happened before, it struck all
present as if it had been death, not only from its contrast with the
completeness of the revival, but because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words had all had
reference to the possibility that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death was near. But with poor
Tulliver death was not to be a leap; it was to be a long descent under
thickening shadows.

<p/>Mr. Turnbull was sent for; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) heard what had passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) said
this complete restoration, though only temporary, was a hopeful sign,
proving that there was no permanent lesion to prevent ultimate
recovery.

<p/>Among the threads of the past which the stricken man had gathered up,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had omitted the bill of sale; the flash of memory had only lit up
prominent ideas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank into forgetfulness again with half his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
humiliation unlearned.

<p/>But Tom was clear upon two points,--that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Moss's note must be
destroyed; and that Luke's money must be paid, if in no other way, out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) own and Maggie's money now in the savings bank. There were
subjects, you perceive, on which Tom was much quicker than on the
niceties of classical construction, or the relations of a mathematical
demonstration.



<p/>Chapter V

<p/>Tom Applies His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Knife to the Oyster


<p/>The next day, at ten o'clock, Tom was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way to St. Ogg's, to see
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Deane, who was to come home last night, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunt had said;
and Tom had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Deane was the right person
to ask for advice about getting some employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was in a great way
of business; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not the narrow notions of uncle Glegg; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
risen in the world on a scale of advancement which accorded with Tom's
ambition.

<p/>It was a dark, chill, misty morning, likely to end in rain,--one of
those mornings when even happy people take refuge in their hopes. And
Tom was very unhappy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt the humiliation as well as the
prospective hardships of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lot with all the keenness of a proud
nature; and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resolute dutifulness toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father there
mingled an irrepressible indignation against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) which gave misfortune
the less endurable aspect of a wrong. Since these were the
consequences of going to law, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father was really blamable, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
aunts and uncles had always said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was; and it was a significant
indication of Tom's character, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunts ought
to do something more for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt nothing like Maggie's
violent resentment against them for showing no eager tenderness and
generosity. There were no impulses in Tom that led him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to expect what
did not present itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as a right to be demanded. Why should
people give away their money plentifully to those who had not taken
care of their own money? Tom saw some justice in severity; and all the
more, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had confidence in himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should never
deserve that just severity. It was very hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should
be put at this disadvantage in life by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's want of prudence;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not going to complain and to find fault with people because
they did not make everything easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would ask no one to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), more than to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) work and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for it. Poor Tom was not
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hopes to take refuge in under the chill damp imprisonment
of the December fog, which seemed only like a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) home
troubles. At sixteen, the mind that has the strongest affinity for
fact cannot escape illusion and self-flattery; and Tom, in sketching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) future, had no other guide in arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) facts than the
suggestions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own brave self-reliance. Both Mr. Glegg and Mr.
Deane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) knew, had been very poor once; he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) did not want to save money
slowly and retire on a moderate fortune like his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) uncle Glegg, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
would be like his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) uncle Deane--get a situation in some great house of
business and rise fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had scarcely seen anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) uncle
Deane for the last three years--the two families had been getting
wider apart; but for this very reason Tom was the more hopeful about
applying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Glegg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt sure, would never encourage
any spirited project, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a vague imposing idea of the
resources at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Deane's command. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father say,
long ago, how Deane had made himself so valuable to Guest & Co. that
they were glad enough to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Co.</b></font>) a share in the business; that was
what Tom resolved _he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_ would do. It was intolerable to think of being
poor and looked down upon all one's life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would provide for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
mother and sister, and make every one say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a man of high
character. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leaped over the years in this way, and, in the haste of
strong purpose and strong desire, did not see how they would be made
up of slow days, hours, and minutes.

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had crossed the stone bridge over the Floss and was
entering St. Ogg's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) was thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) would buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) father's
mill and land again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) was rich enough, and improve the house and
live there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) should prefer it to any smarter, newer place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>)
could keep as many horses and dogs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) liked.

<p/>Walking along the street with a firm, rapid step, at this point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>)
reverie he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) was startled by some one who had crossed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>)
notice, and who said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) in a rough, familiar voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Master Tom, how's your father this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was a publican
of St. Ogg's, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) father's customers.

<p/>Tom disliked being spoken to just then; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said civilly, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s
still very ill, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, it's been a sore chance for you, young man, hasn't it,--this
lawsuit turning out against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>said the publican, with a confused,
beery idea of being good-natured.

<p/>Tom reddened and passed on; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have felt it like the handling of
a bruise, even if there had been the most polite and delicate
reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Tulliver's son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>said the publican to a grocer standing on the
adjacent door-step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the grocer</b></font>)</div>said the grocer, <div class="bookquote">``I thought I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) features. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) takes after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mother's family; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a Dodson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s a fine, straight youth;
what's he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) been brought up to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the grocer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! to turn up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) nose at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) father's customers, and be a fine
gentleman,--not much else, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, roused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dream of the future to a thorough consciousness
of the present, made all the greater haste to reach the warehouse
offices of Guest & Co., where he (<font color='blue'><b>Co.</b></font>) expected to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Co.</b></font>) uncle Deane. But
this was Mr. Deane's morning at the band, a clerk told him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>), and with
some contempt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) ignorance; Mr. Deane was not to be found in
River Street on a Thursday morning.

<p/>At the bank Tom was admitted into the private room where his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle
was, immediately after sending in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name. Mr. Deane was auditing
accounts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) looked up as Tom entered, and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Tom, nothing fresh the matter at home, I hope? How's your
father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much the same, thank you, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, feeling nervous. <div class="bookquote">``But I
want to speak to you, please, when you're at liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, relapsing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) accounts, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) and the managing-clerk remained so absorbed for the next
half-hour that Tom began to wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should have to sit in
this way till the bank closed,--there seemed so little tendency toward
a conclusion in the quiet, monotonous procedure of these sleek,
prosperous men of business. Would his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a place in the
bank? It would be very dull, prosy work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, writing there
forever to the loud ticking of a timepiece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) preferred some other
way of getting rich. But at last there was a change; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle took a
pen and wrote something with a flourish at the end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll just step up to Torry's now, Mr. Spence, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Deane, and the clock suddenly became less loud and deliberate in Tom's
ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, when they were alone, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
substantial person a little in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) chair, and taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
snuff-box; <div class="bookquote">``what's the business, my boy; what's the business?''  (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Deane, who had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) wife what had passed the day before,
thought Tom was come to appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for some means of averting the
sale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll excuse me for troubling you, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom,
coloring, but speaking in a tone which, though, tremulous, had a
certain proud independence in it; <div class="bookquote">``but I thought you were the best
person to advise me what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, reserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) pinch of snuff, and looking at Tom
with new attention, <div class="bookquote">``let us hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to get a situation, uncle, so that I may earn some money,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who never fell into circumlocution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A situation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, and then took his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) pinch of snuff with
elaborate justice to each nostril. Tom thought snuff-taking a most
provoking habit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, let me see, how old are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) threw
himself backward again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sixteen; I mean, I am going in seventeen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, hoping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle
noticed how much beard he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see; your father had some notion of making you an engineer, I
think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't think I could get any money at that for a long while,
could I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true; but people don't get much money at anything, my boy,
when they're only sixteen. You've had a good deal of schooling,
however; I suppose you're pretty well up in accounts, eh? You
understand book keeping?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, rather falteringly. <div class="bookquote">``I was in Practice. But Mr.
Stelling says I write a good hand, uncle. That's my writing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>added
Tom, laying on the table a copy of the list he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had made yesterday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that's good, that's good. But, you see, the best hand in the
world'll not get you a better place than a copying-clerk's, if you
know nothing of book-keeping,--nothing of accounts. And a
copying-clerk's a cheap article. But what have you been learning at
school, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane had not occupied himself with methods of education, and had
no precise conception of what went forward in expensive schools.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We learned Latin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, pausing a little between each item, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were turning over the books in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) school-desk to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
memory,--<div class="bookquote">``a good deal of Latin; and the last year I did Themes, one
week in Latin and one in English; and Greek and Roman history; and
Euclid; and I began Algebra, but I left it off again; and we had one
day every week for Arithmetic. Then I used to have drawing-lessons;
and there were several other books we either read or learned out
of,--English Poetry, and Horæ Paulinæ and Blair's Rhetoric, the last
half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) snuff-box again and screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) mouth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) felt
in the position of many estimable persons when they had read the New
Tariff, and found how many commodities were imported of which they
knew nothing; like a cautious man of business, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not going to
speak rashly of a raw material in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had no experience. But
the presumption was, that if it had been good for anything, so
successful a man as himself would hardly have been ignorant of it.

<p/>About Latin he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had an opinion, and thought that in case of another
war, since people would no longer wear hair-powder, it would be well
to put a tax upon Latin, as a luxury much run upon by the higher
classes, and not telling at all on the ship-owning department. But,
for what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew, the Horæ Paulinæ might be something less neutral. On
the whole, this list of acquirements gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sort of repulsion
toward poor Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said at last, in rather a cold, sardonic tone, <div class="bookquote">``you've had
three years at these things,--you must be pretty strong in 'em. Hadn't
you better take up some line where they'll come in handy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom colored, and burst out, with new energy:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather not have any employment of that sort, uncle. I don't like
Latin and those things. I don't know what I could do with them unless
I went as usher in a school; and I don't know them well enough for
that! besides, I would as soon carry a pair of panniers. I don't want
to be that sort of person. I should like to enter into some business
where I can get on,--a manly business, where I should have to look
after things, and get credit for what I did. And I shall want to keep
my mother and sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, young gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, with that tendency to repress
youthful hopes which stout and successful men of fifty find one of
their easiest duties, <div class="bookquote">``that's sooner said than done,--sooner said than
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>stout men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But didn't _you_ get on in that way, uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, a little
irritated that Mr. Deane did not enter more rapidly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) views. <div class="bookquote">``I
mean, didn't you rise from one place to another through your abilities
and good conduct?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, spreading himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) chair a
little, and entering with great readiness into a retrospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) own
career. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll tell you how I got on. It wasn't by getting astride
a stick and thinking it would turn into a horse if I sat on it long
enough. I kept my eyes and ears open, sir, and I wasn't too fond of my
own back, and I made my master's interest my own. Why, with only
looking into what went on in the mill, I found out how there was a
waste of five hundred a-year that might be hindered. Why, sir, I
hadn't more schooling to begin with than a charity boy; but I saw
pretty soon that I couldn't get on far enough without mastering
accounts, and I learned 'em between working hours, after I'd been
unlading. Look here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>Mr. Deane opened a book and pointed to the page.
<div class="bookquote">``I write a good hand enough, and I'll match anybody at all sorts of
reckoning by the head; and I got it all by hard work, and paid for it
out of my own earnings,--often out of my own dinner and supper. And I
looked into the nature of all the things we had to do in the business,
and picked up knowledge as I went about my work, and turned it over in
my head. Why, I'm no mechanic,--I never pretended to be--but I've
thought of a thing or two that the mechanics never thought of, and
it's made a fine difference in our returns. And there isn't an article
shipped or unshipped at our wharf but I know the quality of it. If I
got places, sir, it was because I made myself fit for 'em. If you want
to slip into a round hole, you must make a ball of yourself; that's
where it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) box again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had been led on by pure enthusiasm
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) subject, and had really forgotten what bearing this
retrospective survey had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) listener. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had found occasion for
saying the same thing more than once before, and was not distinctly
aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) port-wine before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with a slight complaint in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tone, <div class="bookquote">``that's
what I should like to do. Can't _I_ get on in the same way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the same way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, eyeing Tom with quiet deliberation.
<div class="bookquote">``There go two or three questions to that, Master Tom. That depends on
what sort of material you are, to begin with, and whether you've been
put into the right mill. But I'll tell you what it is. Your poor
father went the wrong way to work in giving you an education. It
wasn't my business, and I didn't interfere; but it is as I thought it
would be. You've had a sort of learning that's all very well for a
young fellow like our Mr. Stephen Guest, who'll have nothing to do but
sign checks all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) life, and may as well have Latin inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) head
as any other sort of stuffing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why the Latin need
hinder me from getting on in business. I shall soon forget it all; it
makes no difference to me. I had to do my lessons at school, but I
always thought they'd never be of any use to me afterward; I didn't
care about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, that's all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane; <div class="bookquote">``but it doesn't alter
what I was going to say. Your Latin and rigmarole may soon dry off
you, but you'll be but a bare stick after that. Besides, it's whitened
your hands and taken the rough work out of you. And what do you know?
Why, you know nothing about book-keeping, to begin with, and not so
much of reckoning as a common shopman. You'll have to begin at a low
round of the ladder, let me tell you, if you mean to get on in life.
It's no use forgetting the education your father's been paying for, if
you don't give yourself a new un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips hard; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt as if the tears were rising, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
would rather die than let them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want me to help you to a situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>Mr. Deane went on; <div class="bookquote">``well,
I've no fault to find with that. I'm willing to do something for you.
But you youngsters nowadays think you're to begin with living well and
working easy; you've no notion of running afoot before you get
horseback. Now, you must remember what you are,--you're a lad of
sixteen, trained to nothing particular. There's heaps of your sort,
like so many pebbles, made to fit in nowhere. Well, you might be
apprenticed to some business,--a chemist's and druggist's perhaps;
your Latin might come in a bit there--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was going to speak, but Mr. Deane put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) hand and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop! hear what I've got to say. You don't want to be a `prentice,--I
know, I know,--you want to make more haste, and you don't want to
stand behind a counter. But if you're a copying-clerk, you'll have to
stand behind a desk, and stare at your ink and paper all day; there
isn't much out-look there, and you won't be much wiser at the end of
the year than at the beginning. The world isn't made of pen, ink, and
paper, and if you're to get on in the world, young man, you must know
what the world's made of. Now the best chance for you `ud be to have a
place on a wharf, or in a warehouse, where you'd learn the smell of
things, but you wouldn't like that, I'll be bound; you'd have to stand
cold and wet, and be shouldered about by rough fellows. You're too
fine a gentleman for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane paused and looked hard at Tom, who certainly felt some
inward struggle before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather do what will be best for me in the end, sir; I would
put up with what was disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's well, if you can carry it out. But you must remember it isn't
only laying hold of a rope, you must go on pulling. It's the mistake
you lads make that have got nothing either in your brains or your
pocket, to think you've got a better start in the world if you stick
yourselves in a place where you can keep your coats clean, and have
the shopwenches take you for fine gentlemen. That wasn't the way _I_
started, young man; when I was sixteen, my jacket smelt of tar, and I
wasn't afraid of handling cheeses. That's the reason I can wear good
broadcloth now, and have my legs under the same table with the head
of the best firms in St. Ogg's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Deane tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) box, and seemed to expand a little under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
waistcoat and gold chain, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) squared his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulders in the chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I
should do for? I should like to set to work at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with a
slight tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit, stop a bit; we mustn't be in too great a hurry. You must
bear in mind, if I put you in a place you're a bit young for, because
you happen to be my nephew, I shall be responsible for you. And
there's no better reason, you know, than your being my nephew; because
it remains to be seen whether you're good for anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall never do you any discredit, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, hurt, as
all boys are at the statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel
no ground for trusting them. <div class="bookquote">``I care about my own credit too much for
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Tom, well done! That's the right spirit, and I never
refuse to help anybody if they've a mind to do themselves justice.
There's a young man of two-and-twenty I've got my eye on now. I shall
do what I can for that young man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got some pith in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But then,
you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s made good use of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time,--a first-rate calculator,--
can tell you the cubic contents of anything in no time, and put me up
the other day to a new market for Swedish bark; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s uncommonly
knowing in manufactures, that young fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd better set about learning book-keeping, hadn't I, uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Tom, anxious to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) readiness to exert himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, you can't do amiss there. But--Ah, Spence, you're back
again. Well Tom, there's nothing more to be said just now, I think,
and I must go to business again. Good-by. Remember me to your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) hand, with an air of friendly dismissal, and Tom
had not courage to ask another question, especially in the presence of
Mr. Spence. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>) went out again into the cold damp air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>) had to
call at his (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>) uncle Glegg's about the money in the Savings Bank, and by
the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>) set out again the mist had thickened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>) could not see
very far before him (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>); but going along River Street again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>) was
startled, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>) was within two yards of the projecting side of a
shop-window, by the words <div class="bookquote">``Dorlcote Mill''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in large letters on a
hand-bill, placed as if on purpose to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Spence</b></font>). It was the
catalogue of the sale to take place the next week; it was a reason for
hurrying faster out of the town.

<p/>Poor Tom formed no visions of the distant future as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way
homeward; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only felt that the present was very hard. It seemed a
wrong toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Deane had no confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),--did
not see at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should acquit himself well, which Tom himself
was as certain of as of the daylight. Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Tom Tulliver, was
likely to be held of small account in the world; and for the first
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) felt a sinking of heart under the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) really was
very ignorant, and could do very little. Who was that enviable young
man that could tell the cubic contents of things in no time, and make
suggestions about Swedish bark! Tom had been used to be so entirely
satisfied with himself, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breaking down in a
demonstration, and construing _nunc illas promite vires_ as <div class="bookquote">``now
promise those men'' (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly felt at a disadvantage,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew less than some one else knew. There must be a world of
things connected with that Swedish bark, which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only knew them,
might have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to get on. It would have been much easier to
make a figure with a spirited horse and a new saddle.

<p/>Two hours ago, as Tom was walking to St. Ogg's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw the distant
future before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might have seen a tempting stretch of smooth
sandy beach beyond a belt of flinty shingles; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was on the grassy
bank then, and thought the shingles might soon be passed. But now his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
feet were on the sharp stones; the belt of shingles had widened, and
the stretch of sand had dwindled into narrowness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did my Uncle Deane say, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm
through Tom's as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was warming himself rather drearily by the kitchen
fire. <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would give you a situation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't say that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't quite promise me anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
seemed to think I couldn't have a very good situation. I'm too young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) speak kindly, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kindly? Pooh! what's the use of talking about that? I wouldn't care
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) speaking kindly, if I could get a situation. But it's such a
nuisance and bother; I've been at school all this while learning Latin
and things,--not a bit of good to me,--and now my uncle says I must
set about learning book-keeping and calculation, and those things. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
seems to make out I'm good for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's mouth twitched with a bitter expression as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked at the
fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a pity we haven't got Dominie Sampson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, who
couldn't help mingling some gayety with their sadness. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had
taught me book-keeping by double entry and after the Italian method,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) did Lucy Bertram, I could teach you, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ teach! Yes, I dare say. That's always the tone you take,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Tom, I was only joking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coat-sleeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's always the same, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with the little frown he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
put on when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was about to be justifiably severe. <div class="bookquote">``You're always
setting yourself up above me and every one else, and I've wanted to
tell you about it several times. You ought not to have spoken as you
did to my uncles and aunts; you should leave it to me to take care of
my mother and you, and not put yourself forward. You think you know
better than any one, but you're almost always wrong. I can judge much
better than you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Tom! he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had just come from being lectured and made to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
inferiority; the reaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strong, self-asserting nature must
take place somehow; and here was a case in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could justly show
himself dominant. Maggie's cheek flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lip quivered with
conflicting resentment and affection, and a certain awe as well as
admiration of Tom's firmer and more effective character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not
answer immediately; very angry words rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips, but they were
driven back again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said at last:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You often think I'm conceited, Tom, when I don't mean what I say at
all in that way. I don't mean to put myself above you; I know you
behaved better than I did yesterday. But you are always so harsh to
me, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With the last words the resentment was rising again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not harsh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with severe decision. <div class="bookquote">``I'm always kind
to you, and so I shall be; I shall always take care of you. But you
must mind what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Their mother came in now, and Maggie rushed away, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) burst of
tears, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt must come, might not happen till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was safe
upstairs. They were very bitter tears; everybody in the world seemed
so hard and unkind to Maggie; there was no indulgence, no fondness,
such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagined when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fashioned the world afresh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or
tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did
not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books
was not a happy one, Maggie felt; it seemed to be a world where people
behaved the best to those they did not pretend to love, and that did
not belong to them. And if life had no love in it, what else was there
for Maggie? Nothing but poverty and the companionship of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's
narrow griefs, perhaps of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's heart-cutting childish
dependence. There is no hopelessness so sad as that of early youth,
when the soul is made up of wants, and has no long memories, no
superadded life in the life of others; though we who looked on think
lightly of such premature despair, as if our vision of the future
lightened the blind sufferer's present.

<p/>Maggie, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brown frock, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes reddened and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heavy hair
pushed back, looking from the bed where her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father lay to the dull
walls of this sad chamber which was the centre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) world, was a
creature full of eager, passionate longings for all that was beautiful
and glad; thirsty for all knowledge; with an ear straining after
dreamy music that died away and would not come near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); with a
blind, unconscious yearning for something that would link together the
wonderful impressions of this mysterious life, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soul a
sense of home in it.

<p/>No wonder, when there is this contrast between the outward and the
inward, that painful collisions come of it.



<p/>Chapter VI

<p/>Tending to Refute the Popular Prejudice against the Present of a
Pocket-Knife


<p/>In that dark time of December, the sale of the household furniture
lasted beyond the middle of the second day. Mr. Tulliver, who had
begun, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) intervals of consciousness, to manifest an irritability
which often appeared to have as a direct effect the recurrence of
spasmodic rigidity and insensibility, had lain in this living death
throughout the critical hours when the noise of the sale came nearest
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) chamber. Mr. Turnbull had decided that it would be a less risk
to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) remain where he (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) was than to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) to Luke's
cottage,--a plan which the good Luke had proposed to Mrs. Tulliver,
thinking it would be very bad if the master were <div class="bookquote">``to waken up''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>at the
noise of the sale; and the wife and children had sat imprisoned in the
silent chamber, watching the large prostrate figure on the bed, and
trembling lest the blank face should suddenly show some response to
the sounds which fell on their own ears with such obstinate, painful
repetition.

<p/>But it was over at last, that time of importunate certainty and
eye-straining suspense. The sharp sound of a voice, almost as metallic
as the rap that followed it, had ceased; the tramping of footsteps on
the gravel had died out. Mrs. Tulliver's blond face seemed aged ten
years by the last thirty hours; the poor woman's mind had been busy
divining when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) favorite things were being knocked down by the
terrible hammer; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart had been fluttering at the thought that
first one thing and then another had gone to be identified as hers in
the hateful publicity of the Golden Lion; and all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had to
sit and make no sign of this inward agitation. Such things bring lines
in well-rounded faces, and broaden the streaks of white among the
hairs that once looked as if they had been dipped in pure sunshine.
Already, at three o'clock, Kezia, the good-hearted, bad-tempered
housemaid, who regarded all people that came to the sale as her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>)
personal enemies, the dirt on whose feet was of a peculiarly vile
quality, had begun to scrub and swill with an energy much assisted by
a continual low muttering against <div class="bookquote">``folks as came to buy up other
folk's things,''  (<font color='red'><b>enemies</b></font>)</div>and made light of <div class="bookquote">``scrazing''  (<font color='red'><b>enemies</b></font>)</div>the tops of mahogany
tables over which better folks than themselves had had to--suffer a
waste of tissue through evaporation. She (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) was not scrubbing
indiscriminately, for there would be further dirt of the same
atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away their
purchases; but she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) was bent on bringing the parlor, where that
<div class="bookquote">``pipe-smoking pig,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the bailiff, had sat, to such an appearance of
scant comfort as could be given to it by cleanliness and the few
articles of furniture bought in for the family. Her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) mistress and the
young folks should have their tea in it that night, Kezia was
determined.

<p/>It was between five and six o'clock, near the usual teatime, when she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>)
came upstairs and said that Master Tom was wanted. The person who
wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was in the kitchen, and in the first moments, by the
imperfect fire and candle light, Tom had not even an indefinite sense
of any acquaintance with the rather broad-set but active figure,
perhaps two years older than himself, that looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) with a pair
of blue eyes set in a disc of freckles, and pulled some curly red
locks with a strong intention of respect. A low-crowned
oilskin-covered hat, and a certain shiny deposit of dirt on the rest
of the costume, as of tablets prepared for writing upon, suggested a
calling that had to do with boats; but this did not help Tom's memory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sarvant, Master Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) of the red locks, with a smile which
seemed to break through a self-imposed air of melancholy. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
know me again, I doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on, as Tom continued to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
inquiringly; <div class="bookquote">``but I'd like to talk to you by yourself a bit, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a fire i' the parlor, Master Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kezia</b></font>)</div>said Kezia, who objected
to leaving the kitchen in the crisis of toasting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come this way, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, wondering if this young fellow
belonged to Guest & Co.``s Wharf, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) imagination ran continually
toward that particular spot; and uncle Deane might any time be sending
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to say that there was a situation at liberty.

<p/>The bright fire in the parlor was the only light that showed the few
chairs, the bureau, the carpetless floor, and the one table--no, not
the _one_ table; there was a second table, in a corner, with a large
Bible and a few other books upon it. It was this new strange bareness
that Tom felt first, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought of looking again at the face
which was also lit up by the fire, and which stole a half-shy,
questioning glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as the entirely strange voice said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why! you don't remember Bob, then, as you gen the pocket-knife to,
Mr. Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The rough-handled pocket-knife was taken out in the same moment, and
the largest blade opened by way of irresistible demonstration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Bob Jakin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, not with any cordial delight, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt
a little ashamed of that early intimacy symbolized by the
pocket-knife, and was not at all sure that Bob's motives for recalling
it were entirely admirable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, Bob Jakin, if Jakin it must be, 'cause there's so many Bobs
as you went arter the squerrils with, that day as I plumped right down
from the bough, and bruised my shins a good un--but I got the squerril
tight for all that, an' a scratter it was. An' this littlish blade's
broke, you see, but I wouldn't hev a new un put in, 'cause they might
be cheatin' me an' givin' me another knife instid, for there isn't
such a blade i' the country,--it's got used to my hand, like. An'
there was niver nobody else gen me nothin' but what I got by my own
sharpness, only you, Mr. Tom; if it wasn't Bill Fawks as gen me the
terrier pup istid o' drowndin't it, an' I had to jaw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a good un
afore he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d give it me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob spoke with a sharp and rather treble volubility, and got through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) long speech with surprising despatch, giving the blade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
knife an affectionate rub on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sleeve when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with a slight air of patronage, the foregoing
reminscences having disposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to be as friendly as was becoming,
though there was no part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) acquaintance with Bob that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
remembered better than the cause of their parting quarrel; <div class="bookquote">``is there
anything I can do for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no, Mr. Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>answered Bob, shutting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) knife with a click
and returning it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pocket, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) seemed to be feeling for
something else. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't ha' come back upon you now ye're i'
trouble, an' folks say as the master, as I used to frighten the birds
for, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) flogged me a bit for fun when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) catched me eatin' the
turnip, as they say he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'ll niver lift up his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head no more,--I shouldn't
ha' come now to ax you to gi' me another knife 'cause you gen me one
afore. If a chap gives me one black eye, that's enough for me; I
sha'n't ax him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) for another afore I sarve him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) out; an' a good turn's
worth as much as a bad un, anyhow. I shall niver grow down`ards again,
Mr. Tom, an' you war the little chap as I liked the best when _I_ war
a little chap, for all you leathered me, and wouldn't look at me
again. There's Dick Brumby, there, I could leather him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) as much as I'd
a mind; but lors! you get tired o' leatherin' a chap when you can
niver make him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) see what you want him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) to shy at. I'n seen chaps as `ud
stand starin' at a bough till their eyes shot out, afore they'd see as
a bird's tail warn't a leaf. It's poor work goin' wi' such raff. But
you war allays a rare un at shying, Mr. Tom, an' I could trusten to
you for droppin' down wi' your stick in the nick o' time at a runnin'
rat, or a stoat, or that, when I war a-beatin' the bushes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob had drawn out a dirty canvas bag, and would perhaps not have
paused just then if Maggie had not entered the room and darted a look
of surprise and curiosity at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) red locks
again with due respect. But the next moment the sense of the altered
room came upon Maggie with a force that overpowered the thought of
Bob's presence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes had immediately glanced from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to the place
where the bookcase had hung; there was nothing now but the oblong
unfaded space on the wall, and below it the small table with the Bible
and the few other books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) burst out, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``where are the books? I
thought my uncle Glegg said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would buy them. Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? Are those
all they've left us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with a sort of desperate indifference. <div class="bookquote">``Why
should they buy many books when they bought so little furniture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes filling with tears, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
rushed up to the table to see what books had been rescued. <div class="bookquote">``Our dear
old Pilgrim's Progress that you colored with your little paints; and
that picture of Pilgrim with a mantle on, looking just like a
turtle--oh dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on, half sobbing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned over the
few books, <div class="bookquote">``I thought we should never part with that while we lived;
everything is going away from us; the end of our lives will have
nothing in it like the beginning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie turned away from the table and threw herself into a chair, with
the big tears ready to roll down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheeks, quite blinded to the
presence of Bob, who was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with the pursuant gaze of an
intelligent dumb animal, with perceptions more perfect than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
comprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, feeling that the subject of the books was
unseasonable, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you just came to see me because we're in
trouble? That was very good-natured of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you how it is, Master Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, beginning to untwist
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) canvas bag. <div class="bookquote">``You see, I'n been with a barge this two `ear; that's
how I'n been gettin' my livin',--if it wasn't when I was tentin' the
furnace, between whiles, at Torry's mill. But a fortni't ago I'd a
rare bit o' luck,--I allays thought I was a lucky chap, for I niver
set a trap but what I catched something; but this wasn't trap, it was
a fire i' Torry's mill, an' I doused it, else it `ud set th' oil
alight, an' the genelman gen me ten suvreigns; he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) gen me 'em himself
last week. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said first, I was a sperrited chap,--but I knowed
that afore,--but then he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) outs wi' the ten suvreigns, an' that war
summat new. Here they are, all but one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>Here Bob emptied the canvas
bag on the table. <div class="bookquote">``An' when I'd got 'em, my head was all of a boil
like a kettle o' broth, thinkin' what sort o' life I should take to,
for there war a many trades I'd thought on; for as for the barge, I'm
clean tired out wi`t, for it pulls the days out till they're as long
as pigs' chitterlings. An' I thought first I'd ha' ferrets an' dogs,
an' be a rat-catcher; an' then I thought as I should like a bigger way
o' life, as I didn't know so well; for I'n seen to the bottom o'
rat-catching; an' I thought, an' thought, till at last I settled I'd
be a packman,--for they're knowin' fellers, the packmen are,--an' I'd
carry the lightest things I could i' my pack; an' there'd be a use for
a feller's tongue, as is no use neither wi' rats nor barges. An' I
should go about the country far an' wide, an' come round the women wi'
my tongue, an' get my dinner hot at the public,--lors! it `ud be a
lovely life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob paused, and then said, with defiant decision, as if resolutely
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) back on that paradisaic picture:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't mind about it, not a chip! An' I'n changed one o' the
suvreigns to buy my mother a goose for dinner, an' I'n bought a blue
plush wescoat, an' a sealskin cap,--for if I meant to be a packman,
I'd do it respectable. But I don't mind about it, not a chip! My yead
isn't a turnip, an' I shall p`r`aps have a chance o' dousing another
fire afore long. I'm a lucky chap. So I'll thank you to take the nine
suvreigns, Mr. Tom, and set yoursen up with 'em somehow, if it's true
as the master's broke. They mayn't go fur enough, but they'll help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was touched keenly enough to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pride and suspicion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a very kind fellow, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, coloring, with that little
diffident tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice which gave a certain charm even to Tom's
pride and severity, <div class="bookquote">``and I sha'n't forget you again, though I didn't
know you this evening. But I can't take the nine sovereigns; I should
be taking your little fortune from you, and they wouldn't do me much
good either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't they, Mr. Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, regretfully. <div class="bookquote">``Now don't say so
'cause you think I want 'em. I aren't a poor chap. My mother gets a
good penn`orth wi' picking feathers an' things; an' if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eats
nothin' but bread-an'-water, it runs to fat. An' I'm such a lucky
chap; an' I doubt you aren't quite so lucky, Mr. Tom,--th' old master
isn't, anyhow,--an' so you might take a slice o' my luck, an' no harm
done. Lors! I found a leg o' pork i' the river one day; it had tumbled
out o' one o' them round-sterned Dutchmen, I'll be bound. Come, think
better on it, Mr. Tom, for old `quinetance' sake, else I shall think
you bear me a grudge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob pushed the sovereigns forward, but before Tom could speak Maggie,
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands, and looking penitently at Bob, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm so sorry, Bob; I never thought you were so good. Why, I think
you're the kindest person in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob had not been aware of the injurious opinion for which Maggie was
performing an inward act of penitence, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) smiled with pleasure at
this handsome eulogy,--especially from a young lass who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
informed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mother that evening, had <div class="bookquote">``such uncommon eyes, they looked
somehow as they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) feel nohow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed Bob, I can't take them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``but don't think I feel
your kindness less because I say no. I don't want to take anything
from anybody, but to work my own way. And those sovereigns wouldn't
help me much--they wouldn't really--if I were to take them. Let me
shake hands with you instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pink palm, and Bob was not slow to place his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hard,
grimy hand within it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me put the sovereigns in the bag again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``and you'll
come and see us when you've bought your pack, Bob.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like as if I'd come out o' make believe, o' purpose to show 'em
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, with an air of discontent, as Maggie gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) the bag
again, <div class="bookquote">``a-taking 'em back i' this way. I _am_ a bit of a Do, you know;
but it isn't that sort o' Do,--it's on'y when a feller's a big rogue,
or a big flat, I like to let him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) in a bit, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't you be up to any tricks, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``else you'll get
transported some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; not me, Mr. Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, with an air of cheerful
confidence. <div class="bookquote">``There's no law again' flea-bites. If I wasn't to take a
fool in now and then, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'d niver get any wiser. But, lors! hev a
suvreign to buy you and Miss summat, on'y for a token--just to match
my pocket-knife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>While Bob was speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) laid down the sovereign, and resolutely
twisted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bag again. Tom pushed back the gold, and said, <div class="bookquote">``No,
indeed, Bob; thank you heartily, but I can't take it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>And Maggie,
taking it between her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fingers, held it up to Bob and said, more
persuasively:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now, but perhaps another time. If ever Tom or my father wants
help that you can give, we'll let you know; won't we, Tom? That's what
you would like,--to have us always depend on you as a friend that we
can go to,--isn't it, Bob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss, and thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, reluctantly taking the money;
<div class="bookquote">``that's what I'd like, anything as you like. An' I wish you good-by,
Miss, and good-luck, Mr. Tom, and thank you for shaking hands wi' me,
_though_ you wouldn't take the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Kezia's entrance, with very black looks, to inquire if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shouldn't
bring in the tea now, or whether the toast was to get hardened to a
brick, was a seasonable check on Bob's flux of words, and hastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
parting bow.



<p/>Chapter VII

<p/>How a Hen Takes to Stratagem


<p/>The days passed, and Mr. Tulliver showed, at least to the eyes of the
medical man, stronger and stronger symptoms of a gradual return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
normal condition; the paralytic obstruction was, little by little,
losing its tenacity, and the mind was rising from under it with fitful
struggles, like a living creature making its way from under a great
snowdrift, that slides and slides again, and shuts up the newly made
opening.

<p/>Time would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed, if it had
only been measured by the doubtful, distant hope which kept count of
the moments within the chamber; but it was measured for them by a
fast-approaching dread which made the nights come too quickly. While
Mr. Tulliver was slowly becoming himself again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lot was hastening
toward its moment of most palpable change. The taxing-masters had done
their work like any respectable gunsmith conscientiously preparing the
musket, that, duly pointed by a brave arm, will spoil a life or two.
Allocaturs, filing of bills in Chancery, decrees of sale, are legal
chain-shot or bomb-shells that can never hit a solitary mark, but must
fall with widespread shattering. So deeply inherent is it in this life
of ours that men have to suffer for each other's sins, so inevitably
diffusive is human suffering, that even justice makes its victims, and
we can conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in
pulsations of unmerited pain.

<p/>By the beginning of the second week in January, the bills were out
advertising the sale, under a decree of Chancery, of Mr. Tulliver's
farming and other stock, to be followed by a sale of the mill and
land, held in the proper after-dinner hour at the Golden Lion. The
miller himself, unaware of the lapse of time, fancied himself still in
that first stage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) misfortunes when expedients might be thought
of; and often in his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) conscious hours talked in a feeble, disjointed
manner of plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) would carry out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``got well.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The wife and
children were not without hope of an issue that would at least save
Mr. Tulliver from leaving the old spot, and seeking an entirely
strange life. For uncle Deane had been induced to interest himself in
this stage of the business. It would not, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) acknowledged, be a bad
speculation for Guest & Co. to buy Dorlcote Mill, and carry on the
business, which was a good one, and might be increased by the addition
of steam power; in which case Tulliver might be retained as manager.
Still, Mr. Deane would say nothing decided about the matter; the fact
that Wakem held the mortgage on the land might put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) head to
bid for the whole estate, and further, to outbid the cautious firm of
Guest &Co., who did not carry on business on sentimental grounds. Mr.
Deane was obliged to tell Mrs. Tulliver something to that effect, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) rode over to the mill to inspect the books in company with Mrs.
Glegg; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had observed that <div class="bookquote">``if Guest &Co. would only think about
it, Mr. Tulliver's father and grandfather had been carrying on
Dorlcote Mill long before the oil-mill of that firm had been so much
as thought of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane, in reply, doubted whether that was precisely the relation
between the two mills which would determine their value as
investments. As for uncle Glegg, the thing lay quite beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
imagination; the good-natured man felt sincere pity for the Tulliver
family, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) money was all locked up in excellent mortgages, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
could run no risk; that would be unfair to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own relatives; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind that Tulliver should have some new flannel
waistcoats which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had himself renounced in favor of a more elastic
commodity, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would buy Mrs. Tulliver a pound of tea now and
then; it would be a journey which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) benevolence delighted in
beforehand, to carry the tea and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pleasure on being assured it
was the best black.

<p/>Still, it was clear that Mr. Deane was kindly disposed toward the
Tullivers. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had brought Lucy, who was come home for the
Christmas holidays, and the little blond angel-head had pressed itself
against Maggie's darker cheek with many kisses and some tears. These
fair slim daughters keep up a tender spot in the heart of many a
respectable partner in a respectable firm, and perhaps Lucy's anxious,
pitying questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) poor cousins helped to make uncle Deane
more prompt in finding Tom a temporary place in the warehouse, and in
putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the way of getting evening lessons in book-keeping and
calculation.

<p/>That might have cheered the lad and fed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hopes a little, if there
had not come at the same time the much-dreaded blow of finding that
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father must be a bankrupt, after all; at least, the creditors must
be asked to take less than their due, which to Tom's untechnical mind
was the same thing as bankruptcy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father must not only be said to
have <div class="bookquote">``lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) property,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>but to have <div class="bookquote">``failed,'' (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>--the word that carried
the worst obloquy to Tom's mind. For when the defendant's claim for
costs had been satisfied, there would remain the friendly bill of Mr.
Gore, and the deficiency at the bank, as well as the other debts which
would make the assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion; <div class="bookquote">``not more
than ten or twelve shillings in the pound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gore/Mr. Gore</b></font>)</div>predicted Mr. Deane, in a
decided tone, tightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) lips; and the words fell on Tom like a
scalding liquied, leaving a continual smart.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sadly in want of something to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spirits a little in
the unpleasant newness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) position,--suddenly transported from the
easy carpeted _ennui_ of study-hours at Mr. Stelling's, and the busy
idleness of castle-building in a <div class="bookquote">``last half''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stelling/Stelling</b></font>)</div>at school, to the
companionship of sacks and hides, and bawling men thundering down
heavy weights at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stelling</b></font>) elbow. The first step toward getting on in the
world was a chill, dusty, noisy affair, and implied going without
one's tea in order to stay in St. Ogg's and have an evening lesson
from a one-armed elderly clerk, in a room smelling strongly of bad
tobacco. Tom's young pink-and-white face had its colors very much
deadened by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat at home, and sat down with
keen hunger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) supper. No wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a little cross if his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
mother or Maggie spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>But all this while Mrs. Tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and no one else, would avert the result most to be dreaded, and
prevent Wakem from entertaining the purpose of bidding for the mill.
Imagine a truly respectable and amiable hen, by some portentous
anomaly, taking to reflection and inventing combinations by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
might prevail on Hodge not to wring her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) neck, or send her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
chicks to market; the result could hardly be other than much cackling
and fluttering. Mrs. Tulliver, seeing that everything had gone wrong,
had begun to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had been too passive in life; and that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
had applied her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind to business, and taken a strong resolution now
and then, it would have been all the better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) family.
Nobody, it appeared, had thought of going to speak to Wakem on this
business of the mill; and yet, Mrs. Tulliver reflected, it would have
been quite the shortest method of securing the right end. It would
have been of no use, to be sure, for Mr. Tulliver to go,--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
had been able and willing,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had been <div class="bookquote">``going to law against
Wakem''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and abusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) for the last ten years; Wakem was always likely
to have a spite against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>). And now that Mrs. Tulliver had come to
the conclusion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband was very much in the wrong to bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) into this trouble, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was inclined to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opinion of
Wakem was wrong too. To be sure, Wakem had <div class="bookquote">``put the bailies in the
house, and sold them up'' (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) did that to please the
man that lent Mr. Tulliver the money, for a lawyer had more folks to
please than one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wasn't likely to put Mr. Tulliver, who had
gone to law with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), above everybody else in the world. The attorney
might be a very reasonable man; why not? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had married a Miss Clint,
and at the time Mrs. Tulliver had heard of that marriage, the summer
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) blue satin spencer, and had not yet any thoughts of
Mr. Tulliver, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knew no harm of Wakem. And certainly toward herself,
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knew to have been a Miss Dodson, it was out of all possibility
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could entertain anything but good-will, when it was once
brought home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) observation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) part, had never
wanted to go to law, and indeed was at present disposed to take Mr.
Wakem's view of all subjects rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodson</b></font>) husband's. In fact, if
that attorney saw a respectable matron like herself disposed <div class="bookquote">``to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) good words,''  (<font color='red'><b>a matron</b></font>)</div>why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) representations? For
she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) would put the matter clearly before him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>), which had never been done
yet. And he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) would never go and bid for the mill on purpose to spite
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), an innocent woman, who thought it likely enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had
danced with him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) in their youth at Squire Darleigh's, for at those big
dances she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had often and often danced with young men whose names she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
had forgotten.

<p/>Mrs. Tulliver hid these reasonings in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own bosom; for when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
thrown out a hint to Mr. Deane and Mr. Glegg that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wouldn't mind
going to speak to Wakem herself, they had said, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Let Wakem alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in the tone of men who were not
likely to give a candid attention to a more definite exposition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
project; still less dared she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mention the plan to Tom and Maggie, for
<div class="bookquote">``the children were always so against everything their mother said'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>;
and Tom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) observed, was almost as much set against Wakem as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
father was. But this unusual concentration of thought naturally gave
Mrs. Tulliver an unusual power of device and determination: and a day
or two before the sale, to be held at the Golden Lion, when there was
no longer any time to be lost, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) carried out her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) plan by a
stratagem. There were pickles in question, a large stock of pickles
and ketchup which Mrs. Tulliver possessed, and which Mr. Hyndmarsh,
the grocer, would certainly purchase if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could transact the
business in a personal interview, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would walk with Tom to St.
Ogg's that morning; and when Tom urged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) might let the pickles
be at present,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to go about just yet,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) appeared
so hurt at this conduct in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) son, contradicting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) about pickles
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had made after the family receipts inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own
grandmother, who had died when his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother was a little girl, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
gave way, and they walked together until she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned toward Danish
Street, where Mr. Hyndmarsh retailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyndmarsh</b></font>) grocery, not far from the
offices of Mr. Wakem.

<p/>That gentleman was not yet come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) office; would Mrs. Tulliver sit
down by the fire in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) private room and wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had not
long to wait before the punctual attorney entered, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) brow
with an examining glance at the stout blond woman who rose, curtsying
deferentially,--a tallish man, with an aquiline nose and abundant
iron-gray hair. You have never seen Mr. Wakem before, and are possibly
wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was really as eminent a rascal, and as crafty,
bitter an enemy of honest humanity in general, and of Mr. Tulliver in
particular, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) is represented to be in that eidolon or portrait of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) which we have seen to exist in the miller's mind.

<p/>It is clear that the irascible miller was a man to interpret any
chance-shot that grazed him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) as an attempt on his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) own life, and was
liable to entanglements in this puzzling world, which, due
consideration had to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) own infallibility, required the hypothesis of
a very active diabolical agency to explain them. It is still possible
to believe that the attorney was not more guilty toward him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) than an
ingenious machine, which performs its work with much regularity, is
guilty toward the rash man who, venturing too near it, is caught up by
some fly-wheel or other, and suddenly converted into unexpected
mince-meat.

<p/>But it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
person; the lines and lights of the human countenance are like other
symbols,--not always easy to read without a key. On an _a priori_ view
of Wakem's aquiline nose, which offended Mr. Tulliver, there was not
more rascality than in the shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) stiff shirt-collar, though
this too along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) nose, might have become fraught with damnatory
meaning when once the rascality was ascertained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Tulliver, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wakem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray be seated. You have some business with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, beginning to feel alarmed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
own courage, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was really in presence of the formidable man, and
reflecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had not settled with herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should begin.
Mr. Wakem felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) waistcoat pockets, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) began at last,--<div class="bookquote">``I hope, sir, you're not a-thinking
as _I_ bear you any ill-will because o' my husband's losing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
lawsuit, and the bailies being put in, and the linen being sold,--oh
dear!--for I wasn't brought up in that way. I'm sure you remember my
father, sir, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was close friends with Squire Darleigh, and we
allays went to the dances there, the Miss Dodsons,--nobody could be
more looked on,--and justly, for there was four of us, and you're
quite aware as Mrs. Glegg and Mrs. Deane are my sisters. And as for
going to law and losing money, and having sales before you're dead, I
never saw anything o' that before I was married, nor for a long while
after. And I'm not to be answerable for my bad luck i' marrying out o'
my own family into one where the goings-on was different. And as for
being drawn in t' abuse you as other folks abuse you, sir, _that_ I
niver was, and nobody can say it of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head a little, and looked at the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no doubt of what you say, Mrs. Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wakem, with
cold politeness. <div class="bookquote">``But you have some question to ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, yes. But that's what I've said to myself,--I've said you'd
had some nat`ral feeling; and as for my husband, as hasn't been
himself for this two months, I'm not a-defending him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), in no way, for
being so hot about th' erigation,--not but what there's worse men, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never wronged nobody of a shilling nor a penny, not willingly; and
as for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fieriness and lawing, what could I do? And him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) struck as if
it was with death when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got the letter as said you'd the hold upo'
the land. But I can't believe but what you'll behave as a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does all this mean, Mrs. Tulliver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wakem rather
sharply. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want to ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, if you'll be so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, starting a
little, and speaking more hurriedly,--<div class="bookquote">``if you'll be so good not to buy
the mill an' the land,--the land wouldn't so much matter, only my
husband ull' be like mad at your having it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Something like a new thought flashed across Mr. Wakem's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Who told you I meant to buy it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, it's none o' my inventing, and I should never ha' thought
of it; for my husband, as ought to know about the law, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) allays used
to say as lawyers had never no call to buy anything,--either lands or
houses,--for they allays got 'em into their hands other ways. An' I
should think that `ud be the way with you, sir; and I niver said as
you'd be the man to do contrairy to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, who was it that _did_ say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
desk, and moving things about, with the accompaniment of an almost
inaudible whistle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, it was Mr. Glegg and Mr. Deane, as have all the management;
and Mr. Deane thinks as Guest &Co. `ud buy the mill and let Mr.
Tulliver work it for 'em, if you didn't bid for it and raise the
price. And it `ud be such a thing for my husband to stay where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could get his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) living: for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father's before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), the
mill was, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) grandfather built it, though I wasn't fond o' the
noise of it, when first I was married, for there was no mills in our
family,--not the Dodson's,--and if I'd known as the mills had so much
to do with the law, it wouldn't have been me as `ud have been the
first Dodson to marry one; but I went into it blindfold, that I did,
erigation and everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Guest &Co. would keep the mill in their own hands, I suppose,
and pay your husband wages?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, sir, it's hard to think of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs. Tulliver, a
little tear making its way, <div class="bookquote">``as my husband should take wage. But it
`ud look more like what used to be, to stay at the mill than to go
anywhere else; and if you'll only think--if you was to bid for the
mill and buy it, my husband might be struck worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was before,
and niver get better again as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s getting now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my
manager in the same way, how then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wakem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, I doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could niver be got to do it, not if the very mill
stood still to beg and pray of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). For your name's like poison to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), it's so as never was; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looks upon it as you've been the
ruin of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) all along, ever since you set the law on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) about the
road through the meadow,--that's eight year ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s been going
on ever since--as I've allays told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was wrong--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s a pig-headed, foul-mouthed fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div>burst out Mr. Wakem,
forgetting himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, frightened at a result so
different from the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind on; <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't wish to
contradict you, but it's like enough he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s changed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind with this
illness,--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s forgot a many things he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) used to talk about. And you
wouldn't like to have a corpse on your mind, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to die; and
they _do_ say as it's allays unlucky when Dorlcote Mill changes hands,
and the water might all run away, and _then_--not as I'm wishing you
any ill-luck, sir, for I forgot to tell you as I remember your wedding
as if it was yesterday; Mrs. Wakem was a Miss Clint, I know _that;_
and my boy, as there isn't a nicer, handsomer, straighter boy nowhere,
went to school with your son--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wakem rose, opened the door, and called to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) clerks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must excuse me for interrupting you, Mrs. Tulliver; I have
business that must be attended to; and I think there is nothing more
necessary to be said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you _would_ bear it in mind, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, rising,
<div class="bookquote">``and not run against me and my children; and I'm not denying Mr.
Tulliver's been in the wrong, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s been punished enough, and
there's worse men, for it's been giving to other folks has been his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'s done nobody any harm but himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) family,--the
more's the pity,--and I go and look at the bare shelves every day, and
think where all my things used to stand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I'll bear it in mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wakem, hastily, looking
toward the open door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you'd please not to say as I've been to speak to you, for my
son `ud be very angry with me for demeaning myself, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would,
and I've trouble enough without being scolded by my children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mrs. Tulliver's voice trembled a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could make no
answer to the attorney's <div class="bookquote">``good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>but curtsied and walked out
in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which day is it that Dorlcote Mill is to be sold? Where's the bill?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wakem to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) clerk when they were alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Next Friday is the day,--Friday at six o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, just run to Winship's the auctioneer, and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s at home. I
have some business for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); ask him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Although, when Mr. Wakem entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) office that morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had had
no intention of purchasing Dorlcote Mill, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) mind was already made
up. Mrs. Tulliver had suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) several determining motives,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) mental glance was very rapid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was one of those men who can
be prompt without being rash, because their motives run in fixed
tracks, and they have no need to reconcile conflicting aims.

<p/>To suppose that Wakem had the same sort of inveterate hatred toward
Tulliver that Tulliver had toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would be like supposing that a
pike and a roach can look at each other from a similar point of view.
The roach necessarily abhors the mode in which the pike gets his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
living, and the pike is likely to think nothing further even of the
most indignant roach than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) is excellent good eating; it could
only be when the roach choked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) that the pike could entertain a
strong personal animosity. If Mr. Tulliver had ever seriously injured
or thwarted the attorney, Wakem would not have refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) the
distinction of being a special object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) vindictiveness. But when
Mr. Tulliver called Wakem a rascal at the market dinner-table, the
attorneys' clients were not a whit inclined to withdraw their business
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>); and if, when Wakem himself happened to be present, some
jocose cattle-feeder, stimulated by opportunity and brandy, made a
thrust at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) by alluding to old ladies' wills, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) maintained perfect
_sang froid_, and knew quite well that the majority of substantial men
then present were perfectly contented with the fact that <div class="bookquote">``Wakem was
Wakem'' (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>; that is to say, a man who always knew the stepping-stones that
would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through very muddy bits of practice. A man who had
made a large fortune, had a handsome house among the trees at Tofton,
and decidedly the finest stock of port-wine in the neighborhood of St.
Ogg's, was likely to feel himself on a level with public opinion. And
I am not sure that even honest Mr. Tulliver himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) general
view of law as a cockpit, might not, under opposite circumstances,
have seen a fine appropriateness in the truth that <div class="bookquote">``Wakem was Wakem'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>;
since I have understood from persons versed in history, that mankind
is not disposed to look narrowly into the conduct of great victors
when their victory is on the right side. Tulliver, then, could be no
obstruction to Wakem; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was a poor devil whom the
lawyer had defeated several times; a hot-tempered fellow, who would
always give you a handle against him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Wakem's conscience was not
uneasy because he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had used a few tricks against the miller; why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) hate that unsuccessful plaintiff, that pitiable, furious bull
entangled in the meshes of a net?

<p/>Still, among the various excesses to which human nature is subject,
moralists have never numbered that of being too fond of the people who
openly revile us. The successful Yellow candidate for the borough of
Old Topping, perhaps, feels no pursuant meditative hatred toward the
Blue editor who consoles his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) subscribers with vituperative rhetoric
against Yellow men who sell their country, and are the demons of
private life; but he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) might not be sorry, if law and opportunity
favored, to kick that Blue editor to a deeper shade of his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) favorite
color. Prosperous men take a little vengeance now and then, as they
take a diversion, when it comes easily in their way, and is no
hindrance to business; and such small unimpassioned revenges have an
enormous effect in life, running through all degrees of pleasant
infliction, blocking the fit men out of places, and blackening
characters in unpremeditated talk. Still more, to see people who have
been only insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life and
humiliated, without any special effort of ours, is apt to have a
soothing, flattering influence. Providence or some other prince of
this world, it appears, has undertaken the task of retribution for us;
and really, by an agreeable constitution of things, our enemies
somehow _don't_ prosper.

<p/>Wakem was not without this parenthetic vindictiveness toward the
uncomplimentary miller; and now Mrs. Tulliver had put the notion into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) head, it presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) as a pleasure to do the very
thing that would cause Mr. Tulliver the most deadly mortification,--
and a pleasure of a complex kind, not made up of crude malice, but
mingling with it the relish of self-approbation. To see an enemy
humiliated gives a certain contentment, but this is jejune compared
with the highly blent satisfaction of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) humiliated by your
benevolent action or concession on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) behalf. That is a sort of
revenge which falls into the scale of virtue, and Wakem was not without
an intention of keeping that scale respectably filled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had once
had the pleasure of putting an old enemy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) into one of the St.
Ogg's alms-houses, to the rebuilding of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had given a large
subscription; and here was an opportunity of providing for another by
making him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) own servant. Such things give a completeness to
prosperity, and contribute elements of agreeable consciousness that
are not dreamed of by that short-sighted, overheated vindictiveness
which goes out its way to wreak itself in direct injury. And Tulliver,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) rough tongue filed by a sense of obligation, would make a
better servant than any chance-fellow who was cap-in-hand for a
situation. Tulliver was known to be a man of proud honesty, and Wakem
was too acute not to believe in the existence of honesty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was given
too observing individuals, not to judging of them according to maxims,
and no one knew better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) that all men were not like himself.
Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) intended to overlook the whole business of land and mill
pretty closely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was fond of these practical rural matters. But
there were good reasons for purchasing Dorlcote Mill, quite apart from
any benevolent vengeance on the miller. It was really a capital
investment; besides, Guest &Co. were going to bid for it. Mr. Guest
and Mr. Wakem were on friendly dining terms, and the attorney liked to
predominate over a ship-owner and mill-owner who was a little too loud
in the town affairs as well as in his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) table-talk. For Wakem was not a
mere man of business; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was considered a pleasant fellow in the upper
circles of St. Ogg's--chatted amusingly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) port-wine, did a
little amateur farming, and had certainly been an excellent husband
and father; at church, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went there, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat under the handsomest
of mural monuments erected to the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife. Most men would
have married again under his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) circumstances, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was said to be more
tender to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deformed son than most men were to their best-shapen
offspring. Not that Mr. Wakem had not other sons beside Philip; but
toward them he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) held only a chiaroscuro parentage, and provided for
them in a grade of life duly beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) own. In this fact, indeed,
there lay the clenching motive to the purchase of Dorlcote Mill. While
Mrs. Tulliver was talking, it had occurred to the rapid-minded lawyer,
among all the other circumstances of the case, that this purchase
would, in a few years to come, furnish a highly suitable position for
a certain favorite lad whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) meant to bring on in the world.

<p/>These were the mental conditions on which Mrs. Tulliver had undertaken
to act persuasively, and had failed; a fact which may receive some
illustration from the remark of a great philosopher, that fly-fishers
fail in preparing their bait so as to make it alluring in the right
quarter, for want of a due acquaintance with the subjectivity of
fishes.



<p/>Chapter VIII

<p/>Daylight on the Wreck


<p/>It was a clear frosty January day on which Mr. Tulliver first came
downstairs. The bright sun on the chestnut boughs and the roofs
opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) window had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) impatiently declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would be
caged up no longer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) thought everywhere would be more cheery under
this sunshine than his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) bedroom; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knew nothing of the bareness
below, which made the flood of sunshine importunate, as if it had an
unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places, and the marks where
well-known objects once had been. The impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind that it
was but yesterday when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) received the letter from Mr. Gore was so
continually implied in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) talk, and the attempts to convey to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) the
idea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had
been so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness, that even Mr.
Turnbull had begun to despair of preparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) to meet the facts by
previous knowledge. The full sense of the present could only be
imparted gradually by new experience,--not by mere words, which must
remain weaker than the impressions left by the _old_ experience. This
resolution to come downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and
children. Mrs. Tulliver said Tom must not go to St. Ogg's at the usual
hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) must wait and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) father downstairs; and Tom complied,
though with an intense inward shrinking from the painful scene. The
hearts of all three had been more deeply dejected than ever during the
last few days. For Guest & Co. had not bought the mill; both mill and
land had been knocked down to Wakem, who had been over the premises,
and had laid before Mr. Deane and Mr. Glegg, in Mrs. Tulliver's
presence, his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) willingness to employ Mr. Tulliver, in case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
recovery, as a manager of the business. This proposition had
occasioned much family debating. Uncles and aunts were almost
unanimously of opinion that such an offer ought not to be rejected
when there was nothing in the way but a feeling in Mr. Tulliver's
mind, which, as neither aunts nor uncles shared it, was regarded as
entirely unreasonable and childish,--indeed, as a transferring toward
Wakem of that indignation and hatred which Mr. Tulliver ought properly
to have directed against himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) general quarrelsomeness, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) special exhibition of it in going to law. Here was an opportunity
for Mr. Tulliver to provide for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife and daughter without any
assistance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife's relations, and without that too evident
descent into pauperism which makes it annoying to respectable people
to meet the degraded member of the family by the wayside. Mr.
Tulliver, Mrs. Glegg considered, must be made to feel, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) came to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) right mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could never humble himself enough; for _that_
had come which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had always foreseen would come of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) insolence in
time past <div class="bookquote">``to them as were the best friends he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'d got to look to.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr
Glegg and Mr. Deane were less stern in their views, but they both of
them thought Tulliver had done enough harm by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) hot-tempered
crotchets and ought to put them out of the question when a livelihood
was offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>); Wakem showed a right feeling about the matter,--_he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)_
had no grudge against Tulliver.

<p/>Tom had protested against entertaining the proposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shouldn't
like his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father to be under Wakem; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) thought it would look
mean-spirited; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) mother's main distress was the utter
impossibility of ever <div class="bookquote">``turning Mr. Tulliver round about Wakem,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>or
getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) to hear reason; no, they would all have to go and live in
a pigsty on purpose to spite Wakem, who spoke <div class="bookquote">``so as nobody could be
fairer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>Indeed, Mrs. Tulliver's mind was reduced to such confusion by
living in this strange medium of unaccountable sorrow, against which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) continually appealed by asking, <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, what _have_ I done to
deserve worse than other women?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that Maggie began to suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) poor
mother's wits were quite going.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, when they were out of their father's room together,
<div class="bookquote">``we _must_ try to make father understand a little of what has happened
before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goes downstairs. But we must get my mother away. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will
say something that will do harm. Ask Kezia to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) down, and keep
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) engaged with something in the kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Kezia was equal to the task. Having declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) intention of staying
till the master could get about again, <div class="bookquote">``wage or no wage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
found a certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mistress,
scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for <div class="bookquote">``moithering''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>herself, and going about all day without
changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cap, and looking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``mushed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Altogether, this
time of trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could
scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) betters with unreproved freedom. On this particular occasion
there were drying clothes to be fetched in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wished to know if one
pair of hands could do everything in-doors and out, and observed that
_she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ should have thought it would be good for Mrs. Tulliver to put on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) bonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece
of work. Poor Mrs. Tulliver went submissively downstairs; to be
ordered about by a servant was the last remnant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) household
dignities,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would soon have no servant to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). Mr. Tulliver
was resting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) chair a little after the fatigue of dressing, and
Maggie and Tom were seated near him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), when Luke entered to ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
should help master downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, Luke; stop a bit, sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
stick toward a chair, and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) with that pursuant gaze which
convalescent persons often have for those who have tended them,
reminding one of an infant gazing about after its nurse. For Luke had
been a constant night-watcher by his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) master's bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's the water now, eh, Luke?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``Dix hasn't been
choking you up again, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, it's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, I thought not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dix</b></font>) won't be in a hurry at that again, now Riley's
been to settle him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>). That was what I said to Riley yesterday--I
said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver leaned forward, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) elbows on the armchair, and
looking on the ground as if in search of something, striving after
vanishing images like a man struggling against a doze. Maggie looked
at Tom in mute distress, their father's mind was so far off the
present, which would by-and-by thrust itself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wandering
consciousness! Tom was almost ready to rush away, with that impatience
of painful emotion which makes one of the differences between youth
and maiden, man and woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``don't you remember
that Mr. Riley is dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, sharply, looking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face with a
strange, examining glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) died of apoplexy nearly a year ago. I remember hearing you
say you had to pay money for him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) daughters badly off;
one of them is under-teacher at Miss Firniss's, where I've been to
school, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, doubtfully, still looking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face. But as
soon as Tom began to speak he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned to look at _him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)_ with the same
inquiring glances, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were rather surprised at the presence of
these two young people. Whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind was wandering in the far
past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fell into this oblivion of their actual faces; they were not
those of the lad and the little wench who belonged to that past.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a long while since you had the dispute with Dix, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said
Tom. <div class="bookquote">``I remember your talking about it three years ago, before I went
to school at Mr. Stelling's. I've been at school there three years;
don't you remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver threw himself backward again, losing the childlike
outward glance under a rush of new ideas, which diverted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) from
external impressions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, after a minute or two, <div class="bookquote">``I've paid a deal o'
money--I was determined my son should have a good eddication; I'd none
myself, and I've felt the miss of it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'ll want no other fortin,
that's what I say--if Wakem was to get the better of me again--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The thought of Wakem roused new vibrations, and after a moment's pause
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) began to look at the coat he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had on, and to feel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
side-pocket. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) turned to Tom, and said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old sharp way,
<div class="bookquote">``Where have they put Gore's letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was close at hand in a drawer, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had often asked for it
before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what there is in the letter, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gave
it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, rather angrily. <div class="bookquote">``What o' that?
If Furley can't take to the property, somebody else can; there's
plenty o' people in the world besides Furley. But it's hindering--my
not being well--go and tell 'em to get the horse in the gig, Luke; I
can get down to St. Ogg's well enough--Gore's expecting me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie burst out entreatingly; <div class="bookquote">``it's a very long
while since all that; you've been ill a great many weeks,--more than
two months; everything is changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled
gaze; the idea that much had happened of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knew nothing had
often transiently arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) before, but it came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) now with
entire novelty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in answer to the gaze. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't trouble
your mind about business until you are quite well; everything is
settled about that for the present,--about the mill and the land and
the debts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's settled, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you take on too much bout it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke. <div class="bookquote">``You'd ha' paid
iverybody if you could,--that's what I said to Master Tom,--I said
you'd ha' paid iverybody if you could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>Good Luke felt, after the manner of contented hard-working men whose
lives have been spent in servitude, that sense of natural fitness in
rank which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) master's downfall a tragedy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was urged,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) slow way, to say something that would express his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) share in the
family sorrow; and these words, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had used over and over again
to Tom when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to decline the full payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fifty pounds
out of the children's money, were the most ready to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tongue. They
were just the words to lay the most painful hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master's
bewildered mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paid everybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, with vehement agitation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face flushing,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye lighting up. <div class="bookquote">``Why--what--have they made me a _bankrupt?_''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, dear father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, who thought that terrible word
really represented the fact; <div class="bookquote">``bear it well, because we love you; your
children will always love you. Tom will pay them all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father beginning to tremble; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice trembled too, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, after a few moments:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, my little wench, but I shall never live twice o'er.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom,
speaking with a great effort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head slowly, <div class="bookquote">``but what's
broke can never be whole again; it `ud be your doing, not mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Then
looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You're only sixteen; it's an up-hill fight for
you, but you mustn't throw it at your father; the raskills have been
too many for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I've given you a good eddication,--that'll start
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) throat half choked the last words; the flush, which
had alarmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) children because it had so often preceded a recurrence
of paralysis, had subsided, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) face looked pale and tremulous.
Tom said nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was still struggling against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inclination to
rush away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father remained quiet a minute or two, but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind did
not seem to be wandering again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have they sold me up, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said more calmly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were
possessed simply by the desire to know what had happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is sold, father; but we don't know all about the mill and
the land yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, anxious to ward off any question leading to
the fact that Wakem was the purchaser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs,
father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``but there's your chair and the bureau;
_they're_ not gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go; help me down, Luke,--I'll go and see everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Tulliver, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) stick, and stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) other hand
toward Luke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``you'll make
up your mind to't a bit better when you've seen iverything; you'll get
used to`t. That's what my mother says about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shortness o'
breath,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s made friends wi't now, though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fought
again' it sore when it just come on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie ran on before to see that all was right in the dreary parlor,
where the fire, dulled by the frosty sunshine, seemed part of the
general shabbiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's chair, and pushed aside
the table to make an easy way for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and then stood with a beating
heart to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) enter and look round for the first time. Tom advanced
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), carrying the leg-rest, and stood beside Maggie on the
hearth. Of those two young hearts Tom's suffered the most unmixed
pain, for Maggie, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) keen susceptibility, yet felt as if the
sorrow made larger room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) love to flow in, and gave
breathing-space to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) passionate nature. No true boy feels that; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
would rather go and slay the Nemean lion, or perform any round of
heroic labors, than endure perpetual appeals to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pity, for evils
over which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can make no conquest.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver paused just inside the door, resting on Luke, and looking
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) at all the bare places, which for him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) were filled with the
shadows of departed objects,--the daily companions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
faculties seemed to be renewing their strength from getting a footing
on this demonstration of the senses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said slowly, moving toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``they've sold me
up--they've sold me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then seating himself, and laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) stick, while Luke left the
room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) looked round again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They've left the big Bible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's got everything in,--when
I was born and married; bring it me, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The quarto Bible was laid open before him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) at the fly-leaf, and while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was reading with slowly travelling eyes Mrs. Tulliver entered the
room, but stood in mute surprise to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband down already, and
with the great Bible before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, looking at a spot where his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) finger rested, <div class="bookquote">``my mother
was Margaret Beaton; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) died when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was forty-seven,--hers wasn't a
long-lived family; we're our mother's children, Gritty and me are,--we
shall go to our last bed before long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed to be pausing over the record of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister's birth and
marriage, as if it were suggesting new thoughts to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
suddenly looked up at Tom, and said, in a sharp tone of alarm:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They haven't come upo' Moss for the money as I lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Beaton</b></font>), have they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``the note was burnt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes on the page again, and presently said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--Elizabeth Dodson--it's eighteen year since I married her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come next Ladyday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, going up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) side and
looking at the page.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes earnestly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you was a pretty lass then,--everybody said
so,--and I used to think you kept your good looks rarely. But you're
sorely aged; don't you bear me ill-will--I meant to do well by you--we
promised one another for better or for worse--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I never thought it `ud be so for worse as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs.
Tulliver, with the strange, scared look that had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) of
late; <div class="bookquote">``and my poor father gave me away--and to come on so all at
once--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``don't talk in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I know you won't let your poor mother speak--that's been the way
all my life--your father never minded what I said--it `ud have been o'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say so, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, whose pride, in these first
moments of humiliation, was in abeyance to the sense of some justice
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife's reproach. <div class="bookquote">``It there's anything left as I could do to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we might stay here and get a living, and I might keep among my

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, severely, <div class="bookquote">``this is not the time to talk about

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``Say what you mean, Bessy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, now the mill and the land's all Wakem's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s got everything

says you may stay here, and speaks as fair as can be, and says you may
manage the business, and have thirty shillings a-week, and a horse to
ride about to market? And where have we got to put our heads? We must
go into one o' the cottages in the village,--and me and my children
brought down to that,--and all because you must set your mind against
folks till there's no turning you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver had sunk back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) chair trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may do as you like wi' me, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, in a low voice; <div class="bookquote">``I've

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I don't agree with my mother or my uncles, and I

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter IX

<p/>An Item Added to the Family Register


<p/>That first moment of renunciation and submission was followed by days
of violent struggle in the miller's mind, as the gradual access of
bodily strength brought with it increasing ability to embrace in one
view all the conflicting conditions under which he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) found himself.
Feeble limbs easily resign themselves to be tethered, and when we are
subdued by sickness it seems possible to us to fulfil pledges which
the old vigor comes back and breaks. There were times when poor
Tulliver thought the fulfilment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) promise to Bessy was something
quite too hard for human nature; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessy</b></font>) without knowing
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessy</b></font>) was going to say,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessy</b></font>) might as well have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to carry
a ton weight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) back. But again, there were many feelings arguing
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessy</b></font>) side, besides the sense that life had been made hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessy</b></font>) by
having married him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) saw a possibility, by much pinching, of saving
money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) salary toward paying a second dividend to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
creditors, and it would not be easy elsewhere to get a situation such
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could fill.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had led an easy life, ordering much and working little, and had no
aptitude for any new business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) must perhaps take to day-labor, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife must have help from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sisters,--a prospect doubly bitter to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), now they had let all Bessy's precious things be sold, probably
because they liked to set her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), by making her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to that pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) listened to their admonitory talk,
when they came to urge on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was bound to do for poor Bessy's
sake, with averted eyes, that every now and then flashed on them
furtively when their backs were turned. Nothing but the dread of
needing their help could have made it an easier alternative to take
their advice.

<p/>But the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had run about when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was a boy, just as Tom had done after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). The Tullivers had lived on this spot for generations, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
sat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father
talked of the old half-timbered mill that had been there before the
last great floods which damaged it so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grandfather pulled it
down and built the new one. It was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got able to walk about and
look at all the old objects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt the strain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clinging
affection for the old home as part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, part of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
couldn't bear to think of himself living on any other spot than this,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew the sound of every gate door, and felt that the shape
and color of every roof and weather-stain and broken hillock was good,
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) growing senses had been fed on them. Our instructed
vagrancy, which was hardly time to linger by the hedgerows, but runs
away early to the tropics, and is at home with palms and
banyans,--which is nourished on books of travel and stretches the
theatre of its imagination to the Zambesi,--can hardly get a dim
notion of what an old-fashioned man like Tulliver felt for this spot,
where all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) memories centred, and where life seemed like a familiar
smooth-handled tool that the fingers clutch with loving ease. And just
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was living in that freshened memory of the far-off time which
comes to us in the passive hours of recovery from sickness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said one afternoon, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) stood looking over the
orchard gate, <div class="bookquote">``I remember the day they planted those apple-trees. My
father was a huge man for planting,--it was like a merry-making to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
to get a cart full o' young trees; and I used to stand i' the cold
with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and follow him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) about like a dog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) turned round, and leaning against the gate-post, looked at the
opposite buildings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old mill `ud miss me, I think, Luke. There's a story as when the
mill changes hands, the river's angry; I've heard my father say it
many a time. There's no telling whether there mayn't be summat _in_
the story, for this is a puzzling world, and Old Harry's got a finger
in it--it's been too many for me, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, with soothing sympathy, <div class="bookquote">``what wi' the rust on
the wheat, an' the firin' o' the ricks an' that, as I've seen i' my
time,--things often looks comical; there's the bacon fat wi' our last
pig run away like butter,--it leaves nought but a scratchin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just as if it was yesterday, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tulliver went on, <div class="bookquote">``when
my father began the malting. I remember, the day they finished the
malt-house, I thought summat great was to come of it; for we'd a
plum-pudding that day and a bit of a feast, and I said to my
mother,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a fine dark-eyed woman, my mother was,--the little
wench `ull be as like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as two peas.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Here Mr. Tulliver put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
stick between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) legs, and took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) snuff-box, for the greater
enjoyment of this anecdote, which dropped from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) in fragments, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) every other moment lost narration in vision. ``I was a little chap
no higher much than my mother's knee,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sore fond of us
children, Gritty and me,--and so I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), ``Mother,<div class="bookquote">'' I said,
`shall we have plum-pudding _every_ day because o' the malt-house? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
used to tell me o' that till her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) dying day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was but a young woman
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) died, my mother was. But it's forty good year since they
finished the malt-house, and it isn't many days out of 'em all as I
haven't looked out into the yard there, the first thing in the
morning,--all weathers, from year's end to year's end. I should go off
my head in a new place. I should be like as if I'd lost my way. It's
all hard, whichever way I look at it,--the harness `ull gall me, but
it `ud be summat to draw along the old road, instead of a new un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``you'd be a deal better here nor in some new
place. I can't abide new places mysen: things is allays
awk`ard,--narrow-wheeled waggins, belike, and the stiles all another
sort, an' oat-cake i' some places, tow`rt th' head o' the Floss,
there. It's poor work, changing your country-side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I doubt, Luke, they'll be for getting rid o' Ben, and making you
do with a lad; and I must help a bit wi' the mill. You'll have a worse
place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ne'er mind, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``I sha'n't plague mysen. I'n been wi'
you twenty year, an' you can't get twenty year wi' whistlin' for 'em,
no more nor you can make the trees grow: you mun wait till God
A'mighty sends 'em. I can't abide new victual nor new faces, _I_
can't,--you niver know but what they'll gripe you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>The walk was finished in silence after this, for Luke had disburthened
himself of thoughts to an extent that left his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) conversational
resources quite barren, and Mr. Tulliver had relapsed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
recollections into a painful meditation on the choice of hardships
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). Maggie noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was unusually absent that evening
at tea; and afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sat leaning forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) chair, looking at
the ground, moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lips, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head from time to time.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked hard at Mrs. Tulliver, who was knitting opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>),
then at Maggie, who, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sewing, was intensely
conscious of some drama going forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's mind. Suddenly
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took up the poker and broke the large coal fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart, Mr. Tulliver, what can you be thinking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wife, looking up in alarm; <div class="bookquote">``it's very wasteful, breaking the coal, and
we've got hardly any large coal left, and I don't know where the rest
is to come from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you're quite so well to-night, are you, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said
Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``you seem uneasy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how is it Tom doesn't come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart, is it time? I must go and get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) supper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver, laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knitting, and leaving the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nigh upon half-past eight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll be here
soon. Go, go and get the big Bible, and open it at the beginning,
where everything's set down. And get the pen and ink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie obeyed, wondering; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father gave no further orders, and
only sat listening for Tom's footfall on the gravel, apparently
irritated by the wind, which had risen, and was roaring so as to drown
all other sounds. There was a strange light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes that rather
frightened Maggie; _she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ began to wish that Tom would come, too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, in an excited way, when the
knock came at last. Maggie went to open the door, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother came
out of the kitchen hurriedly, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit, Maggie; I'll open
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tulliver had begun to be a little frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) boy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
was jealous of every office others did for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your supper's ready by the kitchen-fire, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
took off his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat and coat. <div class="bookquote">``You shall have it by yourself, just as you
like, and I won't speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think my father wants Tom, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must come into
the parlor first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom entered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) usual saddened evening face, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes fell
immediately on the open Bible and the inkstand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glanced with a
look of anxious surprise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, who was saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, you're late; I want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything the matter, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sit down, all of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, peremptorily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Tom, sit down here; I've got something for you to write i' the
Bible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They all three sat down, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) began to speak slowly,
looking first at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've made up my mind, Bessy, and I'll be as good as my word to you.
There'll be the same grave made for us to lie down in, and we mustn't
be bearing one another ill-will. I'll stop in the old place, and I'll
serve under Wakem, and I'll serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) like an honest man; there's no
Tulliver but what's honest, mind that, Tom,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--here his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) voice
rose,--<div class="bookquote">``they'll have it to throw up against me as I paid a dividend,
but it wasn't my fault; it was because there's raskills in the world.
They've been too many for me, and I must give in. I'll put my neck in
harness,--for you've a right to say as I've brought you into trouble,
Bessy,--and I'll serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as honest as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was no raskill; I'm an
honest man, though I shall never hold my head up no more. I'm a tree
as is broke--a tree as is broke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) paused and looked on the ground. Then suddenly raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
said, in a louder yet deeper tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I won't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)! I know what they say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never meant me any
harm. That's the way Old Harry props up the rascals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s been at the
bottom of everything; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s a fine gentleman,--I know, I know. I
shouldn't ha' gone to law, they say. But who made it so as there was
no arbitratin', and no justice to be got? It signifies nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
I know that; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s one o' them fine gentlemen as get money by doing
business for poorer folks, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s made beggars of 'em he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll
give 'em charity. I won't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)! I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might be punished
with shame till his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own son `ud like to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may do
summat as they'd make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) work at the treadmill! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) won't,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s
too big a raskill to let the law lay hold on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). And you mind this,
Tom,--you never forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neither, if you mean to be my son.
There'll maybe come a time when you may make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feel; it'll never
come to me; I'n got my head under the yoke. Now write--write it i' the
Bible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, sinking down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) knee, pale and
trembling. <div class="bookquote">``It's wicked to curse and bear malice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't wicked, I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``It's wicked
as the raskills should prosper; it's the Devil's doing. Do as I tell
you, Tom. Write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to write?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with gloomy submission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Write as your father, Edward Tulliver, took service under John Wakem,
the man as had helped to ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), because I'd promised my wife to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) what amends I could for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) trouble, and because I wanted to
die in th' old place where I was born and my father was born. Put that
i' the right words--you know how--and then write, as I don't forgive
Wakem for all that; and for all I'll serve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) honest, I wish evil may
befall him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Write that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a dead silence as Tom's pen moved along the paper; Mrs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let me hear what you've wrote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, Tom read aloud
slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now write--write as you'll remember what Wakem's done to your father,

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Book IV

<p/>_The Valley of Humiliation_



<p/>Chapter I

<p/>A Variation of Protestantism Unknown to Bossuet


<p/>Journeying down the Rhone on a summer's day, you have perhaps felt the
sunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in
certain parts of its course, telling how the swift river once rose,
like an angry, destroying god, sweeping down the feeble generations
whose breath is in their nostrils, and making their dwellings a
desolation. Strange contrast, you may have thought, between the
effect produced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace
houses, which in their best days were but the sign of a sordid life,
belonging in all its details to our own vulgar era, and the effect
produced by those ruins on the castled Rhine, which have crumbled and
mellowed into such harmony with the green and rocky steeps that they
seem to have a natural fitness, like the mountain-pine; nay, even in
the day when they were built they must have had this fitness, as if
they had been raised by an earth-born race, who had inherited from
their mighty parent a sublime instinct of form. And that was a day of
romance; If those robber-barons were somewhat grim and drunken ogres,
they had a certain grandeur of the wild beast in them,--they were
forest boars with tusks, tearing and rending, not the ordinary
domestic grunter; they represented the demon forces forever in
collision with beauty, virtue, and the gentle uses of life; they made
a fine contrast in the picture with the wandering minstrel, the
soft-lipped princess, the pious recluse, and the timid Israelite. That
was a time of color, when the sunlight fell on glancing steel and
floating banners; a time of adventure and fierce struggle,--nay, of
living, religious art and religious enthusiasm; for were not
cathedrals built in those days, and did not great emperors leave their
Western palaces to die before the infidel strongholds in the sacred
East? Therefore it is that these Rhine castles thrill me with a sense
of poetry; they belong to the grand historic life of humanity, and
raise up for me the vision of an echo. But these dead-tinted,
hollow-eyed, angular skeletons of villages on the Rhone oppress me
with the feeling that human life--very much of it--is a narrow, ugly,
grovelling existence, which even calamity does not elevate, but rather
tends to exhibit in all its bare vulgarity of conception; and I have a
cruel conviction that the lives these ruins are the traces of were
part of a gross sum of obscure vitality, that will be swept into the
same oblivion with the generations of ants and beavers.

<p/>Perhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed
upon you in watching this old-fashioned family life on the banks of
the Floss, which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level
of the tragi-comic. It is a sordid life, you say, this of the
Tullivers and Dodsons, irradiated by no sublime principles, no
romantic visions, no active, self-renouncing faith; moved by none of
those wild, uncontrollable passions which create the dark shadows of
misery and crime; without that primitive, rough simplicity of wants,
that hard, submissive, ill-paid toil, that childlike spelling-out of
what nature has written, which gives its poetry to peasant life. Here
one has conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction
and without polish, surely the most prosaic form of human life; proud
respectability in a gig of unfashionable build; worldliness without
side-dishes. Observing these people narrowly, even when the iron hand
of misfortune has shaken them from their unquestioning hold on the
world, one sees little trace of religion, still less of a
distinctively Christian creed. Their belief in the Unseen, so far as
it manifests itself at all, seems to be rather a pagan kind; their
moral notions, though held with strong tenacity, seem to have no
standard beyond hereditary custom. You could not live among such
people; you are stifled for want of an outlet toward something
beautiful, great, or noble; you are irritated with these dull men and
women, as a kind of population out of keeping with the earth on which
they live,--with this rich plain where the great river flows forever
onward, and links the small pulse of the old English town with the
beatings of the world's mighty heart. A vigorous superstition, that
lashes its gods or lashes its own back, seems to be more congruous
with the mystery of the human lot, than the mental condition of these
emmet-like Dodsons and Tullivers.

<p/>I share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness; but it is
necessary that we should feel it, if we care to understand how it
acted on the lives of Tom and Maggie,--how it has acted on young
natures in many generations, that in the onward tendency of human
things have risen above the mental level of the generation before
them, to which they have been nevertheless tied by the strongest
fibres of their hearts. The suffering, whether of martyr or victim,
which belongs to every historical advance of mankind, is represented
in this way in every town, and by hundreds of obscure hearths; and we
need not shrink from this comparison of small things with great; for
does not science tell us that its highest striving is after the
ascertainment of a unity which shall bind the smallest things with the
greatest? In natural science, I have understood, there is nothing
petty to the mind that has a large vision of relations, and to which
every single object suggests a vast sum of conditions. It is surely
the same with the observation of human life.

<p/>Certainly the religious and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers
were of too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively, from the
statement that they were part of the Protestant population of Great
Britain. Their theory of life had its core of soundness, as all
theories must have on which decent and prosperous families have been
reared and have flourished; but it had the very slightest tincture of
theology. If, in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters, their Bibles
opened more easily at some parts than others, it was because of dried
tulip-petals, which had been distributed quite impartially, without
preference for the historical, devotional, or doctrinal. Their
religion was of a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in
it,--if heresy properly means choice,--for they didn't know there was
any other religion, except that of chapel-goers, which appeared to run
in families, like asthma. How _should_ they know? The vicar of their
pleasant rural parish was not a controversialist, but a good hand at
whist, and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female
parishioner. The religion of the Dodsons consisted in revering
whatever was customary and respectable; it was necessary to be
baptized, else one could not be buried in the church-yard, and to take
the sacrament before death, as a security against more dimly
understood perils; but it was of equal necessity to have the proper
pall-bearers and well-cured hams at one's funeral, and to leave an
unimpeachable will. A Dodson would not be taxed with the omission of
anything that was becoming, or that belonged to that eternal fitness
of things which was plainly indicated in the practice of the most
substantial parishioners, and in the family traditions,--such as
obedience to parents, faithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid
honesty, thrift, the thorough scouring of wooden and copper utensils,
the hoarding of coins likely to disappear from the currency, the
production of first-rate commodities for the market, and the general
preference of whatever was home-made. The Dodsons were a very proud
race, and their pride lay in the utter frustration of all desire to
tax them with a breach of traditional duty or propriety. A wholesome
pride in many respects, since it identified honor with perfect
integrity, thoroughness of work, and faithfulness to admitted rules;
and society owes some worthy qualities in many of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) members to
mothers of the Dodson class, who made their butter and their fromenty
well, and would have felt disgraced to make it otherwise. To be honest
and poor was never a Dodson motto, still less to seem rich though
being poor; rather, the family badge was to be honest and rich, and
not only rich, but richer than was supposed. To live respected, and
have the proper bearers at your funeral, was an achievement of the
ends of existence that would be entirely nullified if, on the reading
of your will, you sank in the opinion of your fellow-men, either by
turning out to be poorer than they expected, or by leaving your money
in a capricious manner, without strict regard to degrees of kin. The
right thing must always be done toward kindred. The right thing was to
correct them severely, if they were other than a credit to the family,
but still not to alienate from them the smallest rightful share in the
family shoebuckles and other property. A conspicuous quality in the
Dodson character was its genuineness; its vices and virtues alike were
phases of a proud honest egoism, which had a hearty dislike to
whatever made against its own credit and interest, and would be
frankly hard of speech to inconvenient <div class="bookquote">``kin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodson character</b></font>)</div>but would never forsake
or ignore them,--would not let them want bread, but only require them
to eat it with bitter herbs.

<p/>The same sort of traditional belief ran in the Tulliver veins, but it
was carried in richer blood, having elements of generous imprudence,
warm affection, and hot-tempered rashness. Mr. Tulliver's grandfather
had been heard to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was descended from one Ralph Tulliver, a
wonderfully clever fellow, who had ruined himself. It is likely enough
that the clever Ralph was a high liver, rode spirited horses, and was
very decidedly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) own opinion. On the other hand, nobody had ever
heard of a Dodson who had ruined himself; it was not the way of that
family.

<p/>If such were the views of life on which the Dodsons and Tullivers had
been reared in the praiseworthy past of Pitt and high prices, you will
infer from what you already know concerning the state of society in
St. Ogg's, that there had been no highly modifying influence to act on
them in their maturer life. It was still possible, even in that later
time of anti-Catholic preaching, for people to hold many pagan ideas,
and believe themselves good church-people, notwithstanding; so we need
hardly feel any surprise at the fact that Mr. Tulliver, though a
regular church-goer, recorded his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) vindictiveness on the fly-leaf of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) Bible. It was not that any harm could be said concerning the vicar
of that charming rural parish to which Dorlcote Mill belonged; he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) was
a man of excellent family, an irreproachable bachelor, of elegant
pursuits,--had taken honors, and held a fellowship. Mr. Tulliver
regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) with dutiful respect, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) did everything else belonging
to the church-service; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) considered that church was one thing and
common-sense another, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wanted nobody to tell _him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)_ what
commonsense was. Certain seeds which are required to find a nidus for
themselves under unfavorable circumstances have been supplied by
nature with an apparatus of hooks, so that they will get a hold on
very unreceptive surfaces. The spiritual seed which had been scattered
over Mr. Tulliver had apparently been destitute of any corresponding
provision, and had slipped off to the winds again, from a total
absence of hooks.



<p/>Chapter II

<p/>The Torn Nest Is Pierced by the Thorns


<p/>There is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies
the first shocks of trouble, just as an acute pain is often a
stimulus, and produces an excitement which is transient strength. It
is in the slow, changed life that follows; in the time when sorrow has
become stale, and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts
its pain; in the time when day follows day in dull, unexpectant
sameness, and trial is a dreary routine,--it is then that despair
threatens; it is then that the peremptory hunger of the soul is felt,
and eye and ear are strained after some unlearned secret of our
existence, which shall give to endurance the nature of satisfaction.

<p/>This time of utmost need was come to Maggie, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) short span of
thirteen years. To the usual precocity of the girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added that
early experience of struggle, of conflict between the inward impulse
and outward fact, which is the lot of every imaginative and passionate
nature; and the years since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hammered the nails into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wooden
Fetish among the worm-eaten shelves of the attic had been filled with
so eager a life in the triple world of Reality, Books, and Waking
Dreams, that Maggie was strangely old for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) years in everything
except in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) entire want of that prudence and self-command which were
the qualities that made Tom manly in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) intellectual
boyishness. And now her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lot was beginning to have a still, sad
monotony, which threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more than ever on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inward self. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father was able to attend to business again, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) affairs were settled,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was acting as Wakem's manager on the old spot. Tom went to and
fro every morning and evening, and became more and more silent in the
short intervals at home; what was there to say? One day was like
another; and Tom's interest in life, driven back and crushed on every
other side, was concentrating itself into the one channel of ambitious
resistance to misfortune. The peculiarities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father and mother
were very irksome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), now they were laid bare of all the softening
accompaniments of an easy, prosperous home; for Tom had very clear,
prosaic eyes, not apt to be dimmed by mists of feeling or imagination.
Poor Mrs. Tulliver, it seemed, would never recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) old self, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
placid household activity; how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)? The objects among which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
mind had moved complacently were all gone,--all the little hopes and
schemes and speculations, all the pleasant little cares about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
treasures which had made the world quite comprehensible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) for a
quarter of a century, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) first purchase of the
sugar-tongs, had been suddenly snatched away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
remained bewildered in this empty life. Why that should have happened
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) which had not happened to other women remained an insoluble
question by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) perpetual ruminating comparison of
the past with the present. It was piteous to see the comely woman
getting thinner and more worn under a bodily as well as mental
restlessness, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) often wander about the empty house after
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work was done, until Maggie, becoming alarmed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), would
seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) down by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) how it vexed Tom that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was injuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) health by never sitting down and resting herself. Yet
amidst this helpless imbecility there was a touching trait of humble,
self-devoting maternity, which made Maggie feel tenderly toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
poor mother amidst all the little wearing griefs caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mental
feebleness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would let Maggie do none of the work that was heaviest
and most soiling to the hands, and was quite peevish when Maggie
attempted to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) grate-brushing and scouring: <div class="bookquote">``Let it
alone, my dear; your hands `ull get as hard as hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would say;
<div class="bookquote">``it's your mother's place to do that. I can't do the sewing--my eyes
fail me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would still brush and carefully tend Maggie's hair,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had become reconciled to, in spite of its refusal to curl,
now it was so long and massy. Maggie was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pet child, and, in
general, would have been much better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been quite different;
yet the womanly heart, so bruised in its small personal desires, found
a future to rest on in the life of this young thing, and the mother
pleased herself with wearing out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own hands to save the hands that
had so much more life in them.

<p/>But the constant presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's regretful bewilderment was
less painful to Maggie than that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's sullen,
incommunicative depression. As long as the paralysis was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and
it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might always be in a childlike condition of
dependence,--as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was still only half awakened to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
trouble,--Maggie had felt the strong tide of pitying love almost as an
inspiration, a new power, that would make the most difficult life easy
for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake; but now, instead of childlike dependence, there had come
a taciturn, hard concentration of purpose, in strange contrast with
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old vehement communicativeness and high spirit; and this lasted
from day to day, and from week to week, the dull eye never brightening
with any eagerness or any joy. It is something cruelly incomprehensible
to youthful natures, this sombre sameness in middle-aged and elderly
people, whose life has resulted in disappointment and discontent, to
whose faces a smile becomes so strange that the sad lines all about
the lips and brow seem to take no notice of it, and it hurries away
again for want of a welcome. <div class="bookquote">``Why will they not kindle up and be
glad sometimes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thinks young elasticity. <div class="bookquote">``It would be so easy if they
only liked to do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And these leaden clouds that never part are apt
to create impatience even in the filial affection that streams forth in
nothing but tenderness and pity in the time of more obvious affliction.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver lingered nowhere away from home; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) hurried away from
market, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) refused all invitations to stay and chat, as in old times,
in the houses where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) called on business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could not be reconciled
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) lot. There was no attitude in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) pride did not feel
its bruises; and in all behavior toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), whether kind or cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
detected an allusion to the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) circumstances. Even the days
on which Wakem came to ride round the land and inquire into the
business were not so black to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) as those market-days on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had
met several creditors who had accepted a composition from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>). To save
something toward the repayment of those creditors was the object
toward which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was now bending all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) thoughts and efforts; and
under the influence of this all-compelling demand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) nature, the
somewhat profuse man, who hated to be stinted or to stint any one else
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house, was gradually metamorphosed into the keen-eyed
grudger of morsels. Mrs. Tulliver could not economize enough to
satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in their food and firing; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would eat nothing
himself but what was of the coarsest quality. Tom, though depressed
and strongly repelled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's sullenness, and the dreariness
of home, entered thoroughly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's feelings about paying
the creditors; and the poor lad brought his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) first quarter's money,
with a delicious sense of achievement, and gave it to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father to
put into the tin box which held the savings. The little store of
sovereigns in the tin box seemed to be the only sight that brought a
faint beam of pleasure into the miller's eyes,--faint and transient,
for it was soon dispelled by the thought that the time would be
long--perhaps longer than his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) life,--before the narrow savings could
remove the hateful incubus of debt. A deficit of more than five
hundred pounds, with the accumulating interest, seemed a deep pit to
fill with the savings from thirty shillings a-week, even when Tom's
probable savings were to be added. On this one point there was entire
community of feeling in the four widely differing beings who sat round
the dying fire of sticks, which made a cheap warmth for them on the
verge of bedtime. Mrs. Tulliver carried the proud integrity of the
Dodsons in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) blood, and had been brought up to think that to wrong
people of their money, which was another phrase for debt, was a sort
of moral pillory; it would have been wickedness, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind, to have
run counter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband's desire to <div class="bookquote">``do the right thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>and
retrieve his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had a confused, dreamy notion that, if the
creditors were all paid, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) plate and linen ought to come back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had an inbred perception that while people owed money
they were unable to pay, they couldn't rightly call anything their
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) murmured a little that Mr. Tulliver so peremptorily refused
to receive anything in repayment from Mr. and Mrs. Moss; but to all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) requirements of household economy she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) was submissive to the point
of denying herself the cheapest indulgences of mere flavor; her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) only
rebellion was to smuggle into the kitchen something that would make
rather a better supper than usual for Tom.

<p/>These narrow notions about debt, held by the old fashioned Tullivers,
may perhaps excite a smile on the faces of many readers in these days
of wide commercial views and wide philosophy, according to which
everything rights itself without any trouble of ours. The fact that my
tradesman is out of pocket by me is to be looked at through the serene
certainty that somebody else's tradesman is in pocket by somebody
else; and since there must be bad debts in the world, why, it is mere
egoism not to like that we in particular should make them instead of
our fellow-citizens. I am telling the history of very simple people,
who had never had any illuminating doubts as to personal integrity and
honor.

<p/>Under all this grim melancholy and narrowing concentration of desire,
Mr. Tulliver retained the feeling toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``little wench''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow-citizens</b></font>) presence a need to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), though it would not suffice to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>fellow-citizens</b></font>) was still the desire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes; but the sweet spring of fatherly
love was now mingled with bitterness, like everything else. When
Maggie laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work at night, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) habit to get a low
stool and sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's knee, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek against it. How
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would stroke her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, or give some sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
soothed by the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a daughter who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! But now she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
got no answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) little caresses, either from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father or from
Tom,--the two idols of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) life. Tom was weary and abstracted in the
short intervals when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was at home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father was bitterly
preoccupied with the thought that the girl was growing up, was
shooting up into a woman; and how was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to do well in life? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
a poor chance for marrying, down in the world as they were. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
hated the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marrying poorly, as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt Gritty had done;
_that_ would be a thing to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turn in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave,--the little
wench so pulled down by children and toil, as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt Moss was. When
uncultured minds, confined to a narrow range of personal experience,
are under the pressure of continued misfortune, their inward life is
apt to become a perpetually repeated round of sad and bitter thoughts;
the same words, the same scenes, are revolved over and over again, the
same mood accompanies them; the end of the year finds them as much
what they were at the beginning as if they were machines set to a
recurrent series of movements.

<p/>The sameness of the days was broken by few visitors. Uncles and aunts
paid only short visits now; of course, they could not stay to meals,
and the constraint caused by Mr. Tulliver's savage silence, which
seemed to add to the hollow resonance of the bare, uncarpeted room
when the aunts were talking, heightened the unpleasantness of these
family visits on all sides, and tended to make them rare. As for other
acquaintances, there is a chill air surrounding those who are down in
the world, and people are glad to get away from them, as from a cold
room; human beings, mere men and women, without furniture, without
anything to offer you, who have ceased to count as anybody, present an
embarrassing negation of reasons for wishing to see them, or of
subjects on which to converse with them. At that distant day, there
was a dreary isolation in the civilized Christian society of these
realms for families that had dropped below their original level,
unless they belonged to a sectarian church, which gets some warmth of
brotherhood by walling in the sacred fire.



<p/>Chapter III

<p/>A Voice from the Past


<p/>One afternoon, when the chestnuts were coming into flower, Maggie had
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair outside the front door, and was seated there with a
book on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dark eyes had wandered from the book, but they
did not seem to be enjoying the sunshine which pierced the screen of
jasmine on the projecting porch at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) right, and threw leafy shadows
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pale round cheek; they seemed rather to be searching for
something that was not disclosed by the sunshine. It had been a more
miserable day than usual; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, after a visit of Wakem's had had
a paroxysm of rage, in which for some trifling fault he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had beaten the
boy who served in the mill. Once before, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) illness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had had
a similar paroxysm, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had beaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) horse, and the scene
had left a lasting terror in Maggie's mind. The thought had risen,
that some time or other he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) might beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) happened to
speak in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feeble way at the wrong moment. The keenest of all dread
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father should add to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) present misfortune the
wretchedness of doing something irretrievably disgraceful. The
battered school-book of Tom's which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees could give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) no fortitude under the pressure of that dread; and again and again
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes had filled with tears, as they wandered vaguely, seeing
neither the chestnut-trees, nor the distant horizon, but only future
scenes of home-sorrow.

<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of
footsteps on the gravel. It was not Tom who was entering, but a man in
a sealskin cap and a blue plush waistcoat, carrying a pack on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
back, and followed closely by a bullterrier of brindled coat and
defiant aspect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Bob, it's you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, starting up with a smile of pleased
recognition, for there had been no abundance of kind acts to efface
the recollection of Bob's generosity; <div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cap and showing a delighted
face, but immediately relieving himself of some accompanying
embarrassment by looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) dog, and saying in a tone of
disgust, <div class="bookquote">``Get out wi' you, you thunderin' sawney!''

 (<font color='red'><b>dog</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother is not at home yet, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is always at
St. Ogg's in the daytime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, <div class="bookquote">``I should be glad to see Mr. Tom, but that
isn't just what I'm come for,--look here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob was in the act of depositing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pack on the door-step, and with
it a row of small books fastened together with string.

<p/>Apparently, however, they were not the object to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wished to
call Maggie's attention, but rather something which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had carried
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arm, wrapped in a red handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said again, laying the red parcel on the others and
unfolding it; <div class="bookquote">``you won't think I'm a-makin' too free, Miss, I hope,
but I lighted on these books, and I thought they might make up to you
a bit for them as you've lost; for I heared you speak o' picturs,--an'
as for picturs, _look_ here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>The opening of the red handkerchief had disclosed a superannuated
<div class="bookquote">``Keepsake''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Eliot</b></font>)</div>and six or seven numbers of a <div class="bookquote">``Portrait Gallery,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Eliot</b></font>)</div>in royal
octavo; and the emphatic request to look referred to a portrait of
George the Fourth in all the majesty of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) depressed cranium and
voluminous neckcloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's all sorts o' genelmen here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>Bob went on, turning over the
leaves with some excitement, <div class="bookquote">``wi' all sorts o' nones,--an' some bald
an' some wi' wigs,--Parlament genelmen, I reckon. An' here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) added,
opening the <div class="bookquote">``Keepsake,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">''_here's_ ladies for you, some wi' curly hair
and some wi' smooth, an' some a-smiling wi' their heads o' one side,
an' some as if they were goin' to cry,--look here,--a-sittin' on the
ground out o' door, dressed like the ladies I'n seen get out o' the
carriages at the balls in th' Old Hall there. My eyes! I wonder what
the chaps wear as go a-courtin' 'em! I sot up till the clock was gone
twelve last night, a-lookin' at 'em,--I did,--till they stared at me
out o' the picturs as if they'd know when I spoke to 'em. But, lors! I
shouldn't know what to say to 'em. They'll be more fittin' company for
you, Miss; and the man at the book-stall, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said they banged
iverything for picturs; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said they was a fust-rate article.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've bought them for me, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, deeply touched by
this simple kindness. <div class="bookquote">``How very, very good of you! But I'm afraid you
gave a great deal of money for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``I'd ha' gev three times the money if they'll make
up to you a bit for them as was sold away from you, Miss.. For I'n
niver forgot how you looked when you fretted about the books bein'
gone; it's stuck by me as if it was a pictur hingin' before me. An'
when I see'd the book open upo' the stall, wi' the lady lookin' out of
it wi' eyes a bit like your'n when you was frettin',--you'll excuse my
takin' the liberty, Miss,--I thought I'd make free to buy it for you,
an' then I bought the books full o' genelmen to match; an' then'' (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>--here
Bob took up the small stringed packet of books--<div class="bookquote">``I thought you might
like a bit more print as well as the picturs, an' I got these for a
sayso,--they're cram-full o' print, an' I thought they'd do no harm
comin' along wi' these bettermost books. An' I hope you won't say me
nay, an' tell me as you won't have 'em, like Mr. Tom did wi' the
suvreigns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``I'm very thankful to you for thinking
of me, and being so good to me and Tom. I don't think any one ever did
such a kind thing for me before. I haven't many friends who care for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hev a dog, Miss!--they're better friends nor any Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said
Bob, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pack again, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had taken up with the
intention of hurrying away; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) felt considerable shyness in
talking to a young lass like Maggie, though, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) usually said of
himself, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) tongue overrun him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) began to speak. <div class="bookquote">``I can't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, Bob. We have a yard dog, and I mayn't keep a dog of my

the chaps can put into their talk from breakfast to sundown. There's
one chap carries pots,--a poor, low trade as any on the road,--he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
says, ``Why Toby's nought but a mongrel; there's nought to look at in
her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>).'' But I says to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), ``Why, what are you yoursen but a mongrel?
There wasn't much pickin' o' _your_ feyther an' mother, to look at
you.<div class="bookquote">'' Not but I like a bit o' breed myself, but I can't abide to see
one cur grinnin' at another. I wish you good evenin', Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>feyther an mother</b></font>)</div>said Bob,
abruptly taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pack again, under the consciousness that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
tongue was acting in an undisciplined manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you come in the evening some time, and see my brother, Bob?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss, thank you--another time. You'll give my duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), if
you please. Eh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s a fine growed chap, Mr. Tom is; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took to
growin' i' the legs, an' _I_ didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pack was down again, now, the hook of the stick having somehow
gone wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't call Mumps a cur, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, divining that
any interest she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) showed in Mumps would be gratifying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Miss, a fine way off that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, with pitying smile; <div class="bookquote">``Mumps
is as fine a cross as you'll see anywhere along the Floss, an' I'n
been up it wi' the barge times enow. Why, the gentry stops to look at
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>); but you won't catch Mumps a-looking at the gentry much,--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) minds
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) own business, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>The expression of Mump's face, which seemed to be tolerating the
superfluous existence of objects in general, was strongly confirmatory
of this high praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) looks dreadfully surly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) let me pat him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that would he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>), and thank you. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) company, Mumps does.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) isn't a dog as `ull be caught wi' gingerbread; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>)'d smell a thief a
good deal stronger nor the gingerbread, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) would. Lors, I talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>)
by th' hour together, when I'm walking i' lone places, and if I'n done
a bit o' mischief, I allays tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>). I'n got no secrets but what
Mumps knows 'em. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) knows about my big thumb, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your big thumb--what's that, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what it is, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, quickly, exhibiting a singularly
broad specimen of that difference between the man and the monkey. <div class="bookquote">``It
tells i' measuring out the flannel, you see. I carry flannel, 'cause
it's light for my pack, an' it's dear stuff, you see, so a big thumb
tells. I clap my thumb at the end o' the yard and cut o' the hither
side of it, and the old women aren't up to`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking serious, <div class="bookquote">``that's cheating; I don't
like to hear you say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you, Miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob regretfully. <div class="bookquote">``Then I'm sorry I said it.
But I'm so used to talking to Mumps, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) doesn't mind a bit o'
cheating, when it's them skinflint women, as haggle an' haggle, an'
`ud like to get their flannel for nothing, an' `ud niver ask
theirselves how I got my dinner out on't. I niver cheat anybody as
doesn't want to cheat me, Miss,--lors, I'm a honest chap, I am; only I
must hev a bit o' sport, an' now I don't go wi' th' ferrets, I'n got
no varmint to come over but them haggling women. I wish you good
evening, Miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by, Bob. Thank you very much for bringing me the books. And come
again to see Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, moving on a few steps; then turning half round
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave off that trick wi' my big thumb, if you don't
think well on me for it, Miss; but it `ud be a pity, it would. I
couldn't find another trick so good,--an' what `ud be the use o'
havin' a big thumb? It might as well ha' been narrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, thus exalted into Bob's exalting Madonna, laughed in spite of
herself; at which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) worshipper's blue eyes twinkled too, and under
these favoring auspices he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cap and walked away.

<p/>The days of chivalry are not gone, notwithstanding Burke's grand dirge
over them; they live still in that far-off worship paid by many a
youth and man to the woman of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never dreams that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall touch
so much as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little finger or the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) robe. Bob, with the
pack on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) back, had as respectful an adoration for this dark-eyed
maiden as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had been a knight in armor calling aloud on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pricked on to the fight.

<p/>That gleam of merriment soon died away from Maggie's face, and perhaps
only made the returning gloom deeper by contrast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was too
dispirited even to like answering questions about Bob's present of
books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) carried them away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bedroom, laying them down
there and seating herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) one stool, without caring to look at
them just yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek against the window-frame, and
thought that the light-hearted Bob had a lot much happier than hers.

<p/>Maggie's sense of loneliness, and utter privation of joy, had deepened
with the brightness of advancing spring. All the favorite outdoor
nooks about home, which seemed to have done their part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
parents in nurturing and cherishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), were now mixed up with the
home-sadness, and gathered no smile from the sunshine. Every
affection, every delight the poor child had had, was like an aching
nerve to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). There was no music for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) any more,--no piano, no
harmonized voices, no delicious stringed instruments, with their
passionate cries of imprisoned spirits sending a strange vibration
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) frame. And of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) school-life there was nothing left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) little collection of school-books, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned
over with a sickening sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew them all, and they were all
barren of comfort. Even at school she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had often wished for books with
_more_ in them; everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) learned there seemed like the ends of
long threads that snapped immediately. And now--without the indirect
charm of school-emulation--Télémaque was mere bran; so were the hard,
dry questions on Christian Doctrine; there was no flavor in them, no
strength. Sometimes Maggie thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could have been contented with
absorbing fancies; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could have had all Scott's novels and all
Byron's poems!--then, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have found happiness enough
to dull her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sensibility to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) actual daily life. And yet they were
hardly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could make dream-worlds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, but no
dream-world would satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted some explanation of this
hard, real life,--the unhappy-looking father, seated at the dull
breakfast-table; the childish, bewildered mother; the little sordid
tasks that filled the hours, or the more oppressive emptiness of
weary, joyless leisure; the need of some tender, demonstrative love;
the cruel sense that Tom didn't mind what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought or felt, and
that they were no longer playfellows together; the privation of all
pleasant things that had come to _her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)_ more than to others,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wanted some key that would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to understand, and in
understanding, to endure, the heavy weight that had fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
young heart. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been taught <div class="bookquote">``real learning and wisdom, such as
great men knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should have held the secrets of life;
if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had only books, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might learn for herself what wise men
knew! Saints and martyrs had never interested Maggie so much as sages
and poets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew little of saints and martyrs, and had gathered, as
a general result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) teaching, that they were a temporary provision
against the spread of Catholicism, and had all died at Smithfield.

<p/>In one of these meditations it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had forgotten
Tom's school-books, which had been sent home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) trunk. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
found the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few old ones which
had been well thumbed,--the Latin Dictionary and Grammar, a Delectus,
a torn Eutropius, the well-worn Virgil, Aldrich's Logic, and the
exasperating Euclid. Still, Latin, Euclid, and Logic would surely be a
considerable step in masculine wisdom,--in that knowledge which made
men contented, and even glad to live. Not that the yearning for
effectual wisdom was quite unmixed; a certain mirage would now and
then rise on the desert of the future, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) seemed to see
herself honored for her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) surprising attainments. And so the poor child,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) soul's hunger and her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) illusions of self-flattery, began to
nibble at this thick-rinded fruit of the tree of knowledge, filling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) vacant hours with Latin, geometry, and the forms of the syllogism,
and feeling a gleam of triumph now and then that her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) understanding was
quite equal to these peculiarly masculine studies. For a week or two
she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) went on resolutely enough, though with an occasional sinking of
heart, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) had set out toward the Promised Land alone, and found
it a thirsty, trackless, uncertain journey. In the severity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>)
early resolution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) would take Aldrich out into the fields, and then
look off her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) book toward the sky, where the lark was twinkling, or to
the reeds and bushes by the river, from which the waterfowl rustled
forth on its anxious, awkward flight,--with a startled sense that the
relation between Aldrich and this living world was extremely remote
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>). The discouragement deepened as the days went on, and the
eager heart gained faster and faster on the patient mind. Somehow,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) sat at the window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) book, her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) eyes _would_ fix
themselves blankly on the outdoor sunshine; then they would fill with
tears, and sometimes, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) mother was not in the room, the studies
would all end in sobbing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) rebelled against her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) lot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) fainted
under its loneliness, and fits even of anger and hatred toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>)
father and mother, who were so unlike what she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) would have them to be;
toward Tom, who checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>), and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) thought or feeling always by
some thwarting difference,--would flow out over her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) affections and
conscience like a lava stream, and frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) with a sense that it
was not difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) to become a demon. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) brain would be
busy with wild romances of a flight from home in search of something
less sordid and dreary; she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) would go to some great man--Walter Scott,
perhaps--and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) how wretched and how clever she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>)
would surely do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>). But, in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) vision,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) father would perhaps enter the room for the evening, and,
surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) sat still without noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), would say
complainingly, <div class="bookquote">``Come, am I to fetch my slippers myself?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The voice
pierced through Maggie like a sword; there was another sadness besides
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been thinking of turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) back on it and
forsaking it.

<p/>This afternoon, the sight of Bob's cheerful freckled face had given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) discontent a new direction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought it was part of the
hardship of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life that there was laid upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the burthen of
larger wants than others seemed to feel,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to endure this
wide, hopeless yearning for that something, whatever it was, that was
greatest and best on this earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could have been like
Bob, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) easily satisfied ignorance, or like Tom, who had
something to do on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind with a steady purpose,
and disregard everything else. Poor child! as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head
against the window-frame, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands clasped tighter and tighter,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) foot beating the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was as lonely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) trouble as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been the only girl in the civilized world of that day who
had come out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) school-life with a soul untrained for inevitable
struggles, with no other part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inherited share in the hard-won
treasures of thought which generations of painful toil have laid up
for the race of men, than shreds and patches of feeble literature and
false history, with much futile information about Saxon and other
kings of doubtful example, but unhappily quite without that knowledge
of the irreversible laws within and without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), which, governing the
habits, becomes morality, and developing the feelings of submission
and dependence, becomes religion,--as lonely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) trouble as if
every other girl besides herself had been cherished and watched over
by elder minds, not forgetful of their own early time, when need was
keen and impulse strong.

<p/>At last Maggie's eyes glanced down on the books that lay on the
window-shelf, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) half forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reverie to turn over listlessly
the leaves of the <div class="bookquote">``Portrait Gallery,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soon pushed this aside
to examine the little row of books tied together with string.
<div class="bookquote">``Beauties of the Spectator,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rasselas,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Economy of Human Life,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gregory's Letters,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew the sort of matter that was inside all
these; the <div class="bookquote">``Christian Year,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--that seemed to be a hymnbook, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
laid it down again; but _Thomas à Kempis?_--the name had come across
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reading, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt the satisfaction, which every one
knows, of getting some ideas to attach to a name that strays solitary
in the memory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took up the little, old, clumsy book with some
curiosity; it had the corners turned down in many places, and some
hand, now forever quiet, had made at certain passages strong
pen-and-ink marks, long since browned by time. Maggie turned from leaf
to leaf, and read where the quiet hand pointed: <div class="bookquote">``Know that the love of
thyself doth hurt thee more than anything in the world... If thou
seekest this or that, and wouldst be here or there to enjoy thy own
will and pleasure, thou shalt never be quiet nor free from care; for
in everything somewhat will be wanting, and in every place there will
be some that will cross thee... Both above and below, which way
soever thou dost turn thee, everywhere thou shalt find the Cross; and
everywhere of necessity thou must have patience, if thou wilt have
inward peace, and enjoy an everlasting crown... If thou desirest to
mount unto this height, thou must set out courageously, and lay the
axe to the root, that thou mayest pluck up and destroy that hidden
inordinate inclination to thyself, and unto all private and earthly
good. On this sin, that a man inordinately loveth himself, almost all
dependeth, whatsoever is thoroughly to be overcome; which evil being
once overcome and subdued, there will presently ensue great peace and
tranquillity... It is but little thou sufferest in comparison of them
that have suffered so much, were so strongly tempted, so grievously
afflicted, so many ways tried and exercised. Thou oughtest therefore
to call to mind the more heavy sufferings of others, that thou mayest
the easier bear thy little adversities. And if they seem not little
unto thee, beware lest thy impatience be the cause thereof... Blessed
are those ears that receive the whispers of the divine voice, and
listen not to the whisperings of the world. Blessed are those ears
which hearken not unto the voice which soundeth outwardly, but unto
the Truth, which teacheth inwardly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>A strange thrill of awe passed through Maggie while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) read, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been wakened in the night by a strain of solemn music, telling
of beings whose souls had been astir while hers was in stupor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
went on from one brown mark to another, where the quiet hand seemed to
point, hardly conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was reading, seeming rather to listen
while a low voice said;

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why dost thou here gaze about, since this is not the place of thy
rest? In heaven ought to be thy dwelling, and all earthly things are
to be looked on as they forward thy journey thither. All things pass
away, and thou together with them. Beware thou cleavest not unto them,
lest thou be entangled and perish... If a man should give all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
substance, yet it is as nothing. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should do great penances,
yet are they but little. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should attain to all knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is yet far off. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be of great virtue, and very fervent
devotion, yet is there much wanting; to wit, one thing, which is most
necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What is that? That having left all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leave
himself, and go wholly out of himself, and retain nothing of
self-love... I have often said unto thee, and now again I say the
same, Forsake thyself, resign thyself, and thou shalt enjoy much
inward peace... Then shall all vain imaginations, evil perturbations,
and superfluous cares fly away; then shall immoderate fear leave thee,
and inordinate love shall die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie drew a long breath and pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heavy hair back, as if to see
a sudden vision more clearly. Here, then, was a secret of life that
would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to renounce all other secrets; here was a sublime
height to be reached without the help of outward things; here was
insight, and strength, and conquest, to be won by means entirely
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own soul, where a supreme Teacher was waiting to be heard.
It flashed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) like the suddenly apprehended solution of a
problem, that all the miseries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) young life had come from fixing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own pleasure, as if that were the central necessity
of the universe; and for the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw the possibility of
shifting the position from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked at the gratification of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own desires,--of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stand out of herself, and looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own life as an insignificant part of a divinely guided whole. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
read on and on in the old book, devouring eagerly the dialogues with
the invisible Teacher, the pattern of sorrow, the source of all
strength; returning to it after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been called away, and reading
till the sun went down behind the willows. With all the hurry of an
imagination that could never rest in the present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat in the
deepening twilight forming plans of self-humiliation and entire
devotedness; and in the ardor of first discovery, renunciation seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the entrance into that satisfaction which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had so long been
craving in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not perceived--how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
lived longer?--the inmost truth of the old monk's out-pourings, that
renunciation remains sorrow, though a sorrow borne willingly. Maggie
was still panting for happiness, and was in ecstasy because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
found the key to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew nothing of doctrines and systems, of
mysticism or quietism; but this voice out of the far-off middle ages
was the direct communication of a human soul's belief and experience,
and came to Maggie as an unquestioned message.

<p/>I suppose that is the reason why the small old-fashioned book, for
which you need only pay sixpence at a book-stall, works miracles to
this day, turning bitter waters into sweetness; while expensive
sermons and treatises, newly issued, leave all things as they were
before. It was written down by a hand that waited for the heart's
prompting; it is the chronicle of a solitary, hidden anguish,
struggle, trust, and triumph, not written on velvet cushions to teach
endurance to those who are treading with bleeding feet on the stones.
And so it remains to all time a lasting record of human needs and
human consolations; the voice of a brother who, ages ago, felt and
suffered and renounced,--in the cloister, perhaps, with serge gown and
tonsured head, with much chanting and long fasts, and with a fashion
of speech different from ours,--but under the same silent far-off
heavens, and with the same passionate desires, the same strivings, the
same failures, the same weariness.

<p/>In writing the history of unfashionable families, one is apt to fall
into a tone of emphasis which is very far from being the tone of good
society, where principles and beliefs are not only of an extremely
moderate kind, but are always presupposed, no subjects being eligible
but such as can be touched with a light and graceful irony. But then
good society has its claret and its velvet carpets, its
dinner-engagements six weeks deep, its opera and its faëry ball-rooms;
rides off its _ennui_ on thoroughbred horses; lounges at the club; has
to keep clear of crinoline vortices; gets its science done by Faraday,
and its religion by the superior clergy who are to be met in the best
houses,--how should it have time or need for belief and emphasis? But
good society, floated on gossamer wings of light irony, is of very
expensive production; requiring nothing less than a wide and arduous
national life condensed in unfragrant deafening factories, cramping
itself in mines, sweating at furnaces, grinding, hammering, weaving
under more or less oppression of carbonic acid, or else, spread over
sheepwalks, and scattered in lonely houses and huts on the clayey or
chalky corn-lands, where the rainy days look dreary. This wide
national life is based entirely on emphasis,--the emphasis of want,
which urges it into all the activities necessary for the maintenance
of good society and light irony; it spends its heavy years often in a
chill, uncarpeted fashion, amidst family discord unsoftened by long
corridors. Under such circumstances, there are many among its myriads
of souls who have absolutely needed an emphatic belief, life in this
unpleasurable shape demanding some solution even to unspeculative
minds,--just as you inquire into the stuffing of your couch when
anything galls you there, whereas eider-down and perfect French
springs excite no question. Some have an emphatic belief in alcohol,
and seek their _ekstasis_ or outside standing-ground in gin; but the
rest require something that good society calls <div class="bookquote">``enthusiasm,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>something
that will present motives in an entire absence of high prizes;
something that will give patience and feed human love when the limbs
ache with weariness, and human looks are hard upon us; something,
clearly, that lies outside personal desires, that includes resignation
for ourselves and active love for what is not ourselves. Now and then
that sort of enthusiasm finds a far-echoing voice that comes from an
experience springing out of the deepest need; and it was by being
brought within the long lingering vibrations of such a voice that
Maggie, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) girl's face and unnoted sorrows, found an effort and
a hope that helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) through years of loneliness, making out a faith
for herself without the aid of established authorities and appointed
guides; for they were not at hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) need was pressing. From
what you know of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), you will not be surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) threw some
exaggeration and wilfulness, some pride and impetuosity, even into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
self-renunciation; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own life was still a drama for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) demanded of herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part should be played with intensity.
And so it came to pass that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) often lost the spirit of humility by
being excessive in the outward act; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) often strove after too high a
flight, and came down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) poor little half-fledged wings dabbled
in the mud. For example, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) not only determined to work at plain
sewing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might contribute something toward the fund in the tin
box, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went, in the first instance, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) zeal of
self-mortification, to ask for it at a linen shop in St. Ogg's,
instead of getting it in a more quiet and indirect way; and could see
nothing but what was entirely wrong and unkind, nay, persecuting, in
Tom's reproof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for this unnecessary act. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like _my_
sister to do such things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">''_I'll_ take care that the debts
are paid, without your lowering yourself in that way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Surely there
was some tenderness and bravery mingled with the worldliness and
self-assertion of that little speech; but Maggie held it as dross,
overlooking the grains of gold, and took Tom's rebuke as one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
outward crosses. Tom was very hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) used to think, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
long night-watchings,--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) who had always loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so; and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) strove to be contented with that hardness, and to require nothing.
That is the path we all like when we set out on our abandonment of
egoism,--the path of martyrdom and endurance, where the palm-branches
grow, rather than the steep highway of tolerance, just allowance, and
self-blame, where there are no leafy honors to be gathered and worn.

<p/>The old books, Virgil, Euclid, and Aldrich--that wrinkled fruit of the
tree of knowledge--had been all laid by; for Maggie had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
back on the vain ambition to share the thoughts of the wise. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
first ardor she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) flung away the books with a sort of triumph that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had risen above the need of them; and if they had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
would have burned them, believing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would never repent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
read so eagerly and constantly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) three books, the Bible, Thomas à
Kempis, and the <div class="bookquote">``Christian Year''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas à Kempis</b></font>)</div>-LRB-no longer rejected as a
<div class="bookquote">``hymn-book'' (<font color='red'><b>Thomas à Kempis</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, that they filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind with a continual stream of
rhythmic memories; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was too ardently learning to see all nature
and life in the light of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) new faith, to need any other material for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind to work on, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) well-plied needle, making
shirts and other complicated stitchings, falsely called <div class="bookquote">``plain,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--by
no means plain to Maggie, since wristband and sleeve and the like had
a capability of being sewed in wrong side outward in moments of mental
wandering.

<p/>Hanging diligently over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sewing, Maggie was a sight any one might
have been pleased to look at. That new inward life of hers,
notwithstanding some volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions, yet
shone out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face with a tender soft light that mingled itself as
added loveliness with the gradually enriched color and outline of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
blossoming youth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother felt the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with a sort of
puzzled wonder that Maggie should be <div class="bookquote">``growing up so good'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>; it was
amazing that this once <div class="bookquote">``contrairy''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>child was become so submissive, so
backward to assert her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own will. Maggie used to look up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work
and find her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); they were watching and
waiting for the large young glance, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) elder frame got some
needful warmth from it. The mother was getting fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tall, brown
girl,--the only bit of furniture now on which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
anxiety and pride; and Maggie, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own ascetic wish to
have no personal adornment, was obliged to give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair, and submit to have the abundant black locks plaited
into a coronet on the summit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, after the pitiable fashion
of those antiquated times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let your mother have that bit o' pleasure, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``I'd trouble enough with your hair once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>So Maggie, glad of anything that would soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, and cheer
their long day together, consented to the vain decoration, and showed
a queenly head above her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old frocks, steadily refusing, however, to
look at herself in the glass. Mrs. Tulliver liked to call the father's
attention to Maggie's hair and other unexpected virtues, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a
brusk reply to give.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew well enough what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d be, before now,--it's nothing new to
me. But it's a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) isn't made o' commoner stuff; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll be thrown
away, I doubt,--there'll be nobody to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as is fit for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>And Maggie's graces of mind and body fed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gloom. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat patiently
enough while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) read him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a chapter, or said something timidly when
they were alone together about trouble being turned into a blessing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took it all as part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's goodness, which made his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
misfortunes the sadder to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) because they damaged her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) chance in life.
In a mind charged with an eager purpose and an unsatisfied
vindictiveness, there is no room for new feelings; Mr. Tulliver did
not want spiritual consolation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wanted to shake off the degradation
of debt, and to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) revenge.




<p/>Book V

<p/>_Wheat and Tares_



<p/>Chapter I

<p/>In the Red Deeps


<p/>The family sitting-room was a long room with a window at each end; one
looking toward the croft and along the Ripple to the banks of the
Floss, the other into the mill-yard. Maggie was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work
against the latter window when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw Mr. Wakem entering the yard, as
usual, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) fine black horse; but not alone, as usual. Some one was
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>),--a figure in a cloak, on a handsome pony. Maggie had hardly
time to feel that it was Philip come back, before they were in front
of the window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); while his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father,
catching the movement by a side-glance, looked sharply round at them
both.

<p/>Maggie hurried away from the window and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work upstairs; for
Mr. Wakem sometimes came in and inspected the books, and Maggie felt
that the meeting with Philip would be robbed of all pleasure in the
presence of the two fathers. Some day, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) when
they could just shake hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) goodness to Tom, and the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in
the old days, though they could never be friends any more. It was not
at all agitating to Maggie to see Philip again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
childish gratitude and pity toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cleverness;
and in the early weeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loneliness she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had continually recalled
the image of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) among the people who had been kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in life,
often wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for a brother and a teacher, as they had
fancied it might have been, in their talk together. But that sort of
wishing had been banished along with other dreams that savored of
seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own will; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought, besides, that Philip might be
altered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) life abroad,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might have become worldly, and really
not care about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saying anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) now. And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face was
wonderfully little altered,--it was only a larger, more manly copy of
the pale, small-featured boy's face, with the gray eyes, and the
boyish waving brown hair; there was the old deformity to awaken the
old pity; and after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meditations, Maggie felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) really
_should_ like to say a few words to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might still be melancholy,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always used to be, and like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kindly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes; with that
thought Maggie glanced toward the square looking-glass which was
condemned to hang with its face toward the wall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) half started
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seat to reach it down; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) checked herself and snatched
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work, trying to repress the rising wishes by forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) memory
to recall snatches of hymns, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw Philip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father
returning along the road, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could go down again.

<p/>It was far on in June now, and Maggie was inclined to lengthen the
daily walk which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) one indulgence; but this day and the
following she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was so busy with work which must be finished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
never went beyond the gate, and satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) need of the open air by
sitting out of doors. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) frequent walks, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not
obliged to go to St. Ogg's, was to a spot that lay beyond what was
called the <div class="bookquote">``Hill,'' (<font color='red'><b>St. Ogg/Ogg</b></font>)</div>--an insignificant rise of ground crowned by trees,
lying along the side of the road which ran by the gates of Dorlcote
Mill. Insignificant I call it, because in height it was hardly more
than a bank; but there may come moments when Nature makes a mere bank
a means toward a fateful result; and that is why I ask you to imagine
this high bank crowned with trees, making an uneven wall for some
quarter of a mile along the left side of Dorlcote Mill and the
pleasant fields behind it, bounded by the murmuring Ripple. Just where
this line of bank sloped down again to the level, a by-road turned off
and led to the other side of the rise, where it was broken into very
capricious hollows and mounds by the working of an exhausted
stone-quarry, so long exhausted that both mounds and hollows were now
clothed with brambles and trees, and here and there by a stretch of
grass which a few sheep kept close-nibbled. In her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) childish days
Maggie held this place, called the Red Deeps, in very great awe, and
needed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) confidence in Tom's bravery to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to an
excursion thither,--visions of robbers and fierce animals haunting
every hollow. But now it had the charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) which any broken
ground, any mimic rock and ravine, have for the eyes that rest
habitually on the level; especially in summer, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could sit on a
grassy hollow under the shadow of a branching ash, stooping aslant
from the steep above her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and listen to the hum of insects, like
tiniest bells on the garment of Silence, or see the sunlight piercing
the distant boughs, as if to chase and drive home the truant heavenly
blue of the wild hyacinths. In this June time, too, the dog-roses were
in their glory, and that was an additional reason why Maggie should
direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walk to the Red Deeps, rather than to any other spot, on
the first day she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was free to wander at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will,--a pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
loved so well, that sometimes, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ardors of renunciation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ought to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it.

<p/>You may see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walks down the favorite turning and enters
the Deeps by a narrow path through a group of Scotch firs, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tall
figure and old lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk
shawl of some wide-meshed net-like material; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is sure of
being unseen she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) takes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet and ties it over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm. One
would certainly suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to be farther on in life than her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
seventeenth year--perhaps because of the slow resigned sadness of the
glance from which all search and unrest seem to have departed; perhaps
because her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) broad-chested figure has the mould of early womanhood.
Youth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary
hardships of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lot, and the nights in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has lain on the hard
floor for a penance have left no obvious trace; the eyes are liquid,
the brown cheek is firm and round, the full lips are red. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
dark coloring and jet crown surmounting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tall figure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seems to
have a sort of kinship with the grand Scotch firs, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is
looking up as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loved them well. Yet one has a sense of
uneasiness in looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),--a sense of opposing elements, of which
a fierce collision is imminent; surely there is a hushed expression,
such as one often sees in older faces under borderless caps, out of
keeping with the resistant youth, which one expects to flash out in a
sudden, passionate glance, that will dissipate all the quietude, like
a damp fire leaping out again when all seemed safe.

<p/>But Maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was calmly
enjoying the free air, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked up at the old fir-trees, and
thought that those broken ends of branches were the records of past
storms, which had only made the red stems soar higher. But while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
eyes were still turned upward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) became conscious of a moving shadow
cast by the evening sun on the grassy path before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and looked down
with a startled gesture to see Philip Wakem, who first raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) hat,
and then, blushing deeply, came forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) hand.
Maggie, too, colored with surprise, which soon gave way to pleasure.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand and looked down at the deformed figure before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
with frank eyes, filled for the moment with nothing but the memory of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) child's feelings,--a memory that was always strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
the first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You startled me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, smiling faintly; <div class="bookquote">``I never meet any one
here. How came you to be walking here? Did you come to meet _me?_''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impossible not to perceive that Maggie felt herself a child
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, still embarrassed; <div class="bookquote">``I wished to see you
very much. I watched a long while yesterday on the bank near your
house to see if you would come out, but you never came. Then I watched
again to-day, and when I saw the way you took, I kept you in sight and
came down the bank, behind there. I hope you will not be displeased
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with simple seriousness, walking on as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meant
Philip to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad you came, for I wished very
much to have an opportunity of speaking to you. I've never forgotten
how good you were long ago to Tom, and me too; but I was not sure that
you would remember us so well. Tom and I have had a great deal of
trouble since then, and I think _that_ makes one think more of what
happened before the trouble came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe that you have thought of me so much as I have thought
of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, timidly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, when I was away, I made a
picture of you as you looked that morning in the study when you said
you would not forget me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip drew a large miniature-case from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pocket, and opened it.
Maggie saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old self leaning on a table, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) black locks
hanging down behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ears, looking into space, with strange, dreamy
eyes. It was a water-color sketch, of real merit as a portrait.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling, and flushed with pleasure, <div class="bookquote">``what a
queer little girl I was! I remember myself with my hair in that way,
in that pink frock. I really _was_ like a gypsy. I dare say I am now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, after a little pause; <div class="bookquote">``am I like what you expected me to
be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The words might have been those of a coquette, but the full, bright
glance Maggie turned on Philip was not that of a coquette. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) really
did hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face as it was now, but it was simply the rising
again of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) innate delight in admiration and love. Philip met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
eyes and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in silence for a long moment, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said
quietly, <div class="bookquote">``No, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The light died out a little from Maggie's face, and there was a slight
trembling of the lip. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyelids fell lower, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not turn
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, and Philip continued to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said
slowly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very much more beautiful than I thought you would be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, the pleasure returning in a deeper flush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and took some steps, looking straight
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in silence, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consciousness to
this new idea. Girls are so accustomed to think of dress as the main
ground of vanity, that, in abstaining from the looking-glass, Maggie
had thought more of abandoning all care for adornment than of
renouncing the contemplation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face. Comparing herself with
elegant, wealthy young ladies, it had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could produce any effect with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) person. Philip seemed to like the
silence well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face, as if that
sight left no room for any other wish. They had passed from among the
fir-trees, and had now come to a green hollow almost surrounded by an
amphitheatre of the pale pink dog-roses. But as the light about them
had brightened, Maggie's face had lost its glow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood still when they were in the hollows, and looking at Philip
again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said in a serious, sad voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we could have been friends,--I mean, if it would have been
good and right for us. But that is the trial I have to bear in
everything; I may not keep anything I used to love when I was little.
The old books went; and Tom is different, and my father. It is like
death. I must part with everything I cared for when I was a child. And
I must part with you; we must never take any notice of each other
again. That was what I wanted to speak to you for. I wanted to let you
know that Tom and I can't do as we like about such things, and that if
I behave as if I had forgotten all about you, it is not out of envy or
pride--or--or any bad feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie spoke with more and more sorrowful gentleness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes began to fill with tears. The deepening expression of
pain on Philip's face gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a stronger resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) boyish
self, and made the deformity appeal more strongly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know; I see all that you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, in a voice that had become
feebler from discouragement; <div class="bookquote">``I know what there is to keep us apart on
both sides. But it is not right, Maggie,--don't you be angry with me,
I am so used to call you Maggie in my thoughts,--it is not right to
sacrifice everything to other people's unreasonable feelings. I would
give up a great deal for _my_ father; but I would not give up a
friendship or--or an attachment of any sort, in obedience to any wish
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that I didn't recognize as right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, musingly. <div class="bookquote">``Often, when I have been angry
and discontented, it has seemed to me that I was not bound to give up
anything; and I have gone on thinking till it has seemed to me that I
could think away all my duty. But no good has ever come of that; it
was an evil state of mind. I'm quite sure that whatever I might do, I
should wish in the end that I had gone without anything for myself,
rather than have made my father's life harder to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But would it make his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life harder if we were to see each other
sometimes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was going to say something else, but
checked himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn't like it. Don't ask me why, or anything about
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a distressed tone. <div class="bookquote">``My father feels so strongly
about some things. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not at all happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, impetuously; <div class="bookquote">``I am not happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, gently. <div class="bookquote">``At least--I ought not to ask--but I'm
very, very sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip turned to walk on, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not patience to stand still any
longer, and they went out of the hollow, winding amongst the trees and
bushes in silence. After that last word of Philip's, Maggie could not
bear to insist immediately on their parting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been a great deal happier,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said at last, timidly, <div class="bookquote">``since I
have given up thinking about what is easy and pleasant, and being
discontented because I couldn't have my own will. Our life is
determined for us; and it makes the mind very free when we give up
wishing, and only think of bearing what is laid upon us, and doing
what is given us to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't give up wishing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to
me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly
alive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and
we _must_ hunger after them. How can we ever be satisfied without them
until our feelings are deadened? I delight in fine pictures; I long to
be able to paint such. I strive and strive, and can't produce what I
want. That is pain to me, and always _will_ be pain, until my
faculties lose their keenness, like aged eyes. Then there are many
other things I long for,'' (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>--here Philip hesitated a little, and then
said,--<div class="bookquote">``things that other men have, and that will always be denied me.
My life will have nothing great or beautiful in it; I would rather not
have lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you didn't feel so.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart
began to beat with something of Philip's discontent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), turning quickly round and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gray eyes
entreatingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``I should be contented to live, if you would
let me see you sometimes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, checked by a fear which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face
suggested, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked away again and said more calmly, <div class="bookquote">``I have no
friend to whom I can tell everything, no one who cares enough about
me; and if I could only see you now and then, and you would let me
talk to you a little, and show me that you cared for me, and that we
may always be friends in heart, and help each other, then I might come
to be glad of life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can I see you, Philip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, falteringly. -LRB-Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
really do him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) good? It would be very hard to say <div class="bookquote">``good-by''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>this day,
and not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) again. Here was a new interest to vary the days;
it was so much easier to renounce the interest before it came.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would let me see you here sometimes,--walk with you here,--I
would be contented if it were only once or twice in a month. _That_
could injure no one's happiness, and it would sweeten my life.
Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>Philip went on, with all the inventive astuteness of love at
one-and-twenty, <div class="bookquote">``if there is any enmity between those who belong to
us, we ought all the more to try and quench it by our friendship; I
mean, that by our influence on both sides we might bring about a
healing of the wounds that have been made in the past, if I could know
everything about them. And I don't believe there is any enmity in my
own father's mind; I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has proved the contrary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head slowly, and was silent, under conflicting
thoughts. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inclination, that to see Philip now and
then, and keep up the bond of friendship with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), was something not
only innocent, but good; perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might really help him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to find
contentment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had found it. The voice that said this made sweet
music to Maggie; but athwart it there came an urgent, monotonous
warning from another voice which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been learning to obey,--the
warning that such interviews implied secrecy; implied doing something
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would dread to be discovered in, something that, if discovered,
must cause anger and pain; and that the admission of anything so near
doubleness would act as a spiritual blight. Yet the music would swell
out again, like chimes borne onward by a recurrent breeze, persuading
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that the wrong lay all in the faults and weaknesses of others, and
that there was such a thing as futile sacrifice for one to the injury
of another. It was very cruel for Philip that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should be shrunk
from, because of an unjustifiable vindictiveness toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
father,--poor Philip, whom some people would shrink from only because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was deformed. The idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might become her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lover or that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could cause disapproval in that light, had not occurred to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and Philip saw the absence of this idea clearly enough, saw it
with a certain pang, although it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) request the
less unlikely. There was bitterness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in the perception that
Maggie was almost as frank and unconstrained toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say either yes or no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said at last, turning round and
walking toward the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) come; <div class="bookquote">``I must wait, lest I should decide
wrongly. I must seek for guidance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I come again, then, to-morrow, or the next day, or next week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I had better write,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, faltering again. <div class="bookquote">``I have to
go to St. Ogg's sometimes, and I can put the letter in the post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip eagerly; <div class="bookquote">``that would not be so well. My father
might see the letter--and--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has not any enmity, I believe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
views things differently from me; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks a great deal about wealth
and position. Pray let me come here once more. _Tell_ me when it shall
be; or if you can't tell me, I will come as often as I can till I do
see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it must be so, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``for I can't be quite
certain of coming here any particular evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie felt a great relief in adjourning the decision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was free
now to enjoy the minutes of companionship; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) almost thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might linger a little; the next time they met she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have to pain
Philip by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) determination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, looking smilingly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), after a
few moments of silence, <div class="bookquote">``how strange it is that we should have met and
talked to each other, just as if it had been only yesterday when we
parted at Lorton. And yet we must both be very much altered in those
five years,--I think it is five years. How was it you seemed to have a
sort of feeling that I was the same Maggie? I was not quite so sure
that you would be the same; I know you are so clever, and you must
have seen and learnt so much to fill your mind; I was not quite sure
you would care about me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never had any doubt that you would be the same, whenever I
might see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip,--<div class="bookquote">``I mean, the same in everything that made
me like you better than any one else. I don't want to explain that; I
don't think any of the strongest effects our natures are susceptible
of can ever be explained. We can neither detect the process by which
they are arrived at, nor the mode in which they act on us. The
greatest of painters only once painted a mysteriously divine child; he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
couldn't have told how he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did it, and we can't tell why we feel it to
be divine. I think there are stores laid up in our human nature that
our understandings can make no complete inventory of. Certain strains
of music affect me so strangely; I can never hear them without their
changing my whole attitude of mind for a time, and if the effect would
last, I might be capable of heroisms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I know what you mean about music; _I_ feel so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old impetuosity. <div class="bookquote">``At least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, in
a saddened tone, <div class="bookquote">``I used to feel so when I had any music; I never have
any now except the organ at church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you long for it, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with
affectionate pity. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you can have very little that is beautiful in
your life. Have you many books? You were so fond of them when you were
a little girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were come back to the hollow, round which the dog-roses grew, and
they both paused under the charm of the faëry evening light, reflected
from the pale pink clusters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have given up books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``except a very,
very few.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip had already taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pocket a small volume, and was
looking at the back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, this is the second volume, I see, else you might have liked to
take it home with you. I put it in my pocket because I am studying a
scene for a picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had looked at the back too, and saw the title; it revived an
old impression with overmastering force.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`The Pirate,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, taking the book from Philip's hands. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I
began that once; I read to where Minna is walking with Cleveland, and
I could never get to read the rest. I went on with it in my own head,
and I made several endings; but they were all unhappy. I could never
make a happy ending out of that beginning. Poor Minna! I wonder what
is the real end. For a long while I couldn't get my mind away from the
Shetland Isles,--I used to feel the wind blowing on me from the rough
sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie spoke rapidly, with glistening eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take that volume home with you, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
with delight. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want it now. I shall make a picture of you
instead,--you, among the Scotch firs and the slanting shadows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had not heard a word he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had said; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was absorbed in a page at
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had opened. But suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) closed the book, and gave it
back to Philip, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head with a backward movement, as if to
say <div class="bookquote">``avaunt''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>to floating visions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do keep it, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, entreatingly; <div class="bookquote">``it will give you
pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, putting it aside with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand and
walking on. <div class="bookquote">``It would make me in love with this world again, as I used
to be; it would make me long to see and know many things; it would
make me long for a full life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will not always be shut up in your present lot; why should
you starve your mind in that way? It is narrow asceticism; I don't
like to see you persisting in it, Maggie. Poetry and art and knowledge
are sacred and pure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not for me, not for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, walking more hurriedly;
<div class="bookquote">``because I should want too much. I must wait; this life will not last
long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>``Don't hurry away from me without saying ``good-by,<div class="bookquote">'' Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Philip, as they reached the group of Scotch firs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued
still to walk along without speaking. <div class="bookquote">``I must not go any farther, I
think, must I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I forgot; good-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, pausing, and putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). The action brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feeling back in a strong current
to Philip; and after they had stood looking at each other in silence
for a few moments, with their hands clasped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very grateful to you for thinking of me all those years. It is
very sweet to have people love us. What a wonderful, beautiful thing
it seems that God should have made your heart so that you could care
about a queer little girl whom you only knew for a few weeks! I
remember saying to you that I thought you cared for me more than Tom
did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, almost fretfully, <div class="bookquote">``you would never love me
so well as you love your brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, simply; <div class="bookquote">``but then, you know, the first
thing I ever remember in my life is standing with Tom by the side of
the Floss, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held my hand; everything before that is dark to
me. But I shall never forget you, though we must keep apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say so, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``If I kept that little girl in my
mind for five years, didn't I earn some part in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ought not to
take herself quite away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I were free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``but I am not, I must submit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hesitated a moment, and then added, <div class="bookquote">``And I wanted to say to you, that
you had better not take more notice of my brother than just bowing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) once told me not to speak to you again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) doesn't change
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mind--Oh dear, the sun is set. I am too long away. Good-by.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come here as often as I can till I see you again, Maggie.
Have some feeling for _me_ as well as for others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, hurrying away, and quickly
disappearing behind the last fir-tree; though Philip's gaze after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
remained immovable for minutes as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) still.

<p/>Maggie went home, with an inward conflict already begun; Philip went
home to do nothing but remember and hope. You can hardly help blaming
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) severely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was four or five years older than Maggie, and had a
full consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feeling toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in foreseeing
the character his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) contemplated interviews with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would bear in the
opinion of a third person. But you must not suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was
capable of a gross selfishness, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could have been satisfied
without persuading himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was seeking to infuse some
happiness into Maggie's life,--seeking this even more than any direct
ends for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sympathy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) help.
There was not the slightest promise of love toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) manner;
it was nothing more than the sweet girlish tenderness she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had shown
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was twelve. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would never love him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); perhaps no
woman ever _could_ love him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would endure that; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
should at least have the happiness of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), of feeling some
nearness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) clutched passionately the possibility that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
_might_ love him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); perhaps the feeling would grow, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could come to
associate him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with that watchful tenderness which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nature would be
so keenly alive to. If any woman could love him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), surely Maggie was
that woman; there was such wealth of love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and there was no one
to claim it all. Then, the pity of it, that a mind like hers should be
withering in its very youth, like a young forest-tree, for want of the
light and space it was formed to flourish in! Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not hinder
that, by persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) system of privation? He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guardian angel; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would do anything, bear anything, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
sake--except not seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).



<p/>Chapter II

<p/>Aunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob's Thumb


<p/>While Maggie's life-struggles had lain almost entirely within her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
soul, one shadowy army fighting another, and the slain shadows forever
rising again, Tom was engaged in a dustier, noisier warfare, grappling
with more substantial obstacles, and gaining more definite conquests.
So it has been since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of
horses; inside the gates, the women with streaming hair and uplifted
hands offering prayers, watching the world's combat from afar, filling
their long, empty days with memories and fears; outside, the men, in
fierce struggle with things divine and human, quenching memory in the
stronger light of purpose, losing the sense of dread and even of
wounds in the hurrying ardor of action.

<p/>From what you have seen of Tom, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not a youth of whom you
would prophesy failure in anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had thoroughly wished; the
wagers are likely to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) small success
in the classics. For Tom had never desired success in this field of
enterprise; and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity
there is nothing like pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects
in which it feels no interest. But now Tom's strong will bound
together his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) integrity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pride, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) family regrets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
personal ambition, and made them one force, concentrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) efforts
and surmounting discouragements. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Deane, who watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
closely, soon began to conceive hopes of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>), and to be rather proud
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who
appeared to be made of such good commercial stuff. The real kindness
of placing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) in the warehouse first was soon evident to Tom, in the
hints his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle began to throw out, that after a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might perhaps
be trusted to travel at certain seasons, and buy in for the firm
various vulgar commodities with which I need not shock refined ears in
this place; and it was doubtless with a view to this result that Mr.
Deane, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) expected to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) wine alone, would tell Tom to step
in and sit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) an hour, and would pass that hour in much
lecturing and catechising concerning articles of export and import,
with an occasional excursus of more indirect utility on the relative
advantages to the merchants of St. Ogg's of having goods brought in
their own and in foreign bottoms,--a subject on which Mr. Deane, as a
ship-owner, naturally threw off a few sparks when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) got warmed with
talk and wine.

<p/>Already, in the second year, Tom's salary was raised; but all, except
the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dinner and clothes, went home into the tin box; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shunned comradeship, lest it should lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) into expenses in spite
of himself. Not that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the
Industrious Apprentice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a very strong appetite for
pleasure,--would have liked to be a Tamer of horses and to make a
distinguished figure in all neighboring eyes, dispensing treats and
benefits to others with well-judged liberality, and being pronounced
one of the finest young fellows of those parts; nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) determined to
achieve these things sooner or later; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) practical shrewdness
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that the means no such achievements could only lie for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in
present abstinence and self-denial; there were certain milestones to
be passed, and one of the first was the payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's debts.
Having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind on that point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strode along without
swerving, contracting some rather saturnine sternness, as a young man
is likely to do who has a premature call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for self-reliance.
Tom felt intensely that common cause with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father which springs
from family pride, and was bent on being irreproachable as a son; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) growing experience caused him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to pass much silent criticism on the
rashness and imprudence of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's past conduct; their
dispositions were not in sympathy, and Tom's face showed little
radiance during his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) few home hours. Maggie had an awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), against
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) struggled as something unfair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consciousness of wider
thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no use to struggle. A
character at unity with itself--that performs what it intends, subdues
every counteracting impulse, and has no visions beyond the distinctly
possible--is strong by its very negations.

<p/>You may imagine that Tom's more and more obvious unlikeness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles;
and Mr. Deane's favorable reports and predictions to Mr. Glegg
concerning Tom's qualifications for business began to be discussed
amongst them with various acceptance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was likely, it appeared, to
do the family credit without causing it any expense and trouble. Mrs.
Pullet had always thought it strange if Tom's excellent complexion, so
entirely that of the Dodsons, did not argue a certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would
turn out well; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) juvenile errors of running down the peacock, and
general disrespect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunts, only indicating a tinge of Tulliver
blood which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had doubtless outgrown. Mr. Glegg, who had contracted a
cautious liking for Tom ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spirited and sensible behavior
when the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution
to further his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prospects actively,--some time, when an opportunity
offered of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but
Mrs. Glegg observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) was not given to speak without book, as
some people were; that those who said least were most likely to find
their words made good; and that when the right moment came, it would
be seen who could do something better than talk. Uncle Pullet, after
silent meditation for a period of several lozenges, came distinctly to
the conclusion, that when a young man was likely to do well, it was
better not to meddle with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but
himself, though, with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications
of favorable opinion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was glad to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Glegg look in on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sometimes in a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be
invited to dine at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) house, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) usually preferred declining on
the ground that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not sure of being punctual. But about a year
ago, something had occurred which induced Tom to test his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle
Glegg's friendly disposition.

<p/>Bob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) rounds without seeing
Tom and Maggie, awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on the bridge as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was coming home from
St. Ogg's one evening, that they might have a little private talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
took the liberty of asking if Mr. Tom had ever thought of making money
by trading a bit on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own account. Trading, how? Tom wished to know.
Why, by sending out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports; because Bob had
a particular friend who had offered to do a little business for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) in
that way in Laceham goods, and would be glad to serve Mr. Tom on the
same footing. Tom was interested at once, and begged for full
explanation, wondering he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not thought of this plan before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might
change the slow process of addition into multiplication, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at
once determined to mention the matter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, and get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
consent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the
purchase of a small cargo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would rather not have consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had just paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) last quarter's money into the tin
box, and there was no other resource. All the savings were there; for
Mr. Tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should lose it. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had speculated in the purchase of some
corn, and had lost by it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) could not be easy without keeping the
money under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Tom approached the subject carefully, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was seated on the hearth
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father that evening, and Mr. Tulliver listened, leaning
forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) arm-chair and looking up in Tom's face with a sceptical
glance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
in some awe of Tom's wishes, and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had the sense of being an
<div class="bookquote">``unlucky''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had lost some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old peremptoriness and
determination to be master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took the key of the bureau from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
pocket, got out the key of the large chest, and fetched down the tin
box,--slowly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were trying to defer the moment of a painful
parting. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seated himself against the table, and opened the box
with that little padlock-key which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fingered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waistcoat pocket
in all vacant moments. There they were, the dingy bank-notes and the
bright sovereigns, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) counted them out on the table--only a
hundred and sixteen pounds in two years, after all the pinching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do you want, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, speaking as if the words burnt
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I begin with the thirty-six pounds, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand
over it, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as much as I can save out o' my pay in a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father; it is such slow work, saving out of the little money we
get. And in this way we might double our savings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand on the money, <div class="bookquote">``but you
might lose it,--you might lose a year o' my life,--and I haven't got
many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know I wouldn't pay a dividend with the first hundred,
because I wanted to see it all in a lump,--and when I see it, I'm sure
on't. If you trust to luck, it's sure to be against me. It's Old
Harry's got the luck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands; and if I lose one year, I shall
never pick it up again; death `ull o'ertake me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver's voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give it up, father, since you object to it so strongly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) determined to ask
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle Glegg to venture twenty pounds, on condition of receiving
five per cent. of the profits. That was really a very small thing to
ask. So when Bob called the next day at the wharf to know the
decision, Tom proposed that they should go together to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle
Glegg's to open the business; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) diffident pride clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feel that Bobs' tongue would relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from some
embarrassment.

<p/>Mr. Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot
August day, was naturally counting his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wall-fruit to assure himself
that the sum total had not varied since yesterday. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) entered Tom,
in what appeared to Mr. Glegg very questionable companionship,--that
of a man with a pack on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back,--for Bob was equipped for a new
journey,--and of a huge brindled bull-terrier, who walked with a slow,
swaying movement from side to side, and glanced from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
eye-lids with a surly indifference which might after all be a cover to
the most offensive designs.

<p/>Mr. Glegg's spectacles, which had been assisting him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) in counting the
fruit, made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heigh! heigh! keep that dog back, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) shouted, snatching up
a stake and holding it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) as a shield when the visitors were
within three yards of him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out wi' you, Mumps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, with a kick. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s as quiet as a
lamb, sir,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--an observation which Mumps corroborated by a low growl as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) retreated behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) master's legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what ever does this mean, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``Have you
brought information about the scoundrels as cut my trees?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>If Bob came
in the character of <div class="bookquote">``information,''  (<font color='red'><b>the character</b></font>)</div>Mr. Glegg saw reasons for
tolerating some irregularity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``I came to speak to you about a little matter of
business of my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--well; but what has this dog got to do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old
gentleman, getting mild again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my dog, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said the ready Bob. <div class="bookquote">``An' it's me as put Mr. Tom up
to the bit o' business; for Mr. Tom's been a friend o' mine iver since
I was a little chap; fust thing iver I did was frightenin' the birds
for th' old master. An' if a bit o' luck turns up, I'm allays thinkin'
if I can let Mr. Tom have a pull at it. An' it's a downright roarin'
shame, as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s got the chance o' making a bit o' money wi'
sending goods out,--ten or twelve per zent clear, when freight an'
commission's paid,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shouldn't lay hold o' the chance for want o'
money. An' when there's the Laceham goods,--lors! they're made o'
purpose for folks as want to send out a little carguy; light, an' take
up no room,--you may pack twenty pound so as you can't see the
passill; an' they're manifacturs as please fools, so I reckon they
aren't like to want a market. An' I'd go to Laceham an' buy in the
goods for Mr. Tom along wi' my own. An' there's the shupercargo o' the
bit of a vessel as is goin' to take 'em out. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) partic`lar;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a solid man, an' got a family i' the town here. Salt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name
is,--an' a briny chap he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is too,--an' if you don't believe me, I can
take you to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Glegg stood open-mouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed
loquacity, with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) understanding could hardly keep pace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
looked at Bob, first over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) spectacles, then through them, then over
them again; while Tom, doubtful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle's impression, began to
wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not brought this singular Aaron, or mouthpiece. Bob's talk
appeared less seemly, now some one besides himself was listening to
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to be a knowing fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sir, you say true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>returned Bob, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head aside; ``I
think my head's all alive inside like an old cheese, for I'm so full
o' plans, one knocks another over. If I hadn't Mumps to talk to, I
should get top-heavy an' tumble in a fit. I suppose it's because I
niver went to school much. That's what I jaw my old mother for. I
says, ``You should ha' sent me to school a bit more,<div class="bookquote">'' I says, `an' then
I could ha' read i' the books like fun, an' kep' my head cool an'
empty.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Lors, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s fine an' comfor`ble now, my old mother is; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
ates her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) baked meat an' taters as often as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) likes. For I'm gettin'
so full o' money, I must hev a wife to spend it for me. But it's
botherin,<div class="bookquote">'' a wife is,--and Mumps mightn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Glegg, who regarded himself as a jocose man since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had retired
from business, was beginning to find Bob amusing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had still a
disapproving observation to make, which kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) face serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I should think you're at a loss for ways o' spending
your money, else you wouldn't keep that big dog, to eat as much as two
Christians. It's shameful--shameful!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) spoke more in sorrow than
in anger, and quickly added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, come now, let's hear more about this business, Tom. I suppose
you want a little sum to make a venture with. But where's all your own
money? You don't spend it all--eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, coloring; <div class="bookquote">``but my father is unwilling to risk it,
and I don't like to press him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). If I could get twenty or thirty pounds
to begin with, I could pay five per cent for it, and then I could
gradually make a little capital of my own, and do without a loan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, in an approving tone; <div class="bookquote">``that's not a bad
notion, and I won't say as I wouldn't be your man. But it `ull be as
well for me to see this Salt, as you talk on. And then--here's this
friend o' yours offers to buy the goods for you. Perhaps you've got
somebody to stand surety for you if the money's put into your hands?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>added the cautious old gentleman, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) spectacles at Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that's necessary, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``At least, I mean
it would not be necessary for me, because I know Bob well; but perhaps
it would be right for you to have some security.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Glegg, looking at Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, rather indignantly; <div class="bookquote">``I didn't offer to get a
apple for Mr. Tom, o' purpose to hev a bite out of it myself. When I
play folks tricks, there'll be more fun in 'em nor that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but it's nothing but right you should have a small percentage,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``I've no opinion o' transactions where folks do things
for nothing. It allays looks bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, whose keenness saw at once what was implied,
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I get by`t, an' it's money in my pocket in the
end,--I make myself look big, wi' makin' a bigger purchase. That's
what I'm thinking on. Lors! I'm a `cute chap,--I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg, Mr. Glegg!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a severe voice from the open parlor
window, <div class="bookquote">``pray are you coming in to tea, or are you going to stand
talking with packmen till you get murdered in the open daylight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Murdered?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg; <div class="bookquote">``what's the woman talking of? Here's your
nephey Tom come about a bit o' business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Murdered,--yes,--it isn't many `sizes ago since a packman murdered a
young woman in a lone place, and stole her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thimble, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body
into a ditch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``you're thinking o' the man
wi' no legs, as drove a dog-cart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's the same thing, Mr. Glegg, only you're fond o'
contradicting what I say; and if my nephey's come about business, it
`ud be more fitting if you'd bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) into the house, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
aunt know about it, instead o' whispering in corners, in that
plotting, underminding way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``we'll come in now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady to Bob, in a loud voice,
adapted to the moral, not the physical, distance between them. <div class="bookquote">``We
don't want anything. I don't deal wi' packmen. Mind you shut the gate
after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit; not so fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg; <div class="bookquote">``I haven't done with this
young man yet. Come in, Tom; come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) added, stepping in at the
French window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. G., in a fatal tone, <div class="bookquote">``if you're going to let
that man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) dog in on my carpet, before my very face, be so good
as to let me know. A wife's got a right to ask that, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be uneasy, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) cap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) saw at once
that Mrs. Glegg was a bit of game worth running down, and longed to be
at the sport; <div class="bookquote">``we'll stay out upo' the gravel here,--Mumps and me
will. Mumps knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) company,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) does. I might hish at him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) by th'
hour together, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'d fly at a real gentlewoman like you. It's
wonderful how he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) knows which is the good-looking ladies; and's
partic`lar fond of 'em when they've good shapes. Lors!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>added Bob,
laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pack on the gravel, <div class="bookquote">``it's a thousand pities such a

ornamental stoppers, an' all got to get their dinner out of a bit o'
calico; it stan's to reason you must pay three times the price you pay
a packman, as is the nat`ral way o' gettin' goods,--an' pays no rent,
an' isn't forced to throttle himself till the lies are squeezed out on
him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) will or no. But lors! mum, you know what it is better

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I reckon I can, and through the packmen too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs.

on _her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>);_ while her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) husband, standing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)

probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's being circumvented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, to be sure, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you must ha' dealt wi' no end
o' packmen when you war a young lass--before the master here had the
luck to set eyes on you. I know where you lived, I do,--seen th' house

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that it had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, pouring out the tea. <div class="bookquote">``You know

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look you there now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, evasively. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't I know as you'd
remember the best bargains you've made in your life was made wi'
packmen? Why, you see even a squintin' packman's better nor a shopman
as can see straight. Lors! if I'd had the luck to call at the stone
house wi' my pack, as lies here,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--stooping and thumping the bundle
emphatically with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) fist,--<div class="bookquote">``an' th' handsome young lasses all
stannin' out on the stone steps, it ud' ha' been summat like openin' a
pack, that would. It's on'y the poor houses now as a packman calls on,
if it isn't for the sake o' the sarvant-maids. They're paltry times,
these are. Why, mum, look at the printed cottons now, an' what they
was when you wore 'em,--why, you wouldn't put such a thing on now, I
can see. It must be first-rate quality, the manifactur as you'd
buy,--summat as `ud wear as well as your own faitures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, better quality nor any you're like to carry; you've got nothing
first-rate but brazenness, I'll be bound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, with a
triumphant sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) insurmountable sagacity. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg, are you
going ever to sit down to your tea? Tom, there's a cup for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak true there, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``My pack isn't for ladies like
you. The time's gone by for that. Bargains picked up dirt cheap! A bit
o' damage here an' there, as can be cut out, or else niver seen i' the
wearin', but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look o'
things as nobody sees. I'm not the man as `ud offer t' open my pack to
_you_, mum; no, no; I'm a imperent chap, as you say,--these times
makes folks imperent,--but I'm not up to the mark o' that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what goods do you carry in your pack?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine-colored things, I suppose,--shawls an' that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All sorts, mum, all sorts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob,--thumping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bundle; <div class="bookquote">``but let
us say no more about that, if _you_ please. I'm here upo' Mr. Tom's

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray, what _is_ this business as is to be kept from me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Glegg, who, solicited by a double curiosity, was obliged to let
the one-half wait.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little plan o' nephey Tom's here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said good-natured Mr. Glegg;
<div class="bookquote">``and not altogether a bad `un, I think. A little plan for making
money; that's the right sort o' plan for young folks as have got their
fortin to make, eh, Jane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope it isn't a plan where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) expects iverything to be done for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friends; that's what the young folks think of mostly
nowadays. And pray, what has this packman got to do wi' what goes on
in our family? Can't you speak for yourself, Tom, and let your aunt
know things, as a nephey should?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Bob Jakin, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, bridling the irritation that aunt
Glegg's voice always produced. <div class="bookquote">``I've known him (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) ever since we were
little boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>)'s a very good fellow, and always ready to do me a
kindness. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) has had some experience in sending goods out,--a
small part of a cargo as a private speculation; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) thinks if I
could begin to do a little in the same way, I might make some money. A
large interest is got in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Large int`rest?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Glegg, with eagerness; <div class="bookquote">``and what do you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why wasn't I let to know o' such things before, Mr. Glegg?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Glegg, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) husband, with a deep grating tone of
reproach. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you allays told me as there was no getting more nor
five per cent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh, nonsense, my good woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``You couldn't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can turn a bit o' money for you, an' welcome, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob,
<div class="bookquote">``if you'd like to risk it,--not as there's any risk to speak on. But
if you'd a mind to lend a bit o' money to Mr. Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d pay you six or

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Mrs. G.?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``I've a notion, when I've

of a nest-egg,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll pay me int`rest, you know,--an' if you've got
some little sums lyin' idle twisted up in a stockin' toe, or that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg, it's beyond iverything! You'll go and give information to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, as I was sayin', if you like to join me wi' twenty

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not counting on me, Mr. Glegg, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``You
could do fine things wi' my money, I don't doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, rather snappishly, <div class="bookquote">``then we'll do without
you. I shall go with you to see this Salt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) added, turning to Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, I suppose, you'll go all the other way, Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. G., <div class="bookquote">``and want to shut me out o' my own nephey's business. I never

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that's a pleasant sort o'risk, that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg,
indiscreetly winking at Tom, who couldn't avoid smiling. But Bob
stemmed the injured lady's outburst.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said admiringly, <div class="bookquote">``you know what's what--you do. An' it's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got a bit of good net, now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, in a

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, mum, not what you'd think it worth your while to look at. I'd
scorn to show it you. It `ud be an insult to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, still patronizing. <div class="bookquote">``If they're

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mum, I know my place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pack and
shouldering it. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going t' expose the lowness o' my trade to a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All in good time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, really unwilling to cut short the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I left Stowe in my place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, put down your pack, and let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, drawing a
chair to the window and seating herself with much dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you ask it, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, entreatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make no more words,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, severely, <div class="bookquote">``but do as I tell

the step, and beginning to untie it with unwilling fingers. <div class="bookquote">``But what

junketing to 'em when they see me wi' my pack, an' I shall niver pick
up such bargains for 'em again. Least ways, I've no time now, for I'm
off to Laceham. See here now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>Bob went on, becoming rapid again, and
holding up a scarlet woollen Kerchief with an embroidered wreath in
the corner; <div class="bookquote">``here's a thing to make a lass's mouth water, an' on'y two
shillin'--an' why? Why, 'cause there's a bit of a moth-hole 'i this
plain end. Lors, I think the moths an' the mildew was sent by
Providence o' purpose to cheapen the goods a bit for the good-lookin'
women as han't got much money. If it hadn't been for the moths, now,
every hankicher on 'em `ud ha' gone to the rich, handsome ladies, like
you, mum, at five shillin' apiece,--not a farthin' less; but what does
the moth do? Why, it nibbles off three shillin' o' the price i' no
time; an' then a packman like me can carry 't to the poor lasses as
live under the dark thack, to make a bit of a blaze for 'em. Lors,
it's as good as a fire, to look at such a hankicher!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob held it at a distance for admiration, but Mrs. Glegg said sharply:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but nobody wants a fire this time o' year. Put these colored

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, mum, I told you how it `ud be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, flinging aside the
colored things with an air of desperation. <div class="bookquote">``I knowed it ud' turn
again' you to look at such paltry articles as I carry. Here's a piece
o' figured muslin now, what's the use o' you lookin' at it? You might
as well look at poor folks's victual, mum; it `ud on'y take away your
appetite. There's a yard i' the middle on't as the pattern's all
missed,--lors, why, it's a muslin as the Princess Victoree might ha'
wore; but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>added Bob, flinging it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) on to the turf, as if to
save Mrs. Glegg's eyes, <div class="bookquote">``it'll be bought up by the huckster's wife at
Fibb's End,--that's where _it'll_ go--ten shillin' for the whole
lot--ten yards, countin' the damaged un--five-an'-twenty shillin' `ud
ha' been the price, not a penny less. But I'll say no more, mum; it's
nothing to you, a piece o' muslin like that; you can afford to pay
three times the money for a thing as isn't half so good. It's nets

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring me that muslin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``It's a buff; I'm partial to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, but a _damaged_ thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, in a tone of deprecating
disgust. <div class="bookquote">``You'd do nothing with it, mum, you'd give it to the cook, I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch it, and let me see you measure it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg,
authoritatively.

<p/>Bob obeyed with ostentatious reluctance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See what there is over measure!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, holding forth the extra
half-yard, while Mrs. Glegg was busy examining the damaged yard, and
throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) head back to see how far the fault would be lost on a
distant view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you six shilling for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, throwing it down with
the air of a person who mentions an ultimatum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell you now, mum, as it `ud hurt your feelings to look at
my pack? That damaged bit's turned your stomach now; I see it has,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, wrapping the muslin up with the utmost quickness, and
apparently about to fasten up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pack. <div class="bookquote">``You're used to seein' a
different sort o' article carried by packmen, when you lived at the

goods are for common folks. Mrs. Pepper `ull give me ten shillin' for
that muslin, an' be sorry as I didn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) more. Such articles
answer i' the wearin',--they keep their color till the threads melt
away i' the wash-tub, an' that won't be while _I'm_ a young un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, seven shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it out o' your mind, mum, now do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a bit o'
net, then, for you to look at before I tie up my pack, just for you to

ha' bought such net, if it hadn't been yallow. Lors, it's took me a
deal o' study to know the vally o' such articles; when I begun to
carry a pack, I was as ignirant as a pig; net or calico was all the
same to me. I thought them things the most vally as was the thickest.
I was took in dreadful, for I'm a straightforrard chap,--up to no

should lose myself pretty quick. An' I gev five-an'-eightpence for
that piece o' net,--if I was to tell y' anything else I should be
tellin' you fibs,--an' five-an'-eightpence I shall ask of it, not a
penny more, for it's a woman's article, an' I like to `commodate the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind having three yards of it,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!, see what a pattern now! Real Laceham goods. Now, this is the

<div class="bookquote">``you never _will_ give me the chance o' speaking. You'll go away now,
and finish everything about this business, and come back and tell me
it's too late for me to speak. As if I wasn't my nephey's own aunt,
and the head o' the family on his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) mother's side! and laid by guineas,
all full weight, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'ll know who to respect when I'm laid
in my coffin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. G., say what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. G., hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I desire as nothing may be done without my knowing. I
don't say as I sha'n't venture twenty pounds, if you make out as
everything's right and safe. And if I do, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>concluded Mrs. Glegg,
turning impressively to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) nephew, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll allays bear it in
mind and be grateful for such an aunt. I mean you to pay me interest,
you know; I don't approve o' giving; we niver looked for that in _my_
family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, rather proudly. <div class="bookquote">``I prefer having the
money only lent to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; that's the Dodson sperrit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, rising to get
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) knitting with the sense that any further remark after this would
be bathos.

<p/>Salt--that eminently <div class="bookquote">``briny chap'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>--having been discovered in a cloud
of tobacco-smoke at the Anchor Tavern, Mr. Glegg commenced inquiries
which turned out satisfactorily enough to warrant the advance of the
<div class="bookquote">``nest-egg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>to which aunt Glegg contributed twenty pounds; and in this
modest beginning you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise
surprise you; namely, Tom's accumulation of a fund, unknown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father, that promised in no very long time to meet the more tardy
process of saving, and quite cover the deficit. When once his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
attention had been turned to this source of gain, Tom determined to
make the most of it, and lost no opportunity of obtaining information
and extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) small enterprises. In not telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
influenced by that strange mixture of opposite feelings which often
gives equal truth to those who blame an action and those who admire
it,--partly, it was that disinclination to confidence which is seen
between near kindred, that family repulsion which spoils the most
sacred relations of our lives; partly, it was the desire to surprise
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father with a great joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not see that it would have been
better to soothe the interval with a new hope, and prevent the
delirium of a too sudden elation.

<p/>At the time of Maggie's first meeting with Philip, Tom had already
nearly a hundred and fifty pounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own capital; and while they
were walking by the evening light in the Red Deeps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), by the same
evening light, was riding into Laceham, proud of being on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first
journey on behalf of Guest & Co., and revolving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind all the
chances that by the end of another year he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should have doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
gains, lifted off the obloquy of debt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's name, and
perhaps--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should be twenty-one--have got a new start for
himself, on a higher platform of employment. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) not desire it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did.



<p/>Chapter III

<p/>The Wavering Balance


<p/>I said that Maggie went home that evening from the Red Deeps with a
mental conflict already begun. You have seen clearly enough, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
interview with Philip, what that conflict was. Here suddenly was an
opening in the rocky wall which shut in the narrow valley of
humiliation, where all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) prospect was the remote, unfathomed sky;
and some of the memory-haunting earthly delights were no longer out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have books, converse, affection; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might hear
tidings of the world from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind had not yet lost its sense of
exile; and it would be a kindness to Philip too, who was
pitiable,--clearly not happy. And perhaps here was an opportunity
indicated for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind more worthy of its highest service;
perhaps the noblest, completest devoutness could hardly exist without
some width of knowledge; _must_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) always live in this resigned
imprisonment? It was so blameless, so good a thing that there should
be friendship between her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and Philip; the motives that forbade it were
so unreasonable, so unchristian! But the severe monotonous warning
came again and again,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was losing the simplicity and
clearness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life by admitting a ground of concealment; and that,
by forsaking the simple rule of renunciation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was throwing herself
under the seductive guidance of illimitable wants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
won strength to obey the warning before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) allowed herself the next
week to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) steps in the evening to the Red Deeps. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was resolved to say an affectionate farewell to Philip, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked
forward to that evening walk in the still, fleckered shade of the
hollows, away from all that was harsh and unlovely; to the
affectionate, admiring looks that would meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); to the sense of
comradeship that childish memories would give to wiser, older talk; to
the certainty that Philip would care to hear everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said,
which no one else cared for! It was a half-hour that it would be very
hard to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) back upon, with the sense that there would be no
other like it. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meant to say; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked firm as
well as sad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Philip, I have made up my mind; it is right that we should give each
other up, in everything but memory. I could not see you without
concealment--stay, I know what you are going to say,--it is other
people's wrong feelings that make concealment necessary; but
concealment is bad, however it may be caused. I feel that it would be
bad for me, for us both. And then, if our secret were discovered,
there would be nothing but misery,--dreadful anger; and then we must
part after all, and it would be harder, when we were used to seeing
each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip's face had flushed, and there was a momentary eagerness of
expression, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been about to resist this decision with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) controlled himself, and said, with assumed calmness: <div class="bookquote">``Well,
Maggie, if we must part, let us try and forget it for one half hour;
let us talk together a little while, for the last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand, and Maggie felt no reason to withdraw it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
quietness made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) all the more sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) great pain, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) how unwillingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had given it. They walked
together hand in hand in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us sit down in the hollow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, <div class="bookquote">``where we stood the last
time. See how the dog-roses have strewed the ground, and spread their
opal petals over it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat down at the roots of the slanting ash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've begun my picture of you among the Scotch firs, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Philip, <div class="bookquote">``so you must let me study your face a little, while you
stay,--since I am not to see it again. Please turn your head this
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>This was said in an entreating voice, and it would have been very hard
of Maggie to refuse. The full, lustrous face, with the bright black
coronet, looked down like that of a divinity well pleased to be
worshipped, on the pale-hued, small-featured face that was turned up
to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be sitting for my second portrait then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``Will it be larger than the other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, much larger. It is an oil-painting. You will look like a tall
Hamadryad, dark and strong and noble, just issued from one of the
fir-trees, when the stems are casting their afternoon shadows on the
grass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to think more of painting than of anything now, Philip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, rather sadly; <div class="bookquote">``but I think of too many
things,--sow all sorts of seeds, and get no great harvest from any one
of them. I'm cursed with susceptibility in every direction, and
effective faculty in none. I care for painting and music; I care for
classic literature, and mediæval literature, and modern literature; I
flutter all ways, and fly in none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely that is a happiness to have so many tastes,--to enjoy so
many beautiful things, when they are within your reach,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
musingly. <div class="bookquote">``It always seemed to me a sort of clever stupidity only to
have one sort of talent,--almost like a carrier-pigeon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might be a happiness to have many tastes if I were like other
men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``I might get some power and distinction
by mere mediocrity, as they do; at least I should get those middling
satisfactions which make men contented to do without great ones. I
might think society at St. Ogg's agreeable then. But nothing could
make life worth the purchase-money of pain to me, but some faculty
that would lift me above the dead level of provincial existence. Yes,
there is one thing,--a passion answers as well as a faculty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie did not hear the last words; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was struggling against the
consciousness that Philip's words had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own discontent vibrating
again as it used to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``though I know so much less
than you do. I used to think I could never bear life if it kept on
being the same every day, and I must always be doing things of no
consequence, and never know anything greater. But, dear Philip, I
think we are only like children that some one who is wiser is taking
care of. Is it not right to resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be
denied us? I have found great peace in that for the last two or three
years, even joy in subduing my own will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, vehemently; <div class="bookquote">``and you are shutting yourself
up in a narrow, self-delusive fanaticism, which is only a way of
escaping pain by starving into dulness all the highest powers of your
nature. Joy and peace are not resignation; resignation is the willing
endurance of a pain that is not allayed, that you don't expect to be
allayed. Stupefaction is not resignation; and it is stupefaction to
remain in ignorance,--to shut up all the avenues by which the life of
your fellow-men might become known to you. I am not resigned; I am not
sure that life is long enough to learn that lesson. _You_ are not
resigned; you are only trying to stupefy yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's lips trembled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt there was some truth in what Philip
said, and yet there was a deeper consciousness that, for any immediate
application it had to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conduct, it was no better than falsity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
double impression corresponded to the double impulse of the speaker.
Philip seriously believed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said it with vehemence
because it made an argument against the resolution that opposed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
wishes. But Maggie's face, made more childlike by the gathering tears,
touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with a tenderer, less egotistic feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand
and said gently:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us think of such things in this short half-hour, Maggie. Let
us only care about being together. We shall be friends in spite of
separation. We shall always think of each other. I shall be glad to
live as long as you are alive, because I shall think there may always
come a time when I can--when you will let me help you in some way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a dear, good brother you would have been, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
smiling through the haze of tears. <div class="bookquote">``I think you would have made as
much fuss about me, and been as pleased for me to love you, as would
have satisfied even me. You would have loved me well enough to bear
with me, and forgive me everything. That was what I always longed that
Tom should do. I was never satisfied with a _little_ of anything. That
is why it is better for me to do without earthly happiness altogether.
I never felt that I had enough music,--I wanted more instruments
playing together; I wanted voices to be fuller and deeper. Do you ever
sing now, Philip?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added abruptly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had forgotten what
went before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``every day, almost. But my voice is only middling,
like everything else in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sing me something,--just one song. I _may_ listen to that before
I go,--something you used to sing at Lorton on a Saturday afternoon,
when we had the drawing-room all to ourselves, and I put my apron over
my head to listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip; and Maggie buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sang _sotto voce_, <div class="bookquote">``Love in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes sits playing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then said,
<div class="bookquote">``That's it, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I won't stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, starting up. <div class="bookquote">``It will only haunt
me. Let us walk, Philip. I must go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moved away, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was obliged to rise and follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, in a tone of remonstrance, <div class="bookquote">``don't persist in this
wilful, senseless privation. It makes me wretched to see you benumbing
and cramping your nature in this way. You were so full of life when
you were a child; I thought you would be a brilliant woman,--all wit
and bright imagination. And it flashes out in your face still, until
you draw that veil of dull quiescence over it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you speak so bitterly to me, Philip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I foresee it will not end well; you can never carry on this
self-torture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have strength given me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, tremulously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you will not, Maggie; no one has strength given to do what is
unnatural. It is mere cowardice to seek safety in negations. No
character becomes strong in that way. You will be thrown into the
world some day, and then every rational satisfaction of your nature
that you deny now will assault you like a savage appetite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie started and paused, looking at Philip with alarm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Philip, how dare you shake me in this way? You are a tempter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not; but love gives insight, Maggie, and insight often gives
foreboding. _Listen_ to me,--let _me_ supply you with books; do let me
see you sometimes,--be your brother and teacher, as you said at
Lorton. It is less wrong that you should see me than that you should
be committing this long suicide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie felt unable to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head and walked on in
silence, till they came to the end of the Scotch firs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand in sign of parting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you banish me from this place forever, then, Maggie? Surely I may
come and walk in it sometimes? If I meet you by chance, there is no
concealment in that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It is the moment when our resolution seems about to become
irrevocable--when the fatal iron gates are about to close upon
us--that tests our strength. Then, after hours of clear reasoning and
firm conviction, we snatch at any sophistry that will nullify our long
struggles, and bring us the defeat that we love better than victory.

<p/>Maggie felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart leap at this subterfuge of Philip's, and there
passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face that almost imperceptible shock which accompanies
any relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw it, and they parted in silence.

<p/>Philip's sense of the situation was too complete for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not to be
visited with glancing fears lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been intervening too
presumptuously in the action of Maggie's conscience, perhaps for a
selfish end. But no!--he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) persuaded himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) end was not selfish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had little hope that Maggie would ever return the strong feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and it must be better for Maggie's future life, when
these petty family obstacles to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) freedom had disappeared, that the
present should not be entirely sacrificed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have
some opportunity of culture,--some interchange with a mind above the
vulgar level of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was now condemned to live with. If we only
look far enough off for the consequence of our actions, we can always
find some point in the combination of results by which those actions
can be justified; by adopting the point of view of a Providence who
arranges results, or of a philosopher who traces them, we shall find
it possible to obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do what is
most agreeable to us in the present moment. And it was in this way
that Philip justified his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) subtle efforts to overcome Maggie's true
prompting against a concealment that would introduce doubleness into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own mind, and might cause new misery to those who had the primary
natural claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But there was a surplus of passion in him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) half independent of justifying motives. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) longing to see
Maggie, and make an element in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life, had in it some of that savage
impulse to snatch an offered joy which springs from a life in which
the mental and bodily constitution have made pain predominate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) full share in the common good of men; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not even pass
muster with the insignificant, but must be singled out for pity, and
excepted from what was a matter of course with others. Even to Maggie
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was an exception; it was clear that the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) being her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
lover had never entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Do not think too hardly of Philip. Ugly and deformed people have great
need of unusual virtues, because they are likely to be extremely
uncomfortable without them; but the theory that unusual virtues spring
by a direct consequence out of personal disadvantages, as animals get
thicker wool in severe climates, is perhaps a little overstrained. The
temptations of beauty are much dwelt upon, but I fancy they only bear
the same relation to those of ugliness, as the temptation to excess at
a feast, where the delights are varied for eye and ear as well as
palate, bears to the temptations that assail the desperation of
hunger. Does not the Hunger Tower stand as the type of the utmost
trial to what is human in us?

<p/>Philip had never been soothed by that mother's love which flows out to
us in the greater abundance because our need is greater, which clings
to us the more tenderly because we are the less likely to be winners
in the game of life; and the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father's affection and
indulgence toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was marred by the keener perception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
father's faults. Kept aloof from all practical life as Philip had
been, and by nature half feminine in sensitiveness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had some of the
woman's intolerant repulsion toward worldliness and the deliberate
pursuit of sensual enjoyment; and this one strong natural tie in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
life,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) relation as a son,--was like an aching limb to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Perhaps
there is inevitably something morbid in a human being who is in any
way unfavorably excepted from ordinary conditions, until the good
force has had time to triumph; and it has rarely had time for that at
two-and-twenty. That force was present in Philip in much strength, but
the sun himself looks feeble through the morning mists.



<p/>Chapter IV

<p/>Another Love-Scene


<p/>Early in the following April, nearly a year after that dubious parting
you have just witnessed, you may, if you like, again see Maggie
entering the Red Deeps through the group of Scotch firs. But it is
early afternoon and not evening, and the edge of sharpness in the
spring air makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) large shawl close about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and trip
along rather quickly; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looks round, as usual, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) may
take in the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) beloved trees. There is a more eager,
inquiring look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes than there was last June, and a smile is
hovering about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips, as if some playful speech were awaiting the
right hearer. The hearer was not long in appearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take back your _Corinne_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, drawing a book from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
shawl. <div class="bookquote">``You were right in telling me she (<font color='blue'><b>Corinne</b></font>) would do me no good; but you
were wrong in thinking I should wish to be like her (<font color='blue'><b>Corinne</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you really like to be a tenth Muse, then, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Philip looking up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face as we look at a first parting in the
clouds that promises us a bright heaven once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``The Muses were uncomfortable
goddesses, I think,--obliged always to carry rolls and musical
instruments about with them. If I carried a harp in this climate, you
know, I must have a green baize cover for it; and I should be sure to
leave it behind me by mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You agree with me in not liking Corinne, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't finish the book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``As soon as I came to the
blond-haired young lady reading in the park, I shut it up, and
determined to read no further. I foresaw that that light-complexioned
girl would win away all the love from Corinne and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Corinne</b></font>) miserable.
I'm determined to read no more books where the blond-haired women
carry away all the happiness. I should begin to have a prejudice
against them. If you could give me some story, now, where the dark
woman triumphs, it would restore the balance. I want to avenge Rebecca
and Flora MacIvor and Minna, and all the rest of the dark unhappy
ones. Since you are my tutor, you ought to preserve my mind from
prejudices; you are always arguing against prejudices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person, and
carry away all the love from your cousin Lucy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is sure to have
some handsome young man of St. Ogg's at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet now; and you have
only to shine upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>)--your fair little cousin will be quite quenched
in your beams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Philip, that is not pretty of you, to apply my nonsense to anything
real,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking hurt. <div class="bookquote">``As if I, with my old gowns and want
of all accomplishments, could be a rival of dear little Lucy,--who
knows and does all sorts of charming things, and is ten times prettier
than I am,--even if I were odious and base enough to wish to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
rival. Besides, I never go to aunt Deane's when any one is there; it
is only because dear Lucy is good, and loves me, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) comes to see
me, and will have me go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, with surprise, <div class="bookquote">``it is not like you to take
playfulness literally. You must have been in St. Ogg's this morning,
and brought away a slight infection of dulness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``if you meant that for a joke, it was a
poor one; but I thought it was a very good reproof. I thought you
wanted to remind me that I am vain, and wish every one to admire me
most. But it isn't for that that I'm jealous for the dark women,--not
because I'm dark myself; it's because I always care the most about the
unhappy people. If the blond girl were forsaken, I should like _her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_
best. I always take the side of the rejected lover in the stories.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you would never have the heart to reject one yourself, should
you, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, flushing a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, hesitatingly. Then with a bright smile,
<div class="bookquote">``I think perhaps I could if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were very conceited; and yet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) got
extremely humiliated afterward, I should relent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've often wondered, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>Philip said, with some effort, <div class="bookquote">``whether
you wouldn't really be more likely to love a man that other women were
not likely to love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would depend on what they didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
laughing. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be very disagreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might look at me through
an eye-glass stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, making a hideous face, as young Torry
does. I should think other women are not fond of that; but I never
felt any pity for young Torry. I've never any pity for conceited
people, because I think they carry their comfort about with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose, Maggie,--suppose it was a man who was not conceited, who
felt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nothing to be conceited about; who had been marked from
childhood for a peculiar kind of suffering, and to whom you were the
day-star of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life; who loved you, worshipped you, so entirely that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt it happiness enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if you would let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see you at
rare moments--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip paused with a pang of dread lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confession should cut
short this very happiness,--a pang of the same dread that had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
love mute through long months. A rush of self-consciousness told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was besotted to have said all this. Maggie's manner this
morning had been as unconstrained and indifferent as ever.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not looking indifferent now. Struck with the unusual
emotion in Philip's tone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had turned quickly to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went on speaking, a great change came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face,--a flush
and slight spasm of the features, such as we see in people who hear
some news that will require them to readjust their conceptions of the
past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was quite silent, and walking on toward the trunk of a
fallen tree, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat down, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no strength to spare for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
muscles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, getting more and more alarmed in every fresh
moment of silence, <div class="bookquote">``I was a fool to say it; forget that I've said it.
I shall be contented if things can be as they were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>The distress with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke urged Maggie to say something. <div class="bookquote">``I am
so surprised, Philip; I had not thought of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the effort to say
this brought the tears down too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it made you hate me, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
think I'm a presumptuous fool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Philip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``how can you think I have such feelings? As
if I were not grateful for _any_ love. But--but I had never thought of
your being my lover. It seemed so far off--like a dream--only like one
of the stories one imagines--that I should ever have a lover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then can you bear to think of me as your lover, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip,
seating himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand, in the elation of a
sudden hope. <div class="bookquote">''_Do_ you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie turned rather pale; this direct question seemed not easy to
answer. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes met Philip's, which were in this moment liquid
and beautiful with beseeching love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke with hesitation, yet
with sweet, simple, girlish tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I could hardly love any one better; there is nothing but what
I love you for.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) paused a little while, and then added: <div class="bookquote">``But it
will be better for us not to say any more about it, won't it, dear
Philip? You know we couldn't even be friends, if our friendship were
discovered. I have never felt that I was right in giving way about
seeing you, though it has been so precious to me in some ways; and now
the fear comes upon me strongly again, that it will lead to evil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But no evil has come, Maggie; and if you had been guided by that fear
before, you would only have lived through another dreary, benumbing
year, instead of reviving into your real self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It has been very sweet, I know,--all the
talking together, and the books, and the feeling that I had the walk
to look forward to, when I could tell you the thoughts that had come
into my head while I was away from you. But it has made me restless;
it has made me think a great deal about the world; and I have
impatient thoughts again,--I get weary of my home; and then it cuts me
to the heart afterward, that I should ever have felt weary of my
father and mother. I think what you call being benumbed was
better--better for me--for then my selfish desires were benumbed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip had risen again, and was walking backward and forward
impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Maggie, you have wrong ideas of self-conquest, as I've often told
you. What you call self-conquest--binding and deafening yourself to
all but one train of impressions--is only the culture of monomania in
a nature like yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had spoken with some irritation, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) again
and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of the past now, Maggie; think only of our love. If you
can really cling to me with all your heart, every obstacle will be
overcome in time; we need only wait. I can live on hope. Look at me,
Maggie; tell me again it is possible for you to love me. Don't look
away from me to that cloven tree; it is a bad omen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) large dark glance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with a sad smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Maggie, say one kind word, or else you were better to me at
Lorton. You asked me if I should like you to kiss me,--don't you
remember?--and you promised to kiss me when you met me again. You
never kept the promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>The recollection of that childish time came as a sweet relief to
Maggie. It made the present moment less strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
almost as simply and quietly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was twelve years
old. Philip's eyes flashed with delight, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) next words were words
of discontent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem happy enough, Maggie; you are forcing yourself to say
you love me, out of pity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old childish way;
<div class="bookquote">``I'm telling you the truth. It is all new and strange to me; but I
don't think I could love any one better than I love you. I should like
always to live with you--to make you happy. I have always been happy
when I have been with you. There is only one thing I will not do for
your sake; I will never do anything to wound my father. You must never
ask that from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Maggie, I will ask nothing; I will bear everything; I'll wait
another year only for a kiss, if you will only give me the first place
in your heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I won't make you wait so long as that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>But then, looking serious again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
seat,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what would your own father say, Philip? Oh, it is quite
impossible we can ever be more than friends,--brother and sister in
secret, as we have been. Let us give up thinking of everything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Maggie, I can't give you up,--unless you are deceiving me; unless
you really only care for me as if I were your brother. Tell me the
truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do, Philip. What happiness have I ever had so great as being
with you,--since I was a little girl,--the days Tom was good to me?
And your mind is a sort of world to me; you can tell me all I want to
know. I think I should never be tired of being with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were walking hand in hand, looking at each other; Maggie, indeed,
was hurrying along, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt it time to be gone. But the sense
that their parting was near made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more anxious lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have
unintentionally left some painful impression on Philip's mind. It was
one of those dangerous moments when speech is at once sincere and
deceptive; when feeling, rising high above its average depth, leaves
floodmarks which are never reached again.

<p/>They stopped to part among the Scotch firs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then my life will be filled with hope, Maggie, and I shall be happier
than other men, in spite of all? We _do_ belong to each other--for
always--whether we are apart or together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Philip; I should like never to part; I should like to make your
life very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am waiting for something else. I wonder whether it will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie smiled, with glistening tears, and then stooped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tall head
to kiss the pale face that was full of pleading, timid love,--like a
woman's.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a moment of real happiness then,--a moment of belief that, if
there were sacrifice in this love, it was all the richer and more
satisfying.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned away and hurried home, feeling that in the hour since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had trodden this road before, a new era had begun for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The tissue
of vague dreams must now get narrower and narrower, and all the
threads of thought and emotion be gradually absorbed in the woof of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) actual daily life.



<p/>Chapter V

<p/>The Cloven Tree


<p/>Secrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme
our fear has sketched out. Fear is almost always haunted by terrible
dramatic scenes, which recur in spite of the best-argued probabilities
against them; and during a year that Maggie had had the burthen of
concealment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, the possibility of discovery had continually
presented itself under the form of a sudden meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father or
Tom when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was walking with Philip in the Red Deeps. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was aware
that this was not one of the most likely events; but it was the scene
that most completely symbolized her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inward dread. Those slight
indirect suggestions which are dependent on apparently trivial
coincidences and incalculable states of mind, are the favorite
machinery of Fact, but are not the stuff in which Imagination is apt
to work.

<p/>Certainly one of the persons about whom Maggie's fears were furthest
from troubling themselves was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Pullet, on whom, seeing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not live in St. Ogg's, and was neither sharp-eyed nor
sharp-tempered, it would surely have been quite whimsical of them to
fix rather than on aunt Glegg. And yet the channel of fatality--the
pathway of the lightning--was no other than aunt Pullet. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did not
live at St. Ogg's, but the road from Garum Firs lay by the Red Deeps,
at the end opposite that by which Maggie entered.

<p/>The day after Maggie's last meeting with Philip, being a Sunday on
which Mr. Pullet was bound to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at
St. Ogg's church, Mrs. Pullet made this the occasion of dining with
sister Glegg, and taking tea with poor sister Tulliver. Sunday was the
one day in the week on which Tom was at home in the afternoon; and
today the brighter spirits he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been in of late had flowed over in
unusually cheerful open chat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, and in the invitation,
<div class="bookquote">``Come, Magsie, you come too!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strolled out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother in
the garden to see the advancing cherry-blossoms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been better
pleased with Maggie since she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been less odd and ascetic; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
even getting rather proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); several persons had remarked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
hearing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister was a very fine girl. To-day there was a
peculiar brightness in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face, due in reality to an undercurrent of
excitement, which had as much doubt and pain as pleasure in it; but it
might pass for a sign of happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look very well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head
sadly, as they sat round the tea-table. <div class="bookquote">``I niver thought your girl `ud
be so good-looking, Bessy. But you must wear pink, my dear; that blue
thing as your aunt Glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower. Jane
never _was_ tasty. Why don't you wear that gown o' mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It is so pretty and so smart, aunt. I think it's too showy for
me,--at least for my other clothes, that I must wear with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, it `ud be unbecoming if it wasn't well known you've got
them belonging to you as can afford to give you such things when
they've done with 'em themselves. It stands to reason I must give my
own niece clothes now and then,--such things as _I_ buy every year,
and never wear anything out. And as for Lucy, there's no giving to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s got everything o' the choicest; sister Deane may well
hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head up,--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looks dreadful yallow, poor thing--I
doubt this liver complaint `ull carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) off. That's what this new
vicar, this Dr. Kenn, said in the funeral sermon to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)'s a wonderful preacher, by all account,--isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>), Sophy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Lucy had got a collar on this blessed day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs.
Pullet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes fixed in a ruminating manner, <div class="bookquote">``as I don't say I
haven't got as good, but I must look out my best to match it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lucy's called the bell o' St. Ogg's, they say; that's a cur`ous
word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Pullet, on whom the mysteries of etymology
sometimes fell with an oppressive weight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, jealous for Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s a small thing,
not much of a figure. But fine feathers make fine birds. I see nothing
to admire so much in those diminutive women; they look silly by the
side o' the men,--out o' proportion. When I chose my wife, I chose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
the right size,--neither too little nor too big.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor wife, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) withered beauty, smiled complacently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the men aren't _all_ big,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Pullet, not without some
self-reference; ``a young fellow may be good-looking and yet not be a
six-foot, like Master Tom here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's poor talking about littleness and bigness,--anybody may
think it's a mercy they're straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet. <div class="bookquote">``There's that
mismade son o' Lawyer Wakem's, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) at church to-day. Dear, dear!
to think o' the property he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s like to have; and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s very
queer and lonely, doesn't like much company. I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
goes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) mind; for we never come along the road but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s
a-scrambling out o' the trees and brambles at the Red Deeps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/>This wide statement, by which Mrs. Pullet represented the fact that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) had twice seen Philip at the spot indicated, produced an effect on
Maggie which was all the stronger because Tom sate opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was intensely anxious to look indifferent. At Philip's name she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had blushed, and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness,
until the mention of the Red Deeps made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feel as if the whole
secret were betrayed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dared not even hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tea-spoon lest
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should show how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) trembled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands clasped under
the table, not daring to look round. Happily, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father was seated on
the same side with herself, beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) uncle Pullet, and could not see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face without stooping forward. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's voice brought the
first relief, turning the conversation; for Mrs. Tulliver was always
alarmed when the name of Wakem was mentioned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) husband's
presence. Gradually Maggie recovered composure enough to look up; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
eyes met Tom's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head immediately; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went
to bed that night wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had gathered any suspicion from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
confusion. Perhaps not; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would think it was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) alarm
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt's mention of Wakem before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father; that was the
interpretation her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother had put in it. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, Wakem was like
a disfiguring disease, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was obliged to endure the
consciousness, but was exasperated to have the existence recognized by
others; and no amount of sensitiveness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father could
be surprising, Maggie thought.

<p/>But Tom was too keen-sighted to rest satisfied with such an
interpretation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had seen clearly enough that there was something
distinct from anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father in Maggie's excessive
confusion. In trying to recall all the details that could give shape
to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suspicions, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remembered only lately hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother scold
Maggie for walking in the Red Deeps when the ground was wet, and
bringing home shoes clogged with red soil; still Tom, retaining all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old repulsion for Philip's deformity, shrank from attributing to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister the probability of feeling more than a friendly interest in
such an unfortunate exception to the common run of men. Tom's was a
nature which had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything
exceptional. A love for a deformed man would be odious in any woman,
in a sister intolerable. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been carrying on any kind of
intercourse whatever with Philip, a stop must be put to it at once;
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was disobeying her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father's strongest feelings and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother's
express commands, besides compromising herself by secret meetings. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
left home the next morning in that watchful state of mind which turns
the most ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences.

<p/>That afternoon, about half-past three o'clock, Tom was standing on the
wharf, talking with Bob Jakin about the probability of the good ship
Adelaide coming in, in a day or two, with results highly important to
both of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, parenthetically, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) looked over the fields on the
other side of the river, <div class="bookquote">``there goes that crooked young Wakem. I know
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) shadder as far off as I can see 'em; I'm allays lighting on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) o' that side the river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A sudden thought seemed to have darted through Tom's mind. <div class="bookquote">``I must go,
Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I've something to attend to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>hurrying off to the
warehouse, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left notice for some one to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) place; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
called away home on peremptory business.

<p/>The swiftest pace and the shortest road took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the gate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was pausing to open it deliberately, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might walk into the house
with an appearance of perfect composure, when Maggie came out at the
front door in bonnet and shawl. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) conjecture was fulfilled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at the gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) started violently when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, how is it you are come home? Is there anything the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie spoke in a low, tremulous voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm come to walk with you to the Red Deeps, and meet Philip Wakem,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, the central fold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brow, which had become habitual with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), deepening as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>Maggie stood helpless, pale and cold. By some means, then, Tom knew
everything. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are; but I want to speak to you first. Where is my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out on horseback.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the yard, I think, with the poultry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can go in, then, without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seeing me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked in together, and Tom, entering the parlor, said to Maggie,
<div class="bookquote">``Come in here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) obeyed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) closed the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Maggie, tell me this instant everything that has passed between
you and Philip Wakem.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does my father know anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, still trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) _shall_ know, if you attempt to
use deceit toward me any further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to use deceit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, flushing into resentment at
hearing this word applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me the whole truth, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind whether I know it or not. Tell me exactly what has
happened, or my father shall know everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell it for my father's sake, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it becomes you to profess affection for your father, when you
have despised his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strongest feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never do wrong, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, tauntingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>answered Tom, with proud sincerity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have nothing to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed
between you and Philip Wakem. When did you first meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) in the Red
Deeps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A year ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, quietly. Tom's severity gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a certain
fund of defiance, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sense of error in abeyance. <div class="bookquote">``You need
ask me no more questions. We have been friendly a year. We have met
and walked together often. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) has lent me books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, looking straight at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) frown.

<p/>Maggie paused a moment; then, determined to make an end of Tom's right
to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of deceit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said haughtily:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not quite all. On Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) loved me. I didn't
think of it before then; I had only thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) as an old friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you _encouraged_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with an expression of disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) that I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was silent a few moments, looking on the ground and frowning, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked up and said coldly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, Maggie, there are but two courses for you to take,--either
you vow solemnly to me, with your hand on my father's Bible, that you
will never have another meeting or speak another word in private with
Philip Wakem, or you refuse, and I tell my father everything; and this
month, when by my exertions he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be made happy once more, you will
cause him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the blow of knowing that you are a disobedient, deceitful
daughter, who throws away her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own respectability by clandestine
meetings with the son of a man that has helped to ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father.
Choose!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Tom ended with cold decision, going up to the large Bible,
drawing it forward, and opening it at the fly-leaf, where the writing
was.

<p/>It was a crushing alternative to Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, urged out of pride into pleading, <div class="bookquote">``don't ask me that.
I will promise you to give up all intercourse with Philip, if you will
let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) once, or even only write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and explain
everything,--to give it up as long as it would ever cause any pain to
my father. I feel something for Philip too. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)_ is not happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to hear anything of your feelings; I have said exactly
what I mean. Choose, and quickly, lest my mother should come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I give you my word, that will be as strong a bond to me as if I
laid my hand on the Bible. I don't require that to bind me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do what _I_ require,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. ``I can't trust you, Maggie. There is
no consistency in you. Put your hand on this Bible, and say, ``I
renounce all private speech and intercourse with Philip Wakem from
this time forth.<div class="bookquote">'' Else you will bring shame on us all, and grief on my
father; and what is the use of my exerting myself and giving up
everything else for the sake of paying my father's debts, if you are
to bring madness and vexation on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), just when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be easy and
hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head once more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tom, _will_ the debts be paid soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hands, with a sudden flash of joy across her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wretchedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If things turn out as I expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice
trembling with indignation, <div class="bookquote">``while I have been contriving and working
that my father may have some peace of mind before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dies,--working
for the respectability of our family,--you have done all you can to
destroy both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie felt a deep movement of compunction; for the moment, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind
ceased to contend against what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt to be cruel and unreasonable,
and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) self-blame she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) justified her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``it was wrong of me; but I was so
lonely, and I was sorry for Philip. And I think enmity and hatred are
wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Your duty was clear enough. Say no more; but
promise, in the words I told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _must_ speak to Philip once more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will go with me now and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give you my word not to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) or write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) again without your
knowledge. That is the only thing I will say. I will put my hand on
the Bible if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say it, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand on the page of manuscript and repeated the
promise. Tom closed the book, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now let us go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a word was spoken as they walked along. Maggie was suffering in
anticipation of what Philip was about to suffer, and dreading the
galling words that would fall on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) from Tom's lips; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt it
was in vain to attempt anything but submission. Tom had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) terrible
clutch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conscience and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deepest dread; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) writhed under the
demonstrable truth of the character he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conduct, and
yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whole soul rebelled against it as unfair from its
incompleteness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), meanwhile, felt the impetus of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) indignation
diverted toward Philip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not know how much of an old boyish
repulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity was concerned in
the bitter severity of the words by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) meant to do the duty of a
son and a brother. Tom was not given to inquire subtly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own
motives any more than into other matters of an intangible kind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
quite sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own motives as well as actions were good, else he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
would have had nothing to do with them.

<p/>Maggie's only hope was that something might, for the first time, have
prevented Philip from coming. Then there would be delay,--then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might get Tom's permission to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart beat with double
violence when they got under the Scotch firs. It was the last moment
of suspense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought; Philip always met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) got
beyond them. But they passed across the more open green space, and
entered the narrow bushy path by the mound. Another turning, and they
came so close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that both Tom and Philip stopped suddenly
within a yard of each other. There was a moment's silence, in which
Philip darted a look of inquiry at Maggie's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw an answer
there, in the pale, parted lips, and the terrified tension of the
large eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination, always rushing extravagantly beyond an
immediate impression, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tall, strong brother grasping the feeble
Philip bodily, crushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and trampling on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom
said, in a voice of harsh scorn, as soon as Philip's eyes were turned
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>answered Philip, haughtily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mean? Stand farther from me, lest I should lay hands on you, and I'll
tell you what I mean. I mean, taking advantage of a young girl's
foolishness and ignorance to get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to have secret meetings with you.
I mean, daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has
a good and honest name to support.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I deny that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>interrupted Philip, impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``I could never trifle
with anything that affected your sister's happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is dearer to
me than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is to you; I honor her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) more than you can ever honor her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); I
would give up my life to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk high-flown nonsense to me, sir! Do you mean to pretend
that you didn't know it would be injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to meet you here
week after week? Do you pretend you had any right to make professions
of love to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), even if you had been a fit husband for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), when
neither her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage
between you? And _you_,--_you_ to try and worm yourself into the
affections of a handsome girl who is not eighteen, and has been shut
out from the world by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's misfortunes! That's your crooked
notion of honor, is it? I call it base treachery; I call it taking
advantage of circumstances to win what's too good for you,--what you'd
never get by fair means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is manly of you to talk in this way to _me_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip,
bitterly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) whole frame shaken by violent emotions. <div class="bookquote">``Giants have an
immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse. You are incapable
even of understanding what I feel for your sister. I feel so much for
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that I could even desire to be at friendship with _you_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very sorry to understand your feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with
scorching contempt. <div class="bookquote">``What I wish is that you should understand
_me_,--that I shall take care of _my_ sister, and that if you dare to
make the least attempt to come near her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), or to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), or to
keep the slightest hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind, your puny, miserable body, that
ought to have put some modesty into your mind, shall not protect you.
I'll thrash you; I'll hold you up to public scorn. Who wouldn't laugh
at the idea of _your_ turning lover to a fine girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) burst out, in a
convulsed voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, making a strong effort to speak. Then
looking at Tom, <div class="bookquote">``You have dragged your sister here, I suppose, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may stand by while you threaten and insult me. These naturally
seemed to you the right means to influence me. But you are mistaken.
Let your sister speak. If she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is bound to give me up, I shall
abide by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wishes to the slightest word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was for my father's sake, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, imploringly. <div class="bookquote">``Tom
threatens to tell my father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't bear it; I have promised,
I have vowed solemnly, that we will not have any intercourse without
my brother's knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is enough, Maggie. _I_ shall not change; but I wish you to hold
yourself entirely free. But trust me; remember that I can never seek
for anything but good to what belongs to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, exasperated by this attitude of Philip's, <div class="bookquote">``you can
talk of seeking good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and what belongs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now; did you seek
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) good before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did,--at some risk, perhaps. But I wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to have a friend for
life,--who would cherish her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), who would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more justice than a
coarse and narrow-minded brother, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has always lavished her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
affections on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my way of befriending her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is different from yours; and I'll tell
you what is my way. I'll save her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from disobeying and disgracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father; I'll save her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from throwing herself away on you,--from making
herself a laughing-stock,--from being flouted by a man like _your_
father, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s not good enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son. You know well
enough what sort of justice and cherishing you were preparing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).
I'm not to be imposed upon by fine words; I can see what actions mean.
Come away, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seized Maggie's right wrist as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spoke, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) left
hand. Philip clasped it an instant, with one eager look, and then
hurried away.

<p/>Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was still
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wrist tightly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were compelling a culprit from the
scene of action. At last Maggie, with a violent snatch, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand
away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pent-up, long-gathered irritation burst into utterance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't suppose that I think you are right, Tom, or that I bow to your
will. I despise the feelings you have shown in speaking to Philip; I
detest your insulting, unmanly allusions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) deformity. You have
been reproaching other people all your life; you have been always sure
you yourself are right. It is because you have not a mind large enough
to see that there is anything better than your own conduct and your
own petty aims.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, coolly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see that your conduct is
better, or your aims either. If your conduct, and Philip Wakem's
conduct, has been right, why are you ashamed of its being known?
Answer me that. I know what I have aimed at in my conduct, and I've
succeeded; pray, what good has your conduct brought to you or any one
else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to defend myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, still with vehemence: <div class="bookquote">``I
know I've been wrong,--often, continually. But yet, sometimes when I
have done wrong, it has been because I have feelings that you would be
the better for, if you had them. If _you_ were in fault ever, if you
had done anything very wrong, I should be sorry for the pain it
brought you; I should not want punishment to be heaped on you. But you
have always enjoyed punishing me; you have always been hard and cruel
to me; even when I was a little girl, and always loved you better than
any one else in the world, you would let me go crying to bed without
forgiving me. You have no pity; you have no sense of your own
imperfection and your own sins. It is a sin to be hard; it is not
fitting for a mortal, for a Christian. You are nothing but a Pharisee.
You thank God for nothing but your own virtues; you think they are
great enough to win you everything else. You have not even a vision of
feelings by the side of which your shining virtues are mere darkness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with cold scorn, <div class="bookquote">``if your feelings are so much
better than mine, let me see you show them in some other way than by
conduct that's likely to disgrace us all,--than by ridiculous flights
first into one extreme and then into another. Pray, how have you shown
your love, that you talk of, either to me or my father? By disobeying
and deceiving us. I have a different way of showing my affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are a man, Tom, and have power, and can do something in
the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, if you can do nothing, submit to those that can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I _will_ submit to what I acknowledge and feel to be right. I will
submit even to what is unreasonable from my father, but I will not
submit to it from you. You boast of your virtues as if they purchased
you a right to be cruel and unmanly, as you've been to-day. Don't
suppose I would give up Philip Wakem in obedience to you. The
deformity you insult would make me cling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) and care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) the
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; that is your view of things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, more coldly than
ever; <div class="bookquote">``you need say no more to show me what a wide distance there is
between us. Let us remember that in future, and be silent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom went back to St. Ogg's, to fulfill an appointment with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle
Deane, and receive directions about a journey on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was to set
out the next morning.

<p/>Maggie went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own room to pour out all that indignant
remonstrance, against which Tom's mind was close barred, in bitter
tears. Then, when the first burst of unsatisfied anger was gone by,
came the recollection of that quiet time before the pleasure which had
ended in to-day's misery had perturbed the clearness and simplicity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) used to think in that time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had made great
conquests, and won a lasting stand on serene heights above worldly
temptations and conflict. And here she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was down again in the thick of
a hot strife with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own and others' passions. Life was not so short,
then, and perfect rest was not so near as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had dreamed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
two years younger. There was more struggle for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and perhaps more
falling. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was entirely wrong, and that Tom had
been entirely right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could sooner have recovered more inward
harmony; but now her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) penitence and submission were constantly
obstructed by resentment that would present itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) no otherwise
than as a just indignation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart bled for Philip; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on
recalling the insults that had been flung at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with so vivid a
conception of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had felt under them, that it was almost like a
sharp bodily pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), making her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) beat the floor with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) foot and
tighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fingers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) palm.

<p/>And yet, how was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was now and then conscious of a certain
dim background of relief in the forced separation from Philip? Surely
it was only because the sense of a deliverance from concealment was
welcome at any cost.



<p/>Chapter VI

<p/>The Hard-Won Triumph


<p/>Three weeks later, when Dorlcote Mill was at its prettiest moment in
all the year,--the great chestnuts in blossom, and the grass all deep
and daisied,--Tom Tulliver came home to it earlier than usual in the
evening, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) passed over the bridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked with the old
deep-rooted affection at the respectable red brick house, which always
seemed cheerful and inviting outside, let the rooms be as bare and the
hearts as sad as they might inside. There is a very pleasant light in
Tom's blue-gray eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glances at the house-windows; that fold in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brow never disappears, but it is not unbecoming; it seems to imply
a strength of will that may possibly be without harshness, when the
eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) firm step becomes
quicker, and the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth rebel against the compression
which is meant to forbid a smile.

<p/>The eyes in the parlor were not turned toward the bridge just then,
and the group there was sitting in unexpectant silence,--Mr. Tulliver
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) arm-chair, tired with a long ride, and ruminating with a worn
look, fixed chiefly on Maggie, who was bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sewing while
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother was making the tea.

<p/>They all looked up with surprise when they heard the well-known foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's up now, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``You're a bit earlier than
usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there was nothing more for me to do, so I came away. Well,
mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), a sign of unusual good-humor
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Hardly a word or look had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Maggie in
all the three weeks; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) usual incommunicativeness at home
prevented this from being noticeable to their parents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, when they had finished tea, <div class="bookquote">``do you know exactly
how much money there is in the tin box?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a hundred and ninety-three pound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``You've
brought less o' late; but young fellows like to have their own way
with their money. Though I didn't do as I liked before _I_ was of
age.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) spoke with rather timid discontent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure that's the sum, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you
would take the trouble to fetch the tin box down. I think you have
perhaps made a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I make a mistake?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``I've counted
it often enough; but I can fetch it, if you won't believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was always an incident Mr. Tulliver liked, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) gloomy life, to
fetch the tin box and count the money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go out of the room, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moving
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father was gone upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And isn't Maggie to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``because somebody must
take away the things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom indifferently.

<p/>That was a cutting word to Maggie. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart had leaped with the
sudden conviction that Tom was going to tell their father the debts
could be paid; and Tom would have let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) be absent when that news was
told! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) carried away the tray and came back immediately. The
feeling of injury on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own behalf could not predominate at that
moment.

<p/>Tom drew to the corner of the table near his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father when the tin box
was set down and opened, and the red evening light falling on them
made conspicuous the worn, sour gloom of the dark-eyed father and the
suppressed joy in the face of the fair-complexioned son. The mother
and Maggie sat at the other end of the table, the one in blank
patience, the other in palpitating expectation.

<p/>Mr. Tulliver counted out the money, setting it in order on the table,
and then said, glancing sharply at Tom:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now! you see I was right enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paused, looking at the money with bitter despondency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's more nor three hundred wanting; it'll be a fine while before
_I_ can save that. Losing that forty-two pound wi' the corn was a sore
job. This world's been too many for me. It's took four year to lay
_this_ by; it's much if I'm above ground for another four year. I must
trusten to you to pay 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on, with a trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">``if
you keep i' the same mind now you're coming o' age. But you're like
enough to bury me first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked up in Tom's face with a querulous desire for some assurance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, speaking with energetic decision, though there
was tremor discernible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice too, <div class="bookquote">``you will live to see the
debts all paid. You shall pay them with your own hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tone implied something more than mere hopefulness or resolution. A
slight electric shock seemed to pass through Mr. Tulliver, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) kept
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) eyes fixed on Tom with a look of eager inquiry, while Maggie,
unable to restrain herself, rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's side and knelt down
by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Tom was silent a little while before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good while ago, my uncle Glegg lent me a little money to trade
with, and that has answered. I have three hundred and twenty pounds in
the bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother's arms were round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck as soon as the last words were
uttered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, half crying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my boy, I knew you'd make iverything right again, when you got a
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father was silent; the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of
speech. Both Tom and Maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of
joy might even be fatal. But the blessed relief of tears came. The
broad chest heaved, the muscles of the face gave way, and the
gray-haired man burst into loud sobs. The fit of weeping gradually
subsided, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat quiet, recovering the regularity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
breathing. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and said, in a gentle
tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bessy, you must come and kiss me now--the lad has made you amends.
You'll see a bit o' comfort again, belike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had held her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand a minute, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thoughts went back to the money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd brought me the money to look at, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said,
fingering the sovereigns on the table; <div class="bookquote">``I should ha' felt surer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sovereigns</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall see it to-morrow, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. ``My uncle Deane has
appointed the creditors to meet to-morrow at the Golden Lion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>)
has ordered a dinner for them at two o'clock. My uncle Glegg and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
will both be there. It was advertised in the <div class="bookquote">``Messenger' on Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Wakem knows on't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye kindling with
triumphant fire. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on, with a long-drawn guttural
enunciation, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) snuff-box, the only luxury he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had left
himself, and tapping it with something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old air of defiance.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll get from under _his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)_ thumb now, though I _must_ leave the old
mill. I thought I could ha' held out to die here--but I can't--we've
got a glass o' nothing in the house, have we, Bessy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, drawing out her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) much-reduced bunch of keys,
<div class="bookquote">``there's some brandy sister Deane brought me when I was ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get it me, then; get it me. I feel a bit weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, in a stronger voice, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had taken some
brandy-and-water, <div class="bookquote">``you shall make a speech to 'em. I'll tell 'em it's
you as got the best part o' the money. They'll see I'm honest at last,
and ha' got an honest son. Ah! Wakem `ud be fine and glad to have a
son like mine,--a fine straight fellow,--i`stead o' that poor crooked
creatur! You'll prosper i' the world, my lad; you'll maybe see the day
when Wakem and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son `ull be a round or two below you. You'll like
enough be ta'en into partnership, as your uncle Deane was before
you,--you're in the right way for`t; and then there's nothing to
hinder your getting rich. And if ever you're rich enough--mind
this--try and get th' old mill again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) chair; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind, which had so
long been the home of nothing but bitter discontent and foreboding,
suddenly filled, by the magic of joy, with visions of good fortune.
But some subtle influence prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) from foreseeing the good
fortune as happening to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shake hands wi' me, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said, suddenly putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a great thing when a man can be proud as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got a good son.
I've had _that_ luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom never lived to taste another moment so delicious as that; and
Maggie couldn't help forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own grievances. Tom _was_ good;
and in the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments of true
admiration and gratitude, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt that the faults he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had to pardon in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never been redeemed, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) faults were. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt no jealousy
this evening that, for the first time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemed to be thrown into
the background in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's mind.

<p/>There was much more talk before bedtime. Mr. Tulliver naturally wanted
to hear all the particulars of Tom's trading adventures, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
listened with growing excitement and delight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was curious to know
what had been said on every occasion; if possible, what had been
thought; and Bob Jakin's part in the business threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) into peculiar
outbursts of sympathy with the triumphant knowingness of that
remarkable packman. Bob's juvenile history, so far as it had come
under Mr. Tulliver's knowledge, was recalled with that sense of
astonishing promise it displayed, which is observable in all
reminiscences of the childhood of great men.

<p/>It was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under
the vague but fierce sense of triumph over Wakem, which would
otherwise have been the channel his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) joy would have rushed into with
dangerous force. Even as it was, that feeling from time to time gave
threats of its ultimate mastery, in sudden bursts of irrelevant
exclamation.

<p/>It was long before Mr. Tulliver got to sleep that night; and the
sleep, when it came, was filled with vivid dreams. At half-past five
o'clock in the morning, when Mrs. Tulliver was already rising, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) by starting up with a sort of smothered shout, and looking
round in a bewildered way at the walls of the bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Mr. Tulliver?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
still with a puzzled expression, and said at last:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--I was dreaming--did I make a noise?--I thought I'd got hold of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter VII

<p/>A Day of Reckoning


<p/>Mr. Tulliver was an essentially sober man,--able to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) glass and
not averse to it, but never exceeding the bounds of moderation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
naturally an active Hotspur temperament, which did not crave liquid
fire to set it aglow; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) impetuosity was usually equal to an exciting
occasion without any such reinforcements; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) desire for the
brandy-and-water implied that the too sudden joy had fallen with a
dangerous shock on a frame depressed by four years of gloom and
unaccustomed hard fare. But that first doubtful tottering moment
passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) seemed to gather strength with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) gathering excitement;
and the next day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was seated at table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) creditors, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
eye kindling and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) cheek flushed with the consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was
about to make an honorable figure once more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) looked more like the
proud, confident, warm-hearted, and warm-tempered Tulliver of old
times than might have seemed possible to any one who had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) a
week before, riding along as had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wont for the last four years
since the sense of failure and debt had been upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>),--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) head
hanging down, casting brief, unwilling looks on those who forced
themselves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) speech, asserting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) honest
principles with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) old confident eagerness, alluding to the rascals
and the luck that had been against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had triumphed
over, to some extent, by hard efforts and the aid of a good son; and
winding up with the story of how Tom had got the best part of the
needful money. But the streak of irritation and hostile triumph seemed
to melt for a little while into purer fatherly pride and pleasure,
when, Tom's health having been proposed, and uncle Deane having taken
occasion to say a few words of eulogy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) general character and
conduct, Tom himself got up and made the single speech of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life. It
could hardly have been briefer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thanked the gentlemen for the honor
they had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been able to help his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father in proving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) integrity and regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) honest name; and,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own part, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should never undo that work and disgrace
that name. But the applause that followed was so great, and Tom looked
so gentlemanly as well as tall and straight, that Mr. Tulliver
remarked, in an explanatory manner, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) friends on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) right and
left, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had spent a deal of money on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) son's education.

<p/>The party broke up in very sober fashion at five o'clock. Tom remained
in St. Ogg's to attend to some business, and Mr. Tulliver mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
horse to go home, and describe the memorable things that had been said
and done, to <div class="bookquote">``poor Bessy and the little wench.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>The air of excitement
that hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was but faintly due to good cheer or any stimulus
but the potent wine of triumphant joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) did not choose any back
street to-day, but rode slowly, with uplifted head and free glances,
along the principal street all the way to the bridge.

<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) not happen to meet Wakem? The want of that coincidence
vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and set his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mind at work in an irritating way. Perhaps
Wakem was gone out of town to-day on purpose to avoid seeing or
hearing anything of an honorable action which might well cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
some unpleasant twinges. If Wakem were to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) then, Mr. Tulliver
would look straight at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), and the rascal would perhaps be forsaken a
little by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) cool, domineering impudence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would know by and by
that an honest man was not going to serve _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ any longer, and lend
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honesty to fill a pocket already over-full of dishonest gains.
Perhaps the luck was beginning to turn; perhaps the Devil didn't
always hold the best cards in this world.

<p/>Simmering in this way, Mr. Tulliver approached the yardgates of
Dorlcote Mill, near enough to see a well-known figure coming out of
them on a fine black horse. They met about fifty yards from the gates,
between the great chestnuts and elms and the high bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, abruptly, in a haughtier tone than usual,
<div class="bookquote">``what a fool's trick you did,--spreading those hard lumps on that Far
Close! I told you how it would be; but you men never learn to farm
with any method.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tulliver, suddenly boiling up; <div class="bookquote">``get somebody else to farm
for you, then, as'll ask _you_ to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been drinking, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, really believing that
this was the meaning of Tulliver's flushed face and sparkling eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've not been drinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tulliver; <div class="bookquote">``I want no drinking to
help me make up my mind as I'll serve no longer under a scoundrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! you may leave my premises to-morrow, then; hold your
insolent tongue and let me pass.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Tulliver was backing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse
across the road to hem Wakem in.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I _sha'n't_ let you pass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tulliver, getting fiercer. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall tell you what I think of you first. You're too big a raskill to
get hanged--you're--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me pass, you ignorant brute, or I'll ride over you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tulliver, spurring his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) whip, made a rush
forward; and Wakem's horse, rearing and staggering backward, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
rider from the saddle and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) sideways on the ground. Wakem had
had the presence of mind to loose the bridle at once, and as the horse
only staggered a few paces and then stood still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) might have risen
and remounted without more inconvenience than a bruise and a shake.
But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) could rise, Tulliver was off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) horse too. The sight of
the long-hated predominant man down, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) power, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) into
a frenzy of triumphant vengeance, which seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
preternatural agility and strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) rushed on Wakem, who was in the
act of trying to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) feet, grasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) by the left arm so as
to press Wakem's whole weight on the right arm, which rested on the
ground, and flogged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) fiercely across the back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) riding-whip.
Wakem shouted for help, but no help came, until a woman's scream was
heard, and the cry of <div class="bookquote">``Father, father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>woman scream</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly, Wakem felt, something had arrested Mr. Tulliver's arm; for
the flogging ceased, and the grasp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) own arm was relaxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get away with you--go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tulliver, angrily. But it was not to
Wakem that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) spoke. Slowly the lawyer rose, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
head, saw that Tulliver's arms were being held by a girl, rather by
the fear of hurting the girl that clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) young
might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Luke--mother--come and help Mr. Wakem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie cried, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
heard the longed-for footsteps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help me on to that low horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem to Luke, <div class="bookquote">``then I shall
perhaps manage; though--confound it--I think this arm is sprained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>With some difficulty, Wakem was heaved on to Tulliver's horse. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
turned toward the miller and said, with white rage, <div class="bookquote">``You'll suffer for
this, sir. Your daughter is a witness that you've assaulted me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tulliver, in a thick, fierce voice; <div class="bookquote">``go and
show your back, and tell 'em I thrashed you. Tell 'em I've made things
a bit more even i' the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tulliver/Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ride my horse home with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem to Luke. <div class="bookquote">``By the Tofton
Ferry, not through the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, imploringly. Then, seeing that Wakem
had ridden off, and that no further violence was possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
slackened her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hold and burst into hysteric sobs, while poor Mrs.
Tulliver stood by in silence, quivering with fear. But Maggie became
conscious that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was slackening her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father was beginning
to grasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and lean on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). The surprise checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel ill--faintish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Help me in, Bessy--I'm giddy--I've a
pain i' the head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked in slowly, propped by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife and daughter and tottered
into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm-chair. The almost purple flush had given way to paleness,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand was cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we better send for the doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to be too faint and suffering to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>); but presently,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said to Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``Go and seek for somebody to fetch the
doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with full comprehension, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Doctor? No--no doctor. It's my head, that's all. Help me to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sad ending to the day that had risen on them all like a beginning of
better times! But mingled seed must bear a mingled crop.

<p/>In half an hour after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father had lain down Tom came home. Bob
Jakin was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>), come to congratulate <div class="bookquote">``the old master,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>not without
some excusable pride that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) share in bringing about Mr.
Tom's good luck; and Tom had thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father would like nothing
better, as a finish to the day, than a talk with Bob. But now Tom
could only spend the evening in gloomy expectation of the unpleasant
consequences that must follow on this mad outbreak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's
long-smothered hate. After the painful news had been told, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat in
silence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not spirit or inclination to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother and
sister anything about the dinner; they hardly cared to ask it.
Apparently the mingled thread in the web of their life was so
curiously twisted together that there could be no joy without a sorrow
coming close upon it. Tom was dejected by the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
exemplary effort must always be baffled by the wrong-doing of others;
Maggie was living through, over and over again, the agony of the
moment in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had rushed to throw herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's arm,
with a vague, shuddering foreboding of wretched scenes to come. Not
one of the three felt any particular alarm about Mr. Tulliver's
health; the symptoms did not recall his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) former dangerous attack, and
it seemed only a necessary consequence that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) violent passion and
effort of strength, after many hours of unusual excitement, should
have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) feel ill. Rest would probably cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).

<p/>Tom, tired out by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) active day, fell asleep soon, and slept soundly;
it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had only just come to bed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waked to
see his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the gray light of early morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My boy, you must get up this minute; I've sent for the doctor, and
your father wants you and Maggie to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) worse, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s been very ill all night with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't say it's
worse; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only said suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``Bessy, fetch the boy and girl. Tell 'em
to make haste.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie and Tom threw on their clothes hastily in the chill gray light,
and reached their father's room almost at the same moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
watching for them with an expression of pain on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brow, but with
sharpened, anxious consciousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes. Mrs. Tulliver stood at
the foot of the bed, frightened and trembling, looking worn and aged
from disturbed rest. Maggie was at the bedside first, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's
glance was toward Tom, who came and stood next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, my lad, it's come upon me as I sha'n't get up again. This
world's been too many for me, my lad, but you've done what you could
to make things a bit even. Shake hands wi' me again, my lad, before I
go away from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father hands</b></font>)</div><p/>The father and son clasped hands and looked at each other an instant.
Then Tom said, trying to speak firmly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any wish, father--that I can fulfil, when--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, my lad--you'll try and get the old mill back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there's your mother--you'll try and make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) amends, all you can,
for my bad luck--and there's the little wench--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The father turned his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes on Maggie with a still more eager look,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), with a bursting heart, sank on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees, to be closer to
the dear, time-worn face which had been present with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) through long
years, as the sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deepest love and hardest trial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Tom--don't you fret, my wench--there'll
come somebody as'll love you and take your part--and you must be good
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), my lad. I was good to _my_ sister. Kiss me, Maggie.--Come,
Bessy.--You'll manage to pay for a brick grave, Tom, so as your mother
and me can lie together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked away from them all when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said this, and lay silent for
some minutes, while they stood watching him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), not daring to move. The
morning light was growing clearer for them, and they could see the
heaviness gathering in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, and the dulness in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes. But at
last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked toward Tom and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had my turn--I beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). That was nothing but fair. I never wanted
anything but what was fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, father, dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, an unspeakable anxiety
predominating over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) grief, <div class="bookquote">``you forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--you forgive every one
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not move his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my wench. I don't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). What's forgiving to do? I can't
love a raskill--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice had become thicker; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to say more, and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
lips again and again, struggling in vain to speak. At length the words
forced their way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does God forgive raskills?--but if He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't be hard wi' me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands moved uneasily, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted them to remove some
obstruction that weighed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Two or three times there fell from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) some broken words,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This world's--too many--honest man--puzzling--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon they merged into mere mutterings; the eyes had ceased to discern;
and then came the final silence.

<p/>But not of death. For an hour or more the chest heaved, the loud, hard
breathing continued, getting gradually slower, as the cold dews
gathered on the brow.

<p/>At last there was total stillness, and poor Tulliver's dimly lighted
soul had forever ceased to be vexed with the painful riddle of this
world.

<p/>Help was come now; Luke and his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) wife were there, and Mr. Turnbull had
arrived, too late for everything but to say, <div class="bookquote">``This is death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Turnbull</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom and Maggie went downstairs together into the room where their
father's place was empty. Their eyes turned to the same spot, and
Maggie spoke,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, forgive me--let us always love each other'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>; and they clung and
wept together.




<p/>Book VI

<p/>_The Great Temptation_



<p/>Chapter I

<p/>A Duet in Paradise


<p/>The well-furnished drawing-room, with the open grand piano, and the
pleasant outlook down a sloping garden to a boat-house by the side of
the Floss, is Mr. Deane's. The neat little lady in mourning, whose
light-brown ringlets are falling over the colored embroidery with
which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers are busy, is of course Lucy Deane; and the fine
young man who is leaning down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) chair to snap the scissors in
the extremely abbreviated face of the <div class="bookquote">``King Charles''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>lying on the
young lady's feet is no other than Mr. Stephen Guest, whose diamond
ring, attar of roses, and air of _nonchalant_ leisure, at twelve
o'clock in the day, are the graceful and odoriferous result of the
largest oil-mill and the most extensive wharf in St. Ogg's. There is
an apparent triviality in the action with the scissors, but your
discernment perceives at once that there is a design in it which makes
it eminently worthy of a large-headed, long-limbed young man; for you
see that Lucy wants the scissors, and is compelled, reluctant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
may be, to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ringlets back, raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soft hazel eyes, smile
playfully down on the face that is so very nearly on a level with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
knee, and holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little shell-pink palm, to say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My scissors, please, if you can renounce the great pleasure of
persecuting my poor Minny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The foolish scissors have slipped too far over the knuckles, it seems,
and Hercules holds out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) entrapped fingers hopelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound the scissors! The oval lies the wrong way. Please draw them
off for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Draw them off with your other hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>says Miss Lucy, roguishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but that's my left hand; I'm not left-handed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy laughs, and the scissors are drawn off with gentle touches from
tiny tips, which naturally dispose Mr. Stephen for a repetition _da
capo_. Accordingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) watches for the release of the scissors, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) may get them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) possession again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, sticking them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) band, <div class="bookquote">``you shall not have my
scissors again,--you have strained them already. Now don't set Minny
growling again. Sit up and behave properly, and then I will tell you
some news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, throwing himself back and hanging his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
right arm over the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) might have been sitting for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) portrait, which would have represented a rather striking young man
of five-and-twenty, with a square forehead, short dark-brown hair,
standing erect, with a slight wave at the end, like a thick crop of
corn, and a half-ardent, half-sarcastic glance from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
well-marked horizontal eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``Is it very important news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very. Guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going to change Minny's diet, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) three ratafias
soaked in a dessert-spoonful of cream daily?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, then, Dr. Kenn has been preaching against buckram, and you
ladies have all been sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) a roundrobin, saying, <div class="bookquote">``This is a hard
doctrine; who can bear it?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) little mouth gravely. <div class="bookquote">``It is
rather dull of you not to guess my news, because it is about something
I mentioned to you not very long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have mentioned many things to me not long ago. Does your
feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one
of several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know you think I am silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are perfectly charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my silliness is part of my charm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say _that_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I know you like women to be rather insipid. Philip Wakem betrayed
you; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) said so one day when you were not here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know Phil is fierce on that point; he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) makes it quite a personal
matter. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) must be love-sick for some unknown lady,--some
exalted Beatrice whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) met abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, pausing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) work, <div class="bookquote">``it has just occurred to
me that I never found out whether my cousin Maggie will object to see
Philip, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother does. Tom will not enter a room where Philip
is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knows it; perhaps Maggie may be the same, and then we
sha'n't be able to sing our glees, shall we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is your cousin coming to stay with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, with a
look of slight annoyance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that was my news, which you have forgotten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s going to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) situation, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has been nearly two years, poor thing,--ever
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's death; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will stay with me a month or
two,--many months, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I bound to be pleased at that news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with a little air of pique. <div class="bookquote">''_I_ am
pleased, but that, of course, is no reason why _you_ should be
pleased. There is no girl in the world I love so well as my cousin
Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will be inseparable I suppose, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) comes. There will be
no possibility of a _tête-à-tête_ with you any more, unless you can
find an admirer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), who will pair off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) occasionally. What
is the ground of dislike to Philip? He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might have been a resource.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a family quarrel with Philip's father. There were very painful
circumstances, I believe. I never quite understood them, or knew them
all. My uncle Tulliver was unfortunate and lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) property, and
I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) considered Mr. Wakem was somehow the cause of it. Mr. Wakem
bought Dorlcote Mill, my uncle's old place, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) always lived. You
must remember my uncle Tulliver, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, with rather supercilious indifference. <div class="bookquote">``I've
always known the name, and I dare say I knew the man by sight, apart
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. I know half the names and faces in the neighborhood in
that detached, disjointed way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a very hot-tempered man. I remember, when I was a little girl
and used to go to see my cousins, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often frightened me by talking as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were angry. Papa told me there was a dreadful quarrel, the very
day before my uncle's death, between him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and Mr. Wakem, but it was
hushed up. That was when you were in London. Papa says my uncle was
quite mistaken in many ways; his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mind had become embittered. But Tom
and Maggie must naturally feel it very painful to be reminded of these
things. They have had so much, so very much trouble. Maggie was at
school with me six years ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was fetched away because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father's misfortunes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has hardly had any pleasure since, I
think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has been in a dreary situation in a school since uncle's
death, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is determined to be independent, and not live with
aunt Pullet; and I could hardly wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to come to me then, because
dear mamma was ill, and everything was so sad. That is why I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
to come to me now, and have a long, long holiday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very sweet and angelic of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with an
admiring smile; <div class="bookquote">``and all the more so if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has the conversational
qualities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor aunty! You are cruel to ridicule her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is very valuable to
_me_, I know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) manages the house beautifully,--much better than any
stranger would,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was a great comfort to me in mamma's
illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but in point of companionship one would prefer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should
be represented by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brandy-cherries and cream-cakes. I think with a
shudder that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) daughter will always be present in person, and have
no agreeable proxies of that kind,--a fat, blond girl, with round blue
eyes, who will stare at us silently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucy, laughing wickedly, and clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands,
<div class="bookquote">``that is just my cousin Maggie. You must have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed; I'm only guessing what Mrs. Tulliver's daughter must be;
and then if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is to banish Philip, our only apology for a tenor,
that will be an additional bore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope that may not be. I think I will ask you to call on Philip
and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) Maggie is coming to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is quite aware of Tom's
feeling, and always keeps out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) way; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will understand, if
you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), that I asked you to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not to come until I write
to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you had better write a pretty note for me to take; Phil is so
sensitive, you know, the least thing might frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) off coming at
all, and we had hard work to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>). I can never induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) to come
to the park; he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) doesn't like my sisters, I think. It is only your
faëry touch that can lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) ruffled feathers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table,
and touched it lightly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) lips. Little Lucy felt very proud and
happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and Stephen were in that stage of courtship which makes the
most exquisite moment of youth, the freshest blossom-time of
passion,--when each is sure of the other's love, but no formal
declaration has been made, and all is mutual divination, exalting the
most trivial word, the lightest gesture, into thrills delicate and
delicious as wafted jasmine scent. The explicitness of an engagement
wears off this finest edge of susceptibility; it is jasmine gathered
and presented in a large bouquet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on Maggie's
appearance and manners,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said the cunning Lucy, moving to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
desk, <div class="bookquote">``because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother, you know; and Tom
has not round eyes; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is as far as possible from staring at
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is like the father; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seems to be as proud as
Lucifer. Not a brilliant companion, though, I should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gave me my Minny when I lost Lolo; and papa is very
fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says Tom has excellent principles. It was through him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father was able to pay all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) debts before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ah; I've heard about that. I heard your father and mine talking
about it a little while ago, after dinner, in one of their
interminable discussions about business. They think of doing something
for young Tulliver; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) saved them from a considerable loss by riding
home in some marvellous way, like Turpin, to bring them news about the
stoppage of a bank, or something of that sort. But I was rather drowsy
at the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) seat, and sauntered to the piano, humming in
falsetto, <div class="bookquote">``Graceful Consort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) turned over the volume of <div class="bookquote">``The
Creation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which stood open on the desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and sing this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) saw Lucy rising.

<p/>``What, <div class="bookquote">``Graceful Consort'? I don't think it suits your voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind; it exactly suits my feeling, which, Philip will have it,
is the grand element of good singing. I notice men with indifferent
voices are usually of that opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Philip burst into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) invectives against ``The Creation' the
other day,'' said Lucy, seating herself at the piano. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) says it has a
sort of sugared complacency and flattering make-believe in it, as if
it were written for the birthday _fête_ of a German Grand-Duke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, pooh! He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is the fallen Adam with a soured temper. We are Adam and
Eve unfallen, in Paradise. Now, then,--the recitative, for the sake of
the moral. You will sing the whole duty of woman,--<div class="bookquote">``And from obedience
grows my pride and happiness.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I shall not respect an Adam who drags the _tempo_, as you
will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, beginning to play the duet.

<p/>Surely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in
which the lovers can sing together. The sense of mutual fitness that
springs from the two deep notes fulfilling expectation just at the
right moment between the notes of the silvery soprano, from the
perfect accord of descending thirds and fifths, from the preconcerted
loving chase of a fugue, is likely enough to supersede any immediate
demand for less impassioned forms of agreement. The contralto will not
care to catechise the bass; the tenor will foresee no embarrassing
dearth of remark in evenings spent with the lovely soprano. In the
provinces, too, where music was so scarce in that remote time, how
could the musical people avoid falling in love with each other? Even
political principle must have been in danger of relaxation under such
circumstances; and the violin, faithful to rotten boroughs, must have
been tempted to fraternize in a demoralizing way with a reforming
violoncello. In that case, the linnet-throated soprano and the
full-toned bass singing,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With thee delight is ever new,
With thee is life incessant bliss,''

 (<font color='red'><b>the soprano singing</b></font>)</div><p/>believed what they sang all the more _because_ they sang it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for Raphael's great song,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, when they had finished the
duet. <div class="bookquote">``You do the `heavy beasts' to perfection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sounds complimentary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``By
Jove, it's nearly half-past one! Well, I can just sing this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the
tread of the heavy beasts; but when a singer has an audience of two,
there is room for divided sentiments. Minny's mistress was charmed;
but Minny, who had intrenched himself, trembling, in his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) basket as
soon as the music began, found this thunder so little to his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) taste
that he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) leaped out and scampered under the remotest _chiffonnier_, as
the most eligible place in which a small dog could await the crack of
doom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Adieu, `graceful consort,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) coat across
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had done singing, and smiling down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) tall height, with
the air of rather a patronizing lover, at the little lady on the
music-stool. <div class="bookquote">``My bliss is not incessant, for I must gallop home. I
promised to be there at lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not be able to call on Philip, then? It is of no
consequence; I have said everything in my note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be engaged with your cousin to-morrow, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we are going to have a little family-party. My cousin Tom will
dine with us; and poor aunty will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) two children together for
the first time. It will be very pretty; I think a great deal about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I may come the next day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! Come and be introduced to my cousin Maggie; though you can
hardly be said not to have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), you have described her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>And there was that slight pressure of the hands, and
momentary meeting of the eyes, which will often leave a little lady
with a slight flush and smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face that do not subside
immediately when the door is closed, and with an inclination to walk
up and down the room rather than to seat herself quietly at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
embroidery, or other rational and improving occupation. At least this
was the effect on Lucy; and you will not, I hope, consider it an
indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
just glanced in the chimney-glass as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) walk brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) near it. The
desire to know that one has not looked an absolute fright during a few
hours of conversation may be construed as lying within the bounds of a
laudable benevolent consideration for others. And Lucy had so much of
this benevolence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nature that I am inclined to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) small
egoisms were impregnated with it, just as there are people not
altogether unknown to you whose small benevolences have a predominant
and somewhat rank odor of egoism. Even now, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is walking up and
down with a little triumphant flutter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) girlish heart at the
sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is loved by the person of chief consequence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
small world, you may see in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hazel eyes an ever-present sunny
benignity, in which the momentary harmless flashes of personal vanity
are quite lost; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is happy in thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lover, it is
because the thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mingles readily with all the gentle
affections and good-natured offices with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fills her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) peaceful
days. Even now, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind, with that instantaneous alternation which
makes two currents of feeling or imagination seem simultaneous, is
glancing continually from Stephen to the preparations she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has only
half finished in Maggie's room. Cousin Maggie should be treated as
well as the grandest lady-visitor,--nay, better, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have
Lucy's best prints and drawings in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bedroom, and the very finest
bouquet of spring flowers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) table. Maggie would enjoy all that,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was so found of pretty things! And there was poor aunt Tulliver,
that no one made any account of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to be surprised with the
present of a cap of superlative quality, and to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) health drunk
in a gratifying manner, for which Lucy was going to lay a plot with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father this evening. Clearly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not time to indulge in long
reveries about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own happy love-affairs. With this thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
walked toward the door, but paused there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, then, Minny?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, stooping in answer to some
whimpering of that small quadruped, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) glossy head
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pink cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Did you think I was going without you? Come,
then, let us go and see Sinbad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sinbad</b></font>)</div><p/>Sinbad was Lucy's chestnut horse, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) always fed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own
hand when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>) was turned out in the paddock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was fond of feeding
dependent creatures, and knew the private tastes of all the animals
about the house, delighting in the little rippling sounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
canaries when their beaks were busy with fresh seed, and in the small
nibbling pleasures of certain animals which, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should appear
too trivial, I will here call <div class="bookquote">``the more familiar rodents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Was not Stephen Guest right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) decided opinion that this slim
maiden of eighteen was quite the sort of wife a man would not be
likely to repent of marrying,--a woman who was loving and thoughtful
for other women, not giving them Judas-kisses with eyes askance on
their welcome defects, but with real care and vision for their
half-hidden pains and mortifications, with long ruminating enjoyment
of little pleasures prepared for them? Perhaps the emphasis of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
admiration did not fall precisely on this rarest quality in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>);
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own choice of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chiefly because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not
strike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a remarkable rarity. A man likes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife to be pretty;
well, Lucy was pretty, but not to a maddening extent. A man likes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife to be accomplished, gentle, affectionate, and not stupid; and
Lucy had all these qualifications. Stephen was not surprised to find
himself in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and was conscious of excellent judgment in
preferring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to Miss Leyburn, the daughter of the county member,
although Lucy was only the daughter of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) father's subordinate
partner; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had had to defy and overcome a slight
unwillingness and disappointment in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) father and sisters,--a
circumstance which gives a young man an agreeable consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own dignity. Stephen was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had sense and independence
enough to choose the wife who was likely to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) happy, unbiassed
by any indirect considerations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) meant to choose Lucy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was a
little darling, and exactly the sort of woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had always admired.



<p/>Chapter II

<p/>First Impressions


<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>) is very clever, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chapter II First Impressions</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was kneeling on a
footstool at Maggie's feet, after placing that dark lady in the large
crimson-velvet chair. <div class="bookquote">``I feel sure you will like him (<font color='blue'><b>Sinbad</b></font>). I hope you
will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very difficult to please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling, and
holding up one of Lucy's long curls, that the sunlight might shine
through it. <div class="bookquote">``A gentleman who thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is good enough for Lucy must
expect to be sharply criticised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a great deal too good for me. And sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is
away, I almost think it can't really be that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) loves me. But I can
never doubt it when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is with me, though I couldn't bear any one but
you to know that I feel in that way, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then, if I disapprove of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) you can give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up, since you are
not engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with playful gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not be engaged. When people are engaged, they begin to
think of being married soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, too thoroughly preoccupied to
notice Maggie's joke; <div class="bookquote">``and I should like everything to go on for a
long while just as it is. Sometimes I am quite frightened lest Stephen
should say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) has spoken to papa; and from something that fell
from papa the other day, I feel sure he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and Mr. Guest are expecting
that. And Stephen's sisters are very civil to me now. At first, I
think they didn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) paying me attention; and that was natural.
It _does_ seem out of keeping that I should ever live in a great place
like the Park House, such a little insignificant thing as I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But people are not expected to be large in proportion to the houses
they live in, like snails,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, are Mr.
Guest's sisters giantesses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; and not handsome,--that is, not very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy,
half-penitent at this uncharitable remark. <div class="bookquote">``But _he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)_ is--at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)
is generally considered very handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though you are unable to share that opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, blushing pink over brow and neck. <div class="bookquote">``It
is a bad plan to raise expectation; you will perhaps be disappointed.
But I have prepared a charming surprise for _him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>);_ I shall have a
glorious laugh against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>). I shall not tell you what it is, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knees and went to a little distance, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
pretty head on one side, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been arranging Maggie for a
portrait, and wished to judge of the general effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand up a moment, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your pleasure now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling languidly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair and looked down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) slight, aerial cousin,
whose figure was quite subordinate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) faultless drapery of silk
and crape.

<p/>Lucy kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) contemplative attitude a moment or two in silence, and
then said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think what witchery it is in you, Maggie, that makes you look
best in shabby clothes; though you really must have a new dress now.
But do you know, last night I was trying to fancy you in a handsome,
fashionable dress, and do what I would, that old limp merino would
come back as the only right thing for you. I wonder if Marie
Antoinette looked all the grander when her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) gown was darned at the
elbows. Now, if _I_ were to put anything shabby on, I should be quite
unnoticeable. I should be a mere rag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with mock gravity. <div class="bookquote">``You would be liable to
be swept out of the room with the cobwebs and carpet-dust, and to find
yourself under the grate, like Cinderella. Mayn't I sit down now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, now you may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, laughing. Then, with an air of serious
reflection, unfastening her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) large jet brooch, <div class="bookquote">``But you must change
brooches, Maggie; that little butterfly looks silly on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But won't that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, seating herself submissively, while Lucy knelt again and
unfastened the contemptible butterfly. <div class="bookquote">``I wish my mother were of your
opinion, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was fretting last night because this is my best
frock. I've been saving my money to pay for some lessons; I shall
never get a better situation without more accomplishments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie gave a little sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't put on that sad look again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, pinning the large
brooch below Maggie's fine throat. <div class="bookquote">``You're forgetting that you've left
that dreary schoolroom behind you, and have no little girls' clothes
to mend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``It is with me as I used to think it would be with
the poor uneasy white bear I saw at the show. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) must have
got so stupid with the habit of turning backward and forward in that
narrow space that he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would keep doing it if they set him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) free. One
gets a bad habit of being unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall put you under a discipline of pleasure that will make you
lose that bad habit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, sticking the black butterfly absently
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own collar, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes met Maggie's affectionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You dear, tiny thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bursts of loving
admiration, <div class="bookquote">``you enjoy other people's happiness so much, I believe you
would do without any of your own. I wish I were like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never been tried in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I've always been so
happy. I don't know whether I could bear much trouble; I never had any
but poor mamma's death. You _have_ been tried, Maggie; and I'm sure
you feel for other people quite as much as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head slowly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't enjoy their
happiness as you do, else I should be more contented. I do feel for
them when they are in trouble; I don't think I could ever bear to make
any one _un_happy; and yet I often hate myself, because I get angry
sometimes at the sight of happy people. I think I get worse as I get
older, more selfish. That seems very dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, in a tone of remonstrance, <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe
a word of that. It is all a gloomy fancy, just because you are
depressed by a dull, wearisome life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, resolutely clearing away the
clouds from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face with a bright smile, and throwing herself
backward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it comes from the school diet,--watery
rice-pudding spiced with Pinnock. Let us hope it will give way before
my mother's custards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie took up the <div class="bookquote">``Sketch Book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>which lay by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, going
to survey the effect in the chimney-glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Mr. Guest will be obliged to go out of the room again if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)
sees you in it. Pray make haste and put another on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy hurried out of the room, but Maggie did not take the opportunity
of opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) book; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) let it fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes
wandered to the window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could see the sunshine falling on
the rich clumps of spring flowers and on the long hedge of laurels,
and beyond, the silvery breadth of the dear old Floss, that at this
distance seemed to be sleeping in a morning holiday. The sweet fresh
garden-scent came through the open window, and the birds were busy
flitting and alighting, gurgling and singing. Yet Maggie's eyes began
to fill with tears. The sight of the old scenes had made the rush of
memories so painful that even yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had only been able to
rejoice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's restored comfort and Tom's brotherly
friendliness as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance,
rather than in the presence of a happiness which we share. Memory and
imagination urged upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a sense of privation too keen to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
taste what was offered in the transient present. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) future, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
thought, was likely to be worse than her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) past, for after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) years of
contented renunciation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had slipped back into desire and longing;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found the image of the intense and varied life she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yearned for,
and despaired of, becoming more and more importunate. The sound of the
opening door roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and hastily wiping away her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began
to turn over the leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one pleasure, I know, Maggie, that your deepest dismalness
will never resist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, beginning to speak as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``That is music, and I mean you to have quite a
riotous feast of it. I mean you to get up your playing again, which
used to be so much better than mine, when we were at Laceham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have laughed to see me playing the little girls' tunes over
and over to them, when I took them to practise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, ``just
for the sake of fingering the dear keys again. But I don't know
whether I could play anything more difficult now than <div class="bookquote">``Begone, dull
care!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what a wild state of joy you used to be in when the glee-men
came round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) embroidery; <div class="bookquote">``and we might have
all those old glees that you used to love so, if I were certain that
you don't feel exactly as Tom does about some things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought there was nothing you might be more certain
of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought rather to have said, one particular thing. Because if you
feel just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does about that, we shall want our third voice. St.
Ogg's is so miserably provided with musical gentlemen. There are
really only Stephen and Philip Wakem who have any knowledge of music,
so as to be able to sing a part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy had looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) work as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) uttered the last sentence, and
saw that there was a change in Maggie's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it hurt you to hear the name mentioned, Maggie? If it does, I
will not speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) again. I know Tom will not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can
avoid it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel at all as Tom does on that subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, rising
and going to the window as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted to see more of the landscape.
<div class="bookquote">``I've always liked Philip Wakem ever since I was a little girl, and
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) at Lorton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was so good when Tom hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm so glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Then you won't mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coming
sometimes, and we can have much more music than we could without him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
I'm very fond of poor Philip, only I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) were not so morbid about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) deformity. I suppose it _is_ his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) deformity that makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so sad,
and sometimes bitter. It is certainly very piteous to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) poor
little crooked body and pale face among great, strong people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Lucy--''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, trying to arrest the prattling stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there is the door-bell. That must be Stephen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>Lucy went on, not
noticing Maggie's faint effort to speak. <div class="bookquote">``One of the things I most
admire in Stephen is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) makes a greater friend of Philip than any
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>It was too late for Maggie to speak now; the drawingroom door was
opening, and Minny was already growling in a small way at the entrance
of a tall gentleman, who went up to Lucy and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hand with a
half-polite, half-tender glance and tone of inquiry, which seemed to
indicate that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was unconscious of any other presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me introduce you to my cousin, Miss Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, turning
with wicked enjoyment toward Maggie, who now approached from the
farther window. <div class="bookquote">``This is Mr. Stephen Guest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>For one instant Stephen could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) astonishment at the
sight of this tall, dark-eyed nymph with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) jet-black coronet of
hair; the next, Maggie felt herself, for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life,
receiving the tribute of a very deep blush and a very deep bow from a
person toward whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself was conscious of timidity.

<p/>This new experience was very agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), so agreeable that it
almost effaced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) previous emotion about Philip. There was a new
brightness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes, and a very becoming flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
seated herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before
yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with a pretty laugh of triumph. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
lover's confusion; the advantage was usually on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This designing cousin of yours quite deceived me, Miss Tulliver,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, seating himself by Lucy, and stooping to play with
Minny, only looking at Maggie furtively. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) said you had light hair
and blue eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, it was you who said so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I only refrained
from destroying your confidence in your own second-sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could always err in the same way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">``and find
reality so much more beautiful than my preconceptions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you have proved yourself equal to the occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
<div class="bookquote">``and said what it was incumbent on you to say under the
circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) flashed a slightly defiant look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>); it was clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been drawing a satirical portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) beforehand. Lucy had
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was inclined to be satirical, and Maggie had mentally supplied
the addition, <div class="bookquote">``and rather conceited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An alarming amount of devil there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>was Stephen's first thought. The
second, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work, was, <div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would look
at me again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The next was to answer,--

<p/>``I suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true.
A man is occasionally grateful when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says ``Thank you.<div class="bookquote">'' It's rather
hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) must use the same words with which all the world
declines a disagreeable invitation, don't you think so, Miss
Tulliver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) direct glance; <div class="bookquote">``if we use
common words on a great occasion, they are the more striking, because
they are felt at once to have a particular meaning, like old banners,
or every-day clothes, hung up in a sacred place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then my compliment ought to be eloquent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, really not
quite knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said while Maggie looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``seeing that
the words were so far beneath the occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of
indifference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, flushing a little.

<p/>Lucy was rather alarmed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought Stephen and Maggie were not going
to like each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had always feared lest Maggie should appear
too old and clever to please that critical gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Why, dear
Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) interposed, <div class="bookquote">``you have always pretended that you are too
fond of being admired; and now, I think, you are angry because some
one ventures to admire you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``I like too well to feel that I am admired,
but compliments never make me feel that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never pay you a compliment again, Miss Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said
Stephen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; that will be a proof of respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Maggie! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was so unused to society that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could take nothing
as a matter of course, and had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life spoken from the lips
merely, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced
ladies, from the excessive feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was apt to throw into very
trivial incidents. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was even conscious herself of a little
absurdity in this instance. It was true she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a theoretic objection
to compliments, and had once said impatiently to Philip that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
didn't see why women were to be told with a simper that they were
beautiful, any more than old men were to be told that they were
venerable; still, to be so irritated by a common practice in the case
of a stranger like Mr. Stephen Guest, and to care about his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) having
spoken slightingly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), was certainly
unreasonable, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was silent she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to be ashamed of
herself. It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) irritation was due to the
pleasanter emotion which preceded it, just as when we are satisfied
with a sense of glowing warmth an innocent drop of cold water may fall
upon us as a sudden smart.

<p/>Stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous
conversation could have been felt embarrassing, and at once began to
talk of impersonal matters, asking Lucy if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew when the bazaar
was at length to take place, so that there might be some hope of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rain the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes on objects more grateful
than those worsted flowers that were growing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some day next month, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``But your sisters are
doing more for it than I am; they are to have the largest stall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes; but they carry on their manufactures in their own
sitting-room, where I don't intrude on them. I see you are not
addicted to the fashionable vice of fancy-work, Miss Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said
Stephen, looking at Maggie's plain hemming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``I can do nothing more difficult or more elegant
than shirt-making.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your plain sewing is so beautiful, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``that I
think I shall beg a few specimens of you to show as fancy-work. Your
exquisite sewing is quite a mystery to me, you used to dislike that
sort of work so much in old days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a mystery easily explained, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking up
quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Plain sewing was the only thing I could get money by, so I
was obliged to try and do it well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy, good and simple as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was, could not help blushing a little.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not quite like that Stephen should know that; Maggie need not
have mentioned it. Perhaps there was some pride in the confession,--
the pride of poverty that will not be ashamed of itself. But if Maggie
had been the queen of coquettes she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could hardly have invented a means
of giving greater piquancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) beauty in Stephen's eyes; I am not
sure that the quiet admission of plain sewing and poverty would have
done alone, but assisted by the beauty, they made Maggie more unlike
other women even than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seemed at first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can knit, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on, <div class="bookquote">``if that will be of any use
for your bazaar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, of infinite use. I shall set you to work with scarlet wool
to-morrow. But your sister is the most enviable person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>continued
Lucy, turning to Stephen, <div class="bookquote">``to have the talent of modelling. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is
doing a wonderful bust of Dr. Kenn entirely from memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can remember to put the eyes very near together, and the
corners of the mouth very far apart, the likeness can hardly fail to
be striking in St. Ogg's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that is very wicked of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, looking rather hurt. <div class="bookquote">``I
didn't think you would speak disrespectfully of Dr. Kenn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say anything disrespectful of Dr. Kenn? Heaven forbid! But I am not
bound to respect a libellous bust of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>). I think Kenn one of the
finest fellows in the world. I don't care much about the tall
candlesticks he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) has put on the communion-table, and I shouldn't like
to spoil my temper by getting up to early prayers every morning. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)'s the only man I ever knew personally who seems to me to have
anything of the real apostle in him (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>),--a man who has eight hundred
a-year and is contented with deal furniture and boiled beef because he (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>)
gives away two-thirds of his (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>) income. That was a very fine thing of
him (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>),--taking into his (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>) house that poor lad Grattan, who shot his (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>) mother
by accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>) sacrifices more time than a less busy man could spare,
to save the poor fellow from getting into a morbid state of mind about
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes the lad out with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) constantly, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, who had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work fall, and was
listening with keen interest. <div class="bookquote">``I never knew any one who did such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And one admires that sort of action in Kenn all the more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said
Stephen, <div class="bookquote">``because his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) manners in general are rather cold and severe.
There's nothing sugary and maudlin about him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)'s a perfect character!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with pretty
enthusiasm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; there I can't agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head
with sarcastic gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what fault can you point out in him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)'s an Anglican.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, those are the right views, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That settles the question in the abstract,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">``but not
from a parliamentary point of view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) has set the Dissenters and the
Church people by the ears; and a rising senator like myself, of whose
services the country is very much in need, will find it inconvenient
when he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) puts up for the honor of representing St. Ogg's in
Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really think of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes brightening with a
proud pleasure that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) neglect the argumentative interests of
Anglicanism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly, whenever old Mr. Leyburn's public spirit and gout induce
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to give way. My father's heart is set on it; and gifts like mine,
you know'' (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>--here Stephen drew himself up, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) large white
hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hair with playful self-admiration--<div class="bookquote">``gifts like mine
involve great responsibilities. Don't you think so, Miss Tulliver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling, but not looking up; <div class="bookquote">``so much fluency and
self-possession should not be wasted entirely on private occasions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I see how much penetration you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">``You have
discovered already that I am talkative and impudent. Now superficial
people never discern that, owing to my manner, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) doesn't look at me when I talk of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thought, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
listeners were laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I must try other subjects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Did Lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the Book Club next
week? was the next question. Then followed the recommendation to
choose Southey's <div class="bookquote">``Life of Cowper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Southey</b></font>)</div>unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) were inclined to be
philosophical, and startle the ladies of St. Ogg's by voting for one
of the Bridgewater Treatises. Of course Lucy wished to know what these
alarmingly learned books were; and as it is always pleasant to improve
the minds of ladies by talking to them at ease on subjects of which
they know nothing, Stephen became quite brilliant in an account of
Buckland's Treatise, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had just been reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was rewarded
by seeing Maggie let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work fall, and gradually get so absorbed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) wonderful geological story that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), leaning
forward with crossed arms, and with an entire absence of
self-consciousness, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been the snuffiest of old professors,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a downy-lipped alumna. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was so fascinated by the clear,
large gaze that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) forgot to look away from it occasionally
toward Lucy; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), sweet child, was only rejoicing that Stephen was
proving to Maggie how clever he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was, and that they would certainly be
good friends after all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will bring you the book, shall I, Miss Tulliver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) found the stream of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) recollections running rather shallow.
<div class="bookquote">``There are many illustrations in it that you will like to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, blushing with returning
self-consciousness at this direct address, and taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>Lucy interposed. <div class="bookquote">``I must forbid your plunging Maggie in
books. I shall never get her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) away from them; and I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to have
delicious do-nothing days, filled with boating and chatting and riding
and driving; that is the holiday she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) needs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Apropos!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we go out for a
row on the river now? The tide will suit for us to the Tofton way, and
we can walk back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>That was a delightful proposition to Maggie, for it was years since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been on the river. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was gone to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet,
Lucy lingered to give an order to the servant, and took the
opportunity of telling Stephen that Maggie had no objection to seeing
Philip, so that it was a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had sent that note the day before
yesterday. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would write another to-morrow and invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) up to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">``and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
with me in the evening, shall I? My sisters will want to call on you
when I tell them your cousin is with you. I must leave the field clear
for them in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, pray bring him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``And you _will_ like Maggie,
sha'n't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) added, in a beseeching tone. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a dear,
noble-looking creature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too tall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, smiling down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and a little too
fiery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is not my type of woman, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Gentlemen, you are aware, are apt to impart these imprudent
confidences to ladies concerning their unfavorable opinion of sister
fair ones. That is why so many women have the advantage of knowing
that they are secretly repulsive to men who have self-denyingly made
ardent love to them. And hardly anything could be more distinctively
characteristic of Lucy than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) both implicitly believed what
Stephen said, and was determined that Maggie should not know it. But
you, who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you, have
already foreseen, as the direct sequence to that unfavorable opinion
of Stephen's, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) walked down to the boathouse calculating, by the
aid of a vivid imagination, that Maggie must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand at
least twice in consequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a
gentleman who wishes ladies to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is advantageously situated
when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is rowing them in a boat. What then? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fallen in love
with this surprising daughter of Mrs. Tulliver at first sight?
Certainly not. Such passions are never heard of in real life. Besides,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was in love already, and half-engaged to the dearest little
creature in the world; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not a man to make a fool of himself
in any way. But when one is five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones
at one's finger-ends that the touch of a handsome girl should be
entirely indifferent. It was perfectly natural and safe to admire
beauty and enjoy looking at it,--at least under such circumstances as
the present. And there was really something very interesting about
this girl, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poverty and troubles; it was gratifying to see the
friendship between the two cousins. Generally, Stephen admitted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
was not fond of women who had any peculiarity of character, but here
the peculiarity seemed really of a superior kind, and provided one is
not obliged to marry such women, why, they certainly make a variety in
social intercourse.

<p/>Maggie did not fulfil Stephen's hope by looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) during the
first quarter of an hour; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes were too full of the old banks that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew so well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt lonely, cut off from Philip,--the only
person who had ever seemed to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) devotedly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had always
longed to be loved. But presently the rhythmic movement of the oars
attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should like to learn how to row.
This roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reverie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might take an
oar. It appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) required much teaching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) became
ambitious. The exercise brought the warm blood into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheeks, and
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inclined to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lesson merrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be satisfied until I can manage both oars, and row you
and Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, looking very bright as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stepped out of the
boat. Maggie, we know, was apt to forget the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was doing, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had chosen an inopportune moment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) remark; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) foot slipped,
but happily Mr. Stephen Guest held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) up with a
firm grasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not hurt yourself at all, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) said, bending to look
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face with anxiety. It was very charming to be taken care of in
that kind, graceful manner by some one taller and stronger than one's
self. Maggie had never felt just in the same way before.

<p/>When they reached home again, they found uncle and aunt Pullet seated
with Mrs. Tulliver in the drawing-room, and Stephen hurried away,
asking leave to come again in the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I want Maggie to hear your best songs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Pullet, under the certainty that Maggie would be invited to go
out with Lucy, probably to Park House, was much shocked at the
shabbiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) clothes, which when witnessed by the higher society
of St. Ogg's, would be a discredit to the family, that demanded a
strong and prompt remedy; and the consultation as to what would be
most suitable to this end from among the superfluities of Mrs.
Pullet's wardrobe was one that Lucy as well as Mrs. Tulliver entered
into with some zeal. Maggie must really have an evening dress as soon
as possible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was about the same height as aunt Pullet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s so much broader across the shoulders than I am, it's very
ill-convenient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, <div class="bookquote">``else she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might wear that beautiful
black brocade o' mine without any alteration; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms are beyond
everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Pullet, sorrowfully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) lifted Maggie's
large round arm, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'d never get my sleeves on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, never mind that, aunt; send us the dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
mean Maggie to have long sleeves, and I have abundance of black lace
for trimming. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms will look beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie's arms _are_ a pretty shape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver. <div class="bookquote">``They're
like mine used to be, only mine was never brown; I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'d had
_our_ family skin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, aunty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) aunt Tulliver's shoulder,
<div class="bookquote">``you don't understand those things. A painter would think Maggie's
complexion beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, submissively. <div class="bookquote">``You know better
than I do. Only when I was young a brown skin wasn't thought well on
among respectable folks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Pullet, who took intense interest in the ladies'
conversation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) sucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) lozenges. ``Though there was a song about
the <div class="bookquote">``Nut-brown Maid' too; I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maid</b></font>) was crazy,--crazy Kate,--but I
can't justly remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, laughing, but impatient; <div class="bookquote">``I think that
will be the end of _my_ brown skin, if it is always to be talked about
so much.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter III

<p/>Confidential Moments


<p/>When Maggie went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bedroom that night, it appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was not at all inclined to undress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) set down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) candle on the
first table that presented itself, and began to walk up and down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
room, which was a large one, with a firm, regular, and rather rapid
step, which showed that the exercise was the instinctive vent of
strong excitement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes and cheeks had an almost feverish
brilliancy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head was thrown backward, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands were clasped
with the palms outward, and with that tension of the arms which is apt
to accompany mental absorption.

<p/>Had anything remarkable happened?

<p/>Nothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree
unimportant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass
voice,--but then it was sung in a provincial, amateur fashion, such as
would have left a critical ear much to desire. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was conscious
of having been looked at a great deal, in rather a furtive manner,
from beneath a pair of well-marked horizontal eyebrows, with a glance
that seemed somehow to have caught the vibratory influence of the
voice. Such things could have had no perceptible effect on a
thoroughly well-educated young lady, with a perfectly balanced mind,
who had had all the advantages of fortune, training, and refined
society. But if Maggie had been that young lady, you would probably
have known nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life would have had so few
vicissitudes that it could hardly have been written; for the happiest
women, like the happiest nations, have no history.

<p/>In poor Maggie's highly-strung, hungry nature,--just come away from a
third-rate schoolroom, with all its jarring sounds and petty round of
tasks,--these apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and
exalting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself. It
was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought distinctly of Mr. Stephen Guest, or dwelt on
the indications that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with admiration; it was rather
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt the half-remote presence of a world of love and beauty
and delight, made up of vague, mingled images from all the poetry and
romance she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ever read, or had ever woven in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dreamy reveries.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind glanced back once or twice to the time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had courted
privation, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had thought all longing, all impatience was
subdued; but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
recoiled from the remembrance of it. No prayer, no striving now, would
bring back that negative peace; the battle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life, it seemed, was
not to be decided in that short and easy way,--by perfect renunciation
at the very threshold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) youth.

<p/>The music was vibrating in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) still,--Purcell's music, with its wild
passion and fancy,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could not stay in the recollection of that
bare, lonely past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brighter aerial world again, when a
little tap came at the door; of course it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cousin, who entered
in ample white dressing-gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Maggie, you naughty child, haven't you begun to undress?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said
Lucy, in astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``I promised not to come and talk to you,
because I thought you must be tired. But here you are, looking as if
you were ready to dress for a ball. Come, come, get on your
dressing-gown and unplait your hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, _you_ are not very forward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>retorted Maggie, hastily reaching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own pink cotton gown, and looking at Lucy's light-brown hair
brushed back in curly disorder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have not much to do. I shall sit down and talk to you till I
see you are really on the way to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>While Maggie stood and unplaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) long black hair over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pink
drapery, Lucy sat down near the toilette-table, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with
affectionate eyes, and head a little aside, like a pretty spaniel. If
it appears to you at all incredible that young ladies should be led on
to talk confidentially in a situation of this kind, I will beg you to
remember that human life furnishes many exceptional cases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You really _have_ enjoyed the music to-night, haven't you Maggie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, that is what prevented me from feeling sleepy. I think I
should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of
music. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs, and ideas into my
brain. Life seems to go on without effort, when I am filled with
music. At other times one is conscious of carrying a weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Stephen has a splendid voice, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps we are neither of us judges of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
laughing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seated herself and tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) long hair back. <div class="bookquote">``You
are not impartial, and _I_ think any barrel-organ splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me what you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), now. Tell me exactly; good and bad
too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think you should humiliate him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) a little. A lover should not be
so much at ease, and so self-confident. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) ought to tremble more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Maggie! As if any one could tremble at me! You think he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is
conceited, I see that. But you don't dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)! No. Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people,
that I should be very difficult to please? Besides, how could I
dislike any one that promised to make you happy, my dear thing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie pinched Lucy's dimpled chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have more music to-morrow evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, looking happy
already, <div class="bookquote">``for Stephen will bring Philip Wakem with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lucy, I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, turning pale. <div class="bookquote">``At least, I
could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) without Tom's leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Tom such a tyrant as that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, surprised. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take the
responsibility, then,--tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) it was my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, falteringly, <div class="bookquote">``I promised Tom very solemnly,
before my father's death,--I promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) I would not speak to Philip
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knowledge and consent. And I have a great dread of opening
the subject with Tom,--of getting into a quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable. What harm
can poor Philip have done? May I speak to Tom about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, pray don't, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) myself
to-morrow, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that you wish Philip to come. I've thought
before of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to absolve me from my promise, but I've not had
the courage to determine on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent for some moments, and then Lucy said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, you have secrets from me, and I have none from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked meditatively away from Lucy. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and
said, <div class="bookquote">``I _should_ like to tell you about Philip. But, Lucy, you must
not betray that you know it to any one--least of all to Philip
himself, or to Mr. Stephen Guest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The narrative lasted long, for Maggie had never before known the
relief of such an outpouring; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never before told Lucy anything
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) inmost life; and the sweet face bent toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with
sympathetic interest, and the little hand pressing hers, encouraged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to speak on. On two points only she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not expansive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not
betray fully what still rankled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind as Tom's great
offence,--the insults he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had heaped on Philip. Angry as the
remembrance still made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not bear that any one else
should know it at all, both for Tom's sake and Philip's. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could
not bear to tell Lucy of the last scene between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father and Wakem,
though it was this scene which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had ever since felt to be a new
barrier between herself and Philip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) merely said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw now that
Tom was, on the whole, right in regarding any prospect of love and
marriage between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and Philip as put out of the question by the
relation of the two families. Of course Philip's father would never
consent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Lucy, you have had my story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling, with the
tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You see I am like Sir Andrew Aguecheek. _I_ was
adored once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything, and have
learned so much since you left school; which always seemed to me
witchcraft before,--part of your general uncanniness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mused a little with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes downward, and then added, looking at
Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``It is very beautiful that you should love Philip; I never
thought such a happiness would befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). And in my opinion, you
ought not to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) up. There are obstacles now; but they may be
done away with in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>persisted Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``I can't help being hopeful about it.
There is something romantic in it,--out of the common way,--just what
everything that happens to you ought to be. And Philip will adore you
like a husband in a fairy tale. Oh, I shall puzzle my small brain to
contrive some plot that will bring everybody into the right mind, so
that you may marry Philip when I marry--somebody else. Wouldn't that
be a pretty ending to all my poor, poor Maggie's troubles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie tried to smile, but shivered, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt a sudden chill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, dear, you are cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``You must go to bed; and so must
I. I dare not think what time it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>They kissed each other, and Lucy went away, possessed of a confidence
which had a strong influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) subsequent impressions. Maggie
had been thoroughly sincere; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nature had never found it easy to be
otherwise. But confidences are sometimes blinding, even when they are
sincere.



<p/>Chapter IV

<p/>Brother and Sister


<p/>Maggie was obliged to go to Tom's lodgings in the middle of the day,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would be coming in to dinner, else she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would not have found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not lodging with entire strangers. Our friend Bob
Jakin had, with Mumps's tacit consent, taken not only a wife about
eight months ago, but also one of those queer old houses, pierced with
surprising passages, by the water-side, where, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) observed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>)
wife and mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting out
two <div class="bookquote">``pleasure-boats,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) had invested some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) savings,
and by taking in a lodger for the parlor and spare bedroom. Under
these circumstances, what could be better for the interests of all
parties, sanitary considerations apart, than that the lodger should be
Mr. Tom?

<p/>It was Bob's wife who opened the door to Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was a tiny woman,
with the general physiognomy of a Dutch doll, looking, in comparison
with Bob's mother, who filled up the passage in the rear, very much
like one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently
standing near a colossal statue to show the proportions. The tiny
woman curtsied and looked up at Maggie with some awe as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had opened the door; but the words, <div class="bookquote">``Is my brother at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which
Maggie uttered smilingly, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turn round with sudden excitement,
and say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, mother, mother--tell Bob!--it's Miss Maggie! Come in, Miss, for
goodness do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, opening a side door, and endeavoring to
flatten her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) person against the wall to make the utmost space for the
visitor.

<p/>Sad recollections crowded on Maggie as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) entered the small parlor,
which was now all that poor Tom had to call by the name of
<div class="bookquote">``home,'' (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>--that name which had once, so many years ago, meant for both
of them the same sum of dear familiar objects. But everything was not
strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in this new room; the first thing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes dwelt on was
the large old Bible, and the sight was not likely to disperse the old
memories. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please to take the privilege o' sitting down, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Jakin, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) apron over a perfectly clean chair, and then
lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) face with
an air of embarrassment, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) looked wonderingly at Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob is at home, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, recovering herself, and smiling
at the bashful Dutch doll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss; but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) must be washing and dressing himself; I'll
go and see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jakin, disappearing.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) presently came back walking with new courage a little way
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) husband, who showed the brilliancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blue eyes and
regular white teeth in the doorway, bowing respectfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, coming forward and putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I always meant to pay your wife a visit, and I shall
come another day on purpose for that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will let me. But I was
obliged to come to-day to speak to my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'ll be in before long, Miss.. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s doin' finely, Mr. Tom is; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll
be one o' the first men hereabouts,--you'll see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bob, I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll be indebted to you, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) becomes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
said so himself only the other night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was talking of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Miss, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) way o' takin' it. But I think the more on't when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) says a thing, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) tongue doesn't overshoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) as mine
does. Lors! I'm no better nor a tilted bottle, I ar'n't,--I can't stop
mysen when once I begin. But you look rarely, Miss; it does me good to
see you. What do you say now, Prissy?'' (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>--here Bob turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
wife,--<div class="bookquote">``Isn't it all come true as I said? Though there isn't many
sorts o' goods as I can't over-praise when I set my tongue to`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bob's small nose seemed to be following the example of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes
in turning up reverentially toward Maggie, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was able now to
smile and curtsey, and say, <div class="bookquote">``I'd looked forrard like aenything to
seein' you, Miss, for my husband's tongue's been runnin' on you, like
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was light-headed, iver since first he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) come a-courtin' on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, looking rather silly. <div class="bookquote">``Go an' see after the
taters, else Mr. Tom `ull have to wait for 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope Mumps is friendly with Mrs. Jakin, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``I remember you used to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wouldn't like your marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mind to't when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) see'd what a
little un she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) pretends not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) mostly, or else to think
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) isn't full-growed. But about Mr. Tom, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, speaking
lower and looking serious, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s as close as a iron biler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is; but
I'm a `cutish chap, an' when I've left off carrying my pack, an' am at
a loose end, I've got more brains nor I know what to do wi', an' I'm
forced to busy myself wi' other folks's insides. An' it worrets me as
Mr. Tom'll sit by himself so glumpish, a-knittin' his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brow, an'
a-lookin' at the fire of a night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should be a bit livelier now, a
fine young fellow like him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). My wife says, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) goes in sometimes,
an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) takes no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sits lookin' into the fire, and
frownin' as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was watchin' folks at work in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thinks so much about business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, speaking lower; <div class="bookquote">``but do you think it's nothin' else,
Miss? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s close, Mr. Tom is; but I'm a `cute chap, I am, an' I
thought tow`rt last Christmas as I'd found out a soft place in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). It
was about a little black spaniel--a rare bit o' breed--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made a
fuss to get. But since then summat's come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s set his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
teeth again' things more nor iver, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s had such good luck.
An' I wanted to tell _you_, Miss, 'cause I thought you might work it
out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a bit, now you're come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a deal too lonely, and doesn't
go into company enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I have very little power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, a
good deal moved by Bob's suggestion. It was a totally new idea to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mind that Tom could have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) love troubles. Poor fellow!--and in love
with Lucy too! But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob's too officious
brain. The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and
gratitude. But Bob had already said, <div class="bookquote">``Here's Mr. Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>and the outer
door was opening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no time to spare, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, as soon as Bob left the
room. <div class="bookquote">``I must tell you at once what I came about, else I shall be
hindering you from taking your dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back against the chimney-piece, and Maggie was
seated opposite the light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was tremulous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had a presentiment of the subject she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was going to speak about. The
presentiment made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice colder and harder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What is
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
request in quite a different form from the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had predetermined
on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seat, and looking straight at Tom, said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem. Or
rather, I promised you not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) without telling you. I am come
to tell you that I wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, still more coldly.

<p/>But Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill, defiant manner,
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) repented, and felt the dread of alienation from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for myself, dear Tom. Don't be angry. I shouldn't have asked it,
only that Philip, you know, is a friend of Lucy's and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wishes him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
to come, has invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to come this evening; and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) I
couldn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) without telling you. I shall only see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in the
presence of other people. There will never be anything secret between
us again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom looked away from Maggie, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brow more strongly for a
little while. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and said, slowly and
emphatically,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what is my feeling on that subject, Maggie. There is no need
for my repeating anything I said a year ago. While my father was
living, I felt bound to use the utmost power over you, to prevent you
from disgracing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as well as yourself, and all of us. But now I must
leave you to your own choice. You wish to be independent; you told me
so after my father's death. My opinion is not changed. If you think of
Philip Wakem as a lover again, you must give up me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish it, dear Tom, at least as things are; I see that it
would lead to misery. But I shall soon go away to another situation,
and I should like to be friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) again while I am here. Lucy
wishes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>The severity of Tom's face relaxed a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind your seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) occasionally at my uncle's--I don't
want you to make a fuss on the subject. But I have no confidence in
you, Maggie. You would be led away to do anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was a cruel word. Maggie's lip began to tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will you say that, Tom? It is very hard of you. Have I not done
and borne everything as well as I could? And I kept my word to
you--when--when--My life has not been a happy one, any more than
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was obliged to be childish; the tears would come. When Maggie was
not angry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on
the sunshine or the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as, in old days, it subdued her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in the worm-eaten attic. The
brother's goodness came uppermost at this appeal, but it could only
show itself in Tom's fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand gently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm, and
said, in the tone of a kind pedagogue,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now listen to me, Maggie. I'll tell you what I mean. You're always in
extremes; you have no judgment and self-command; and yet you think you
know best, and will not submit to be guided. You know I didn't wish
you to take a situation. My aunt Pullet was willing to give you a good
home, and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations,
until I could have provided a home for you with my mother. And that is
what I should like to do. I wished my sister to be a lady, and I
always have taken care of you, as my father desired, until you were
well married. But your ideas and mine never accord, and you will not
give way. Yet you might have sense enough to see that a brother, who
goes out into the world and mixes with men, necessarily knows better
what is right and respectable for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can know
herself. You think I am not kind; but my kindness can only be directed
by what I believe to be good for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a kind pedagogue</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know, dear Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, still half-sobbing, but trying
to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``I know you would do a great deal for me; I know
how you work, and don't spare yourself. I am grateful to you. But,
indeed, you can't quite judge for me; our natures are very different.
You don't know how differently things affect me from what they do
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I _do_ know; I know it too well. I know how differently you must
feel about all that affects our family, and your own dignity as a
young woman, before you could think of receiving secret addresses from
Philip Wakem. If it was not disgusting to me in every other way, I
should object to my sister's name being associated for a moment with
that of a young man whose father must hate the very thought of us all,
and would spurn you. With any one but you, I should think it quite
certain that what you witnessed just before my father's death would
secure you from ever thinking again of Philip Wakem as a lover. But I
don't feel certain of it with you; I never feel certain about anything
with _you_. At one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse
self-denial, and at another you have not resolution to resist a thing
that you know to be wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom's words,--that hard rind of
truth which is discerned by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds. Maggie
always writhed under this judgment of Tom's; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rebelled and was
humiliated in the same moment; it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held a glass before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own folly and weakness, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were a prophetic
voice predicting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) future fallings; and yet, all the while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in return; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said inwardly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was narrow and unjust,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was below feeling those mental needs which were often the
source of the wrong-doing or absurdity that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life a planless
riddle to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not answer directly; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart was too full, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat down,
leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm on the table. It was no use trying to make Tom feel
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) always repelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feeling under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) words was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father and Wakem; and at length that painful, solemn memory
surmounted the immediate grievance. No! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not think of such
things with frivolous indifference, and Tom must not accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of
that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with a grave, earnest gaze and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't make you think better of me, Tom, by anything I can say. But
I am not so shut out from all your feelings as you believe me to be. I
see as well as you do that from our position with regard to Philip's
father--not on other grounds--it would be unreasonable, it would be
wrong, for us to entertain the idea of marriage; and I have given up
thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as a lover. I am telling you the truth, and you have
no right to disbelieve me; I have kept my word to you, and you have
never detected me in a falsehood. I should not only not encourage, I
should carefully avoid, any intercourse with Philip on any other
footing than of quiet friendship. You may think that I am unable to
keep my resolutions; but at least you ought not to treat me with hard
contempt on the ground of faults that I have not committed yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, softening under this appeal, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want
to overstrain matters. I think, all things considered, it will be best
for you to see Philip Wakem, if Lucy wishes him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) to come to the house.
I believe what you say,--at least you believe it yourself, I know; I
can only warn you. I wish to be as good a brother to you as you will
let me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little tremor in Tom's voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uttered the last words,
and Maggie's ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when
they were children, and bit their cake together as a sacrament of
conciliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rose and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand on Tom's shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Tom, I know you mean to be good. I know you have had a great
deal to bear, and have done a great deal. I should like to be a
comfort to you, not to vex you. You don't think I'm altogether
naughty, now, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom smiled at the eager face; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) smiles were very pleasant to see
when they did come, for the gray eyes could be tender underneath the
frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may turn out better than you expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And may I come some day and make tea for you, and see this extremely
small wife of Bob's again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but trot away now, for I've no more time to spare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom,
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to give me a kiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom bent to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek, and then said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! Be a good girl. I've got a great deal to think of to-day. I'm
going to have a long consultation with my uncle Deane this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll come to aunt Glegg's to-morrow? We're going all to dine early,
that we may go there to tea. You _must_ come; Lucy told me to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pooh! I've plenty else to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bell
violently, and bringing down the small bell-rope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm frightened; I shall run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, making a laughing
retreat; while Tom, with masculine philosophy, flung the bell-rope to
the farther end of the room; not very far either,--a touch of human
experience which I flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not
a few substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage
of their rise in the world, and were cherishing very large hopes in
very small lodgings.



<p/>Chapter V

<p/>Showing That Tom Had Opened the Oyster


<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now we've settled this Newcastle business, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane,
that same afternoon, as they were seated in the private room at the
Bank together, <div class="bookquote">``there's another matter I want to talk to you about.
Since you're likely to have rather a smoky, unpleasant time of it at
Newcastle for the next few weeks, you'll want a good prospect of some
sort to keep up your spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom waited less nervously than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had done on a former occasion in
this apartment, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) snuff-box and gratified
each nostril with deliberate impartiality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane at last, throwing himself backward,
<div class="bookquote">``the world goes on at a smarter pace now than it did when I was a
young fellow. Why, sir, forty years ago, when I was much such a
strapping youngster as you, a man expected to pull between the shafts
the best part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got the whip in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. The
looms went slowish, and fashions didn't alter quite so fast; I'd a
best suit that lasted me six years. Everything was on a lower scale,
sir,--in point of expenditure, I mean. It's this steam, you see, that
has made the difference; it drives on every wheel double pace, and the
wheel of fortune along with 'em, as our Mr. Stephen Guest said at the
anniversary dinner -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) hits these things off wonderfully, considering
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)'s seen nothing of business-RRB-. I don't find fault with the change, as
some people do. Trade, sir, opens a man's eyes; and if the population
is to get thicker upon the ground, as it's doing, the world must use
its wits at inventions of one sort or other. I know I've done my share
as an ordinary man of business. Somebody has said it's a fine thing to
make two ears of corn grow where only one grew before; but, sir, it's
a fine thing, too, to further the exchange of commodities, and bring
the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry. And that's our line
of business; and I consider it as honorable a position as a man can
hold, to be connected with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom knew that the affair his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle had to speak of was not urgent; Mr.
Deane was too shrewd and practical a man to allow either his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
reminiscences or his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) snuff to impede the progress of trade. Indeed,
for the last month or two, there had been hints thrown out to Tom
which enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to guess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going to hear some proposition
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own benefit. With the beginning of the last speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) legs, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets, and prepared
himself for some introductory diffuseness, tending to show that Mr.
Deane had succeeded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) own merit, and that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had to say to
young men in general was, that if they didn't succeed too it was
because of their own demerit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) was rather surprised, then, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
uncle put a direct question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see,--it's going on for seven years now since you applied to
me for a situation, eh, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; I'm three-and-twenty now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's as well not to say that, though; for you'd pass for a good
deal older, and age tells well in business. I remember your coming
very well; I remember I saw there was some pluck in you, and that was
what made me give you encouragement. And I'm happy to say I was right;
I'm not often deceived. I was naturally a little shy at pushing my
nephew, but I'm happy to say you've done me credit, sir; and if I'd
had a son o' my own, I shouldn't have been sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) box and opened it again, repeating in a tone of
some feeling, <div class="bookquote">``No, I shouldn't have been sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad I've given you satisfaction, sir; I've done my best,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) proud, independent way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Tom, you've given me satisfaction. I don't speak of your conduct
as a son; though that weighs with me in my opinion of you. But what I
have to do with, as a partner in our firm, is the qualities you've
shown as a man o' business. Ours is a fine business,--a splendid
concern, sir,--and there's no reason why it shouldn't go on growing;
there's a growing capital, and growing outlets for it; but there's
another thing that's wanted for the prosperity of every concern, large
or small, and that's men to conduct it,--men of the right habits; none
o' your flashy fellows, but such as are to be depended on. Now this is
what Mr. Guest and I see clear enough. Three years ago we took Gell
into the concern; we gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gell</b></font>) a share in the oil-mill. And why? Why,
because Gell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium. So it
will always be, sir. So it was with me. And though Gell is pretty near
ten years older than you, there are other points in your favor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was getting a little nervous as Mr. Deane went on speaking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) was
conscious of something he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) mind to say, which might not be
agreeable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) uncle, simply because it was a new suggestion rather
than an acceptance of the proposition he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) foresaw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It stands to reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>Mr. Deane went on, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) new
pinch, <div class="bookquote">``that your being my nephew weighs in your favor; but I don't
deny that if you'd been no relation of mine at all, your conduct in
that affair of Pelley's bank would have led Mr. Guest and myself to
make some acknowledgment of the service you've been to us; and, backed
by your general conduct and business ability, it has made us determine
on giving you a share in the business,--a share which we shall be glad
to increase as the years go on. We think that'll be better, on all
grounds, than raising your salary. It'll give you more importance, and
prepare you better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by
and by. I'm equal to a good deal o' work at present, thank God; but
I'm getting older,--there's no denying that. I told Mr. Guest I would
open the subject to you; and when you come back from this northern
business, we can go into particulars. This is a great stride for a
young fellow of three-and-twenty, but I'm bound to say you've deserved
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very grateful to Mr. Guest and you, sir; of course I feel the
most indebted to _you_, who first took me into the business, and have
taken a good deal of pains with me since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom spoke with a slight tremor, and paused after he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had said this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane. <div class="bookquote">``I don't spare pains when I see they'll be
of any use. I gave myself some trouble with Gell, else he (<font color='blue'><b>Gell</b></font>) wouldn't
have been what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gell</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's one thing I should like to mention to you uncle. I've
never spoken to you of it before. If you remember, at the time my
father's property was sold, there was some thought of your firm buying
the Mill; I know you thought it would be a very good investment,
especially if steam were applied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, to be sure. But Wakem outbid us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'d made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) mind to
that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s rather fond of carrying everything over other people's
heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it's of no use my mentioning it at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom went on,
<div class="bookquote">``but I wish you to know what I have in my mind about the Mill. I've a
strong feeling about it. It was my father's dying wish that I should
try and get it back again whenever I could; it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family for
five generations. I promised my father; and besides that, I'm attached
to the place. I shall never like any other so well. And if it should
ever suit your views to buy it for the firm, I should have a better
chance of fulfilling my father's wish. I shouldn't have liked to
mention the thing to you, only you've been kind enough to say my
services have been of some value. And I'd give up a much greater
chance in life for the sake of having the Mill again,--I mean having
it in my own hands, and gradually working off the price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Deane had listened attentively, and now looked thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) said, after a while; <div class="bookquote">``the thing would be possible
if there were any chance of Wakem's parting with the property. But
that I _don't_ see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s put that young Jetsome in the place; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) reasons when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) bought it, I'll be bound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s a loose fish, that young Jetsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s taking to
drinking, and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s letting the business go down. Luke told me
about it,--our old miller. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) sha'n't stay unless there's an
alteration. I was thinking, if things went on that way, Wakem might be
more willing to part with the Mill. Luke says he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s getting very sour
about the way things are going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll turn it over, Tom. I must inquire into the matter, and go
into it with Mr. Guest. But, you see, it's rather striking out a new
branch, and putting you to that, instead of keeping you where you are,
which was what we'd wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be able to manage more than the Mill when things were once
set properly going, sir. I want to have plenty of work. There's
nothing else I care about much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something rather sad in that speech from a young man of
three-and-twenty, even in uncle Deane's business-loving ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh! you'll be having a wife to care about one of these days,
if you get on at this pace in the world. But as to this Mill, we
mustn't reckon on our chickens too early. However, I promise you to
bear it in mind, and when you come back we'll talk of it again. I am
going to dinner now. Come and breakfast with us to-morrow morning, and
say good-bye to your mother and sister before you start.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter VI

<p/>Illustrating the Laws of Attraction

<p/>It is evident to you now that Maggie had arrived at a moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
life which must be considered by all prudent persons as a great
opportunity for a young woman. Launched into the higher society of St.
Ogg's, with a striking person, which had the advantage of being quite
unfamiliar to the majority of beholders, and with such moderate
assistance of costume as you have seen foreshadowed in Lucy's anxious
colloquy with aunt Pullet, Maggie was certainly at a new
starting-point in life. At Lucy's first evening party, young Torry
fatigued his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) facial muscles more than usual in order that <div class="bookquote">``the
dark-eyed girl there in the corner''  (<font color='red'><b>Torry/Miss Torry</b></font>)</div>might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) in all the
additional style conferred by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) eyeglass; and several young ladies
went home intending to have short sleeves with black lace, and to
plait their hair in a broad coronet at the back of their head,--<div class="bookquote">``That
cousin of Miss Deane's looked so very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>In fact, poor Maggie,
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inward consciousness of a painful past and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
presentiment of a troublous future, was on the way to become an object
of some envy,--a topic of discussion in the newly established
billiard-room, and between fair friends who had no secrets from each
other on the subject of trimmings. The Miss Guests, who associated
chiefly on terms of condescension with the families of St. Ogg's, and
were the glass of fashion there, took some exception to Maggie's
manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a way of not assenting at once to the observations
current in good society, and of saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't know whether
those observations were true or not, which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) an air of
_gaucherie_, and impeded the even flow of conversation; but it is a
fact capable of an amiable interpretation that ladies are not the
worst disposed toward a new acquaintance of their own sex because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
has points of inferiority. And Maggie was so entirely without those
pretty airs of coquetry which have the traditional reputation of
driving gentlemen to despair that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) won some feminine pity for being
so ineffective in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not had many
advantages, poor thing! and it must be admitted there was no
pretension about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) abruptness and unevenness of manner were
plainly the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) secluded and lowly circumstances. It was
only a wonder that there was no tinge of vulgarity about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
considering what the rest of poor Lucy's relations were--an allusion
which always made the Miss Guests shudder a little. It was not
agreeable to think of any connection by marriage with such people as
the Gleggs and the Pullets; but it was of no use to contradict Stephen
when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) mind on anything, and certainly there was no
possible objection to Lucy in herself,--no one could help liking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would naturally desire that the Miss Guests should behave kindly
to this cousin of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was so fond, and Stephen would make a great
fuss if they were deficient in civility. Under these circumstances the
invitations to Park House were not wanting; and elsewhere, also, Miss
Deane was too popular and too distinguished a member of society in St.
Ogg's for any attention toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) to be neglected.

<p/>Thus Maggie was introduced for the first time to the young lady's
life, and knew what it was to get up in the morning without any
imperative reason for doing one thing more than another. This new
sense of leisure and unchecked enjoyment amidst the soft-breathing
airs and garden-scents of advancing spring--amidst the new abundance
of music, and lingering strolls in the sunshine, and the delicious
dreaminess of gliding on the river--could hardly be without some
intoxicating effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) years of privation; and even in
the first week Maggie began to be less haunted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sad memories and
anticipations. Life was certainly very pleasant just now; it was
becoming very pleasant to dress in the evening, and to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was one of the beautiful things of this spring-time. And there were
admiring eyes always awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was no longer an unheeded
person, liable to be chid, from whom attention was continually
claimed, and on whom no one felt bound to confer any. It was pleasant,
too, when Stephen and Lucy were gone out riding, to sit down at the
piano alone, and find that the old fitness between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fingers and the
keys remained, and revived, like a sympathetic kinship not to be worn
out by separation; to get the tunes she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had heard the evening before,
and repeat them again and again until she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had found out a way of
producing them so as to make them a more pregnant, passionate language
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). The mere concord of octaves was a delight to Maggie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
would often take up a book of studies rather than any melody, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might taste more keenly by abstraction the more primitive sensation of
intervals. Not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) enjoyment of music was of the kind that
indicates a great specific talent; it was rather that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sensibility
to the supreme excitement of music was only one form of that
passionate sensibility which belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whole nature, and made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) faults and virtues all merge in each other; made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) affections
sometimes an impatient demand, but also prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) vanity from
taking the form of mere feminine coquetry and device, and gave it the
poetry of ambition. But you have known Maggie a long while, and need
to be told, not her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) characteristics, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) history, which is a thing
hardly to be predicted even from the completest knowledge of
characteristics. For the tragedy of our lives is not created entirely
from within. <div class="bookquote">``Character,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Novalis, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) questionable
aphorisms,--<div class="bookquote">``character is destiny.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But not the whole of our destiny.
Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was speculative and irresolute, and we have
a great tragedy in consequence. But if his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father had lived to a good
old age, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) uncle had died an early death, we can conceive
Hamlet's having married Ophelia, and got through life with a
reputation of sanity, notwithstanding many soliloquies, and some moody
sarcasms toward the fair daughter of Polonius, to say nothing of the
frankest incivility to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father-in-law.

<p/>Maggie's destiny, then, is at present hidden, and we must wait for it
to reveal itself like the course of an unmapped river; we only know
that the river is full and rapid, and that for all rivers there is the
same final home. Under the charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) new pleasures, Maggie herself
was ceasing to think, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eager prefiguring imagination, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
future lot; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) first interview with Philip was
losing its predominance; perhaps, unconsciously to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
not sorry that the interview had been deferred.

<p/>For Philip had not come the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was expected, and Mr. Stephen
Guest brought word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) was gone to the coast,--probably, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)
thought, on a sketching expedition; but it was not certain when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)
would return. It was just like Philip, to go off in that way without
telling any one. It was not until the twelfth day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) returned, to
find both Lucy's notes awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had left before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knew of
Maggie's arrival.

<p/>Perhaps one had need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of the
feelings that were crowded for Maggie into those twelve days; of the
length to which they were stretched for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by the novelty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
experience in them, and the varying attitudes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind. The early
days of an acquaintance almost always have this importance for us, and
fill up a larger space in our memory than longer subsequent periods,
which have been less filled with discovery and new impressions. There
were not many hours in those ten days in which Mr. Stephen Guest was
not seated by Lucy's side, or standing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at the piano, or
accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on some outdoor excursion; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) attentions were
clearly becoming more assiduous, and that was what every one had
expected. Lucy was very happy, all the happier because Stephen's
society seemed to have become much more interesting and amusing since
Maggie had been there. Playful discussions--sometimes serious
ones--were going forward, in which both Stephen and Maggie revealed
themselves, to the admiration of the gentle, unobtrusive Lucy; and it
more than once crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind what a charming quartet they should
have through life when Maggie married Philip. Is it an inexplicable
thing that a girl should enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lover's society the more for the
presence of a third person, and be without the slightest spasm of
jealousy that the third person had the conversation habitually
directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)? Not when that girl is as tranquil-hearted as Lucy,
thoroughly possessed with a belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knows the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
companions' affections, and not prone to the feelings which shake such
a belief in the absence of positive evidence against it. Besides, it
was Lucy by whom Stephen sat, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
appealed as the person sure to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>); and every day there was
the same tender politeness toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), the same consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
wants and care to supply them. Was there really the same? It seemed to
Lucy that there was more; and it was no wonder that the real
significance of the change escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). It was a subtle act of
conscience in Stephen that even he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) himself was not aware of. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
personal attentions to Maggie were comparatively slight, and there had
even sprung up an apparent distance between them, that prevented the
renewal of that faint resemblance to gallantry into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had
fallen the first day in the boat. If Stephen came in when Lucy was out
of the room, if Lucy left them together, they never spoke to each
other; Stephen, perhaps, seemed to be examining books or music, and
Maggie bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head assiduously over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work. Each was oppressively
conscious of the other's presence, even to the finger-ends. Yet each
looked and longed for the same thing to happen the next day. Neither
of them had begun to reflect on the matter, or silently to ask, <div class="bookquote">``To
what does all this tend?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie only felt that life was revealing
something quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was absorbed in the direct,
immediate experience, without any energy left for taking account of it
and reasoning about it. Stephen wilfully abstained from
self-questioning, and would not admit to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) felt an
influence which was to have any determining effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) conduct. And
when Lucy came into the room again, they were once more unconstrained;
Maggie could contradict Stephen, and laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could
recommend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consideration the example of that most charming
heroine, Miss Sophia Western, who had a great <div class="bookquote">``respect for the
understandings of men.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div>Maggie could look at Stephen, which, for some
reason or other she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) always avoided when they were alone; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could
even ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to play his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) accompaniment for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), since Lucy's fingers
were so busy with that bazaar-work, and lecture her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on hurrying the
tempo, which was certainly Maggie's weak point.

<p/>One day--it was the day of Philip's return--Lucy had formed a sudden
engagement to spend the evening with Mrs. Kenn, whose delicate state
of health, threatening to become confirmed illness through an attack
of bronchitis, obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) functions at the coming
bazaar into the hands of other ladies, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wished Lucy to be
one. The engagement had been formed in Stephen's presence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had
heard Lucy promise to dine early and call at six o'clock for Miss
Torry, who brought Mrs. Kenn's request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is another of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>Stephen
burst forth, as soon as Miss Torry had left the room,--<div class="bookquote">``taking young
ladies from the duties of the domestic hearth into scenes of
dissipation among urn-rugs and embroidered reticules! I should like to
know what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make
reasons for husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for
bachelors to go out. If this goes on much longer, the bonds of society
will be dissolved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Torry/Miss Torry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it will not go on much longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``for the
bazaar is to take place on Monday week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">``Kenn himself said the other day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
didn't like this plan of making vanity do the work of charity; but
just as the British public is not reasonable enough to bear direct
taxation, so St. Ogg's has not got force of motive enough to build and
endow schools without calling in the force of folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said little Lucy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hazel eyes opening wide with
anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) say anything of that kind; I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>)
approved of what we were doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) approves _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
affectionately; <div class="bookquote">``your conduct in going out to-night looks vicious, I
own, but I know there is benevolence at the bottom of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you think too well of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head, with a
pretty blush, and there the subject ended. But it was tacitly
understood that Stephen would not come in the evening; and on the
strength of that tacit understanding he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) morning visit the
longer, not saying good-bye until after four.

<p/>Maggie was seated in the drawing-room, alone, shortly after dinner,
with Minny on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lap, having left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) uncle to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wine and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) nap,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother to the compromise between knitting and nodding, which,
when there was no company, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) always carried on in the dining-room
till tea-time. Maggie was stooping to caress the tiny silken pet, and
comforting him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mistress's absence, when the sound of a
footstep on the gravel made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) look up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw Mr. Stephen Guest
walking up the garden, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) had come straight from the river. It
was very unusual to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) so soon after dinner! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) often complained
that their dinner-hour was late at Park House. Nevertheless, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)
was, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) black dress; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) had evidently been home, and must have
come again by the river. Maggie felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheeks glowing and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart
beating; it was natural she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should be nervous, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not
accustomed to receive visitors alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) look up through
the open window, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) hat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) walked toward it, to enter
that way instead of by the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) blushed too, and certainly looked
as foolish as a young man of some wit and self-possession can be
expected to look, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked in with a roll of music in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand,
and said, with an air of hesitating improvisation,--

<p/>``You are surprised to see me again, Miss Tulliver; I ought to
apologize for coming upon you by surprise, but I wanted to come into
the town, and I got our man to row me; so I thought I would bring
these things from the <div class="bookquote">``Maid of Artois' for your cousin; I forgot them
this morning. Will you give them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maid</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, who had risen confusedly with Minny in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms,
and now, not quite knowing what else to do, sat down again.

<p/>Stephen laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hat, with the music, which rolled on the floor,
and sat down in the chair close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had never done so before,
and both he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) and Maggie were quite aware that it was an entirely new
position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you pampered minion!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, leaning to pull the long
curly ears that drooped over Maggie's arm. It was not a suggestive
remark, and as the speaker did not follow it up by further
development, it naturally left the conversation at a standstill. It
seemed to Stephen like some action in a dream that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was obliged to
do, and wonder at himself all the while,--to go on stroking Minny's
head. Yet it was very pleasant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) only wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) dared look at
Maggie, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>),--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) have one long look
into those deep, strange eyes of hers, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would be satisfied
and quite reasonable after that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thought it was becoming a sort of
monomania with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), to want that long look from Maggie; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was
racking his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) invention continually to find out some means by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
could have it without its appearing singular and entailing subsequent
embarrassment. As for Maggie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no distinct thought, only the
sense of a presence like that of a closely hovering broad-winged bird
in the darkness, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was unable to look up, and saw nothing but
Minny's black wavy coat.

<p/>But this must end some time, perhaps it ended very soon, and only
_seemed_ long, as a minute's dream does. Stephen at last sat upright
sideways in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chair, leaning one hand and arm over the back and
looking at Maggie. What should he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) say?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have a splendid sunset, I think; sha'n't you go out and see
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. Then courageously raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes and
looking out of the window, <div class="bookquote">``if I'm not playing cribbage with my
uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A pause; during which Minny is stroked again, but has sufficient
insight not to be grateful for it, to growl rather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like sitting alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>A rather arch look came over Maggie's face, and, just glancing at
Stephen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Would it be quite civil to say `yes'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It _was_ rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said
Stephen, delighted with that glance, and getting determined to stay
for another. <div class="bookquote">``But you will have more than half an hour to yourself
after I am gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) added, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``I know Mr. Deane
never comes in till half-past seven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Another pause, during which Maggie looked steadily out of the window,
till by a great effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head to look down at Minny's back
again, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Lucy had not been obliged to go out. We lose our music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Minny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have a new voice to-morrow night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">``Will you
tell your cousin that our friend Philip Wakem is come back? I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
as I went home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie gave a little start,--it seemed hardly more than a vibration
that passed from head to foot in an instant. But the new images
summoned by Philip's name dispersed half the oppressive spell she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
been under. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair with a sudden resolution, and
laying Minny on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cushion, went to reach Lucy's large work-basket
from its corner. Stephen was vexed and disappointed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thought
perhaps Maggie didn't like the name of Wakem to be mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in
that abrupt way, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) now recalled what Lucy had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) of the
family quarrel. It was of no use to stay any longer. Maggie was
seating herself at the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work, and looking chill and
proud; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) looked like a simpleton for having come. A
gratuitous, entirely superfluous visit of that sort was sure to make a
man disagreeable and ridiculous. Of course it was palpable to Maggie's
thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had dined hastily in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own room for the sake of
setting off again and finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) alone.

<p/>A boyish state of mind for an accomplished young gentleman of
five-and-twenty, not without legal knowledge! But a reference to
history, perhaps, may make it not incredible.

<p/>At this moment Maggie's ball of knitting-wool rolled along the ground,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) started up to reach it. Stephen rose too, and picking up the
ball, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with a vexed, complaining look that gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) eyes quite
a new expression to Maggie, whose own eyes met them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) presented
the ball to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, in a tone that had the same beseeching
discontent as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) dared not put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thrust both
hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) tail-pockets as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) spoke. Maggie thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
perhaps been rude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you stay?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said timidly, not looking away, for that would
have seemed rude again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, looking still into the half-unwilling,
half-fascinated eyes, as a thirsty man looks toward the track of the
distant brook. <div class="bookquote">``The boat is waiting for me. You'll tell your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I brought the music, I mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that Philip is come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Maggie did not notice Philip's name this time.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you come out a little way into the garden?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, in a
still gentler tone; but the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was vexed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not
say <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moved away now toward the open window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was
obliged to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hat and walk by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thought of
something to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) amends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do take my arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, in a low tone, as if it were a secret.

<p/>There is something strangely winning to most women in that offer of
the firm arm; the help is not wanted physically at that moment, but
the sense of help, the presence of strength that is outside them and
yet theirs, meets a continual want of the imagination. Either on that
ground or some other, Maggie took the arm. And they walked together
round the grassplot and under the drooping green of the laburnums, in
the same dim, dreamy state as they had been in a quarter of an hour
before; only that Stephen had had the look he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) longed for, without yet
perceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness, and
Maggie had darting thoughts across the dimness,--how came he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) to be
there? Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) come out? Not a word was spoken. If it had been,
each would have been less intensely conscious of the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care of this step,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will go in now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, feeling that the step had come
like a rescue. <div class="bookquote">``Good-evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had withdrawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm, and was running back to the
house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not reflect that this sudden action would only add to
the embarrassing recollections of the last half-hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no
thought left for that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) only threw herself into the low arm-chair,
and burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Philip, Philip, I wish we were together again--so quietly--in the
Red Deeps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a moment, then went on to the boat, and was
soon landed at the wharf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) spent the evening in the billiard-room,
smoking one cigar after another, and losing <div class="bookquote">``lives''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>at pool. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
would not leave off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was determined not to think,--not to admit any
more distinct remembrance than was urged upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) by the perpetual
presence of Maggie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm.

<p/>But there came the necessity of walking home in the cool starlight,
and with it the necessity of cursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own folly, and bitterly
determining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would never trust himself alone with Maggie again.
It was all madness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was in love, thoroughly attached to Lucy, and
engaged,--engaged as strongly as an honorable man need be. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never seen this Maggie Tulliver, to be thrown into a fever by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) in this way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would make a sweet, strange, troublesome,
adorable wife to some man or other, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never have chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
himself. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) feel as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) did--not. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not
to have gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would master himself in future. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make himself
disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) perhaps. Quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)? Was
it possible to quarrel with a creature who had such eyes,--defying and
deprecating, contradicting and clinging, imperious and beseeching,--
full of delicious opposites? To see such a creature subdued by love
for one would be a lot worth having--to another man.

<p/>There was a muttered exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy, as
Stephen threw away the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) last cigar, and thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hands
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) pockets, stalked along at a quieter pace through the
shrubbery. It was not of a benedictory kind.



<p/>Chapter VII

<p/>Philip Re-enters


<p/>The next morning was very wet,--the sort of morning on which male
neighbors who have no imperative occupation at home are likely to pay
their fair friends an illimitable visit. The rain, which has been
endurable enough for the walk or ride one way, is sure to become so
heavy, and at the same time so certain to clear up by and by, that
nothing but an open quarrel can abbreviate the visit; latent
detestation will not do at all. And if people happen to be lovers,
what can be so delightful, in England, as a rainy morning? English
sunshine is dubious; bonnets are never quite secure; and if you sit
down on the grass, it may lead to catarrhs. But the rain is to be
depended on. You gallop through it in a mackintosh, and presently find
yourself in the seat you like best,--a little above or a little below
the one on which your goddess sits -LRB-it is the same thing to the
metaphysical mind, and that is the reason why women are at once
worshipped and looked down upon-RRB-, with a satisfactory confidence that
there will be no lady-callers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stephen will come earlier this morning, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
always does when it's rainy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was angry with Stephen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>); and if it had not been for the rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would
have gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Glegg's this morning, and so have avoided him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
altogether. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must find some reason for remaining out of
the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother.

<p/>But Stephen did not come earlier, and there was another visitor--a
nearer neighbor--who preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). When Philip entered the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was going merely to bow to Maggie, feeling that their acquaintance was
a secret which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was bound not to betray; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) advanced
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) guessed at once that Lucy had been
taken into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) confidence. It was a moment of some agitation to both,
though Philip had spent many hours in preparing for it; but like all
persons who have passed through life with little expectation of
sympathy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seldom lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) self-control, and shrank with the most
sensitive pride from any noticeable betrayal of emotion. A little
extra paleness, a little tension of the nostril when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke, and the
voice pitched in rather a higher key, that to strangers would seem
expressive of cold indifference, were all the signs Philip usually
gave of an inward drama that was not without its fierceness. But
Maggie, who had little more power of concealing the impressions made
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been constructed of musical strings, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
eyes getting larger with tears as they took each other's hands in
silence. They were not painful tears; they had rather something of the
same origin as the tears women and children shed when they have found
some protection to cling to and look back on the threatened danger.
For Philip, who a little while ago was associated continually in
Maggie's mind with the sense that Tom might reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with some
justice, had now, in this short space, become a sort of outward
conscience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might fly to for rescue and strength. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
tranquil, tender affection for Philip, with its root deep down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
childhood, and its memories of long quiet talk confirming by distinct
successive impressions the first instinctive bias,--the fact that in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the appeal was more strongly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pity and womanly devotedness
than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) vanity or other egoistic excitability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
nature,--seemed now to make a sort of sacred place, a sanctuary where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could find refuge from an alluring influence which the best part
of herself must resist; which must bring horrible tumult within,
wretchedness without. This new sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) relation to Philip
nullified the anxious scruples she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would otherwise have felt, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
should overstep the limit of intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that Tom would
sanction; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and felt the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
eyes without any consciousness of an inward check. The scene was just
what Lucy expected, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) kind heart delighted in bringing Philip
and Maggie together again; though, even with all _her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ regard for
Philip, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could not resist the impression that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cousin Tom had
some excuse for feeling shocked at the physical incongruity between
the two,--a prosaic person like cousin Tom, who didn't like poetry and
fairy tales. But she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) began to speak as soon as possible, to set them
at ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This was very good and virtuous of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) pretty
treble, like the low conversational notes of little birds, <div class="bookquote">``to come so
soon after your arrival. And as it is, I think I will pardon you for
running away in an inopportune manner, and giving your friends no
notice. Come and sit down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) went on, placing the chair that
would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) best, <div class="bookquote">``and you shall find yourself treated mercifully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never govern well, Miss Deane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seated
himself, <div class="bookquote">``because no one will ever believe in your severity. People
will always encourage themselves in misdemeanors by the certainty that
you will be indulgent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy gave some playful contradiction, but Philip did not hear what it
was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had naturally turned toward Maggie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with that open, affectionate scrutiny which we give to a friend
from whom we have been long separated. What a moment their parting had
been! And Philip felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) were only in the morrow of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt
this so keenly,--with such intense, detailed remembrance, with such
passionate revival of all that had been said and looked in their last
conversation,--that with that jealousy and distrust which in diffident
natures is almost inevitably linked with a strong feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) read in Maggie's glance and manner the evidence of a change. The
very fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feared and half expected it would be sure to make
this thought rush in, in the absence of positive proof to the
contrary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am having a great holiday, am I not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy is like a
fairy godmother; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has turned me from a drudge into a princess in no
time. I do nothing but indulge myself all day long, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) always
finds out what I want before I know it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is the happier for having you, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``You
must be better than a whole menagerie of pets to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). And you look
well. You are benefiting by the change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Artificial conversation of this sort went on a little while, till
Lucy, determined to put an end to it, exclaimed, with a good imitation
of annoyance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had forgotten something, and was quickly out of
the room.

<p/>In a moment Maggie and Philip leaned forward, and the hands were
clasped again, with a look of sad contentment, like that of friends
who meet in the memory of recent sorrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told my brother I wished to see you, Philip; I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to release
me from my promise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) consented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) impulsiveness, wanted Philip to know at once the
position they must hold toward each other; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) checked herself.
The things that had happened since he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
were so painful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shrank from being the first to allude to them.
It seemed almost like an injury toward Philip even to mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
brother,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother, who had insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was thinking too
entirely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to be sensitive on any other point at that moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we can at least be friends, Maggie? There is nothing to hinder
that now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will not your father object?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not give you up on any ground but your own wish, Maggie,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, coloring. <div class="bookquote">``There are points on which I should always
resist my father, as I used to tell you. _That_ is one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there is nothing to hinder our being friends, Philip,--seeing
each other and talking to each other while I am here; I shall soon go
away again. I mean to go very soon, to a new situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that inevitable, Maggie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I must not stay here long. It would unfit me for the life I must
begin again at last. I can't live in dependence,--I can't live with my
brother, though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very good to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would like to provide for
me; but that would be intolerable to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip was silent a few moments, and then said, in that high, feeble
voice which with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) indicated the resolute suppression of emotion,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no other alternative, Maggie? Is that life, away from those
who love you, the only one you will allow yourself to look forward
to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pleadingly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was compelled to this course. <div class="bookquote">``At
least, as things are; I don't know what may be in years to come. But I
begin to think there can never come much happiness to me from loving;
I have always had so much pain mingled with it. I wish I could make
myself a world outside it, as men do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are returning to your old thought in a new form, Maggie,--the
thought I used to combat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, with a slight tinge of
bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``You want to find out a mode of renunciation that will be
an escape from pain. I tell you again, there is no such escape
possible except by perverting or mutilating one's nature. What would
become of me, if I tried to escape from pain? Scorn and cynicism would
be my only opium; unless I could fall into some kind of conceited
madness, and fancy myself a favorite of Heaven because I am not a
favorite with men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>The bitterness had taken on some impetuosity as Philip went on
speaking; the words were evidently an outlet for some immediate
feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own, as well as an answer to Maggie. There was a pain
pressing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at that moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shrank with proud delicacy from the
faintest allusion to the words of love, of plighted love that had
passed between them. It would have seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) like reminding Maggie
of a promise; it would have had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) something of the baseness of
compulsion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not dwell on the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) himself had not
changed; for that too would have had the air of an appeal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love
for Maggie was stamped, even more than the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) experience,
with the exaggerated sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was an exception,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that
every one, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in the light of an exception.

<p/>But Maggie was conscience-stricken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) childish contrition when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) used to
chide her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are right, I know. I do always think too much of my
own feelings, and not enough of others',--not enough of yours. I had
need have you always to find fault with me and teach me; so many
things have come true that you used to tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) elbow on the table, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand and looking at Philip with half-penitent dependent affection, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said this; while he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was returning her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gaze with an expression
that, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consciousness, gradually became less vague,--became
charged with a specific recollection. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind flown back to
something that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ now remembered,--something about a lover of
Lucy's? It was a thought that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shudder; it gave new
definiteness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) present position, and to the tendency of what had
happened the evening before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arm from the table, urged
to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) position by that positive physical oppression at the
heart that sometimes accompanies a sudden mental pang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, Maggie? Has something happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>Philip said, in
inexpressible anxiety, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) imagination being only too ready to weave
everything that was fatal to them both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, rousing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) latent will. Philip must not
have that odious thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would banish it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
own. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``except in my own mind. You used to say
I should feel the effect of my starved life, as you called it; and I
do. I am too eager in my enjoyment of music and all luxuries, now they
are come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work and occupied herself resolutely, while Philip
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), really in doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had anything more than this
general allusion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind. It was quite in Maggie's character to be
agitated by vague self-reproach. But soon there came a violent
well-known ring at the door-bell resounding through the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a startling announcement!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, quite mistress of
herself, though not without some inward flutter. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder where Lucy
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy had not been deaf to the signal, and after an interval long
enough for a few solicitous but not hurried inquiries, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) herself
ushered Stephen in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, going straight up to Philip and shaking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) heartily by the hand, bowing to Maggie in passing, <div class="bookquote">``it's glorious
to have you back again; only I wish you'd conduct yourself a little
less like a sparrow with a residence on the house-top, and not go in
and out constantly without letting the servants know. This is about
the twentieth time I've had to scamper up those countless stairs to
that painting-room of yours, all to no purpose, because your people
thought you were at home. Such incidents embitter friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've so few visitors, it seems hardly worth while to leave notice of
my exit and entrances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, feeling rather oppressed just
then by Stephen's bright strong presence and strong voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite well this morning, Miss Tulliver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen,
turning to Maggie with stiff politeness, and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand with
the air of fulfilling a social duty.

<p/>Maggie gave the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fingers, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Quite well, thank
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>in a tone of proud indifference. Philip's eyes were watching
them keenly; but Lucy was used to seeing variations in their manner to
each other, and only thought with regret that there was some natural
antipathy which every now and then surmounted their mutual good-will.
<div class="bookquote">``Maggie is not the sort of woman Stephen admires, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is irritated
by something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) interprets as conceit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>was the silent
observation that accounted for everything to guileless Lucy. Stephen
and Maggie had no sooner completed this studied greeting than each
felt hurt by the other's coldness. And Stephen, while rattling on in
questions to Philip about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) recent sketching expedition, was
thinking all the more about Maggie because he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was not drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into
the conversation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had invariably done before. <div class="bookquote">``Maggie and Philip
are not looking happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>thought Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``this first interview has been
saddening to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we people who have not been galloping,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said to Stephen,
``are all a little damped by the rain. Let us have some music. We ought
to take advantage of having Philip and you together. Give us the duet
in <div class="bookquote">``Masaniello'; Maggie has not heard that, and I know it will suit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, going toward the piano, and giving a
foretaste of the tune in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) deep <div class="bookquote">``brum-brum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>very pleasant to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, please, Philip,--you play the accompaniment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``and
then I can go on with my work. You _will_ like to play, sha'n't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) added, with a pretty, inquiring look, anxious, as usual, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
should have proposed what was not pleasant to another; but with
yearnings toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) unfinished embroidery.

<p/>Philip had brightened at the proposition, for there is no feeling,
perhaps, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find
relief in music,--that does not make a man sing or play the better;
and Philip had an abundance of pent-up feeling at this moment, as
complex as any trio or quartet that was ever meant to express love and
jealousy and resignation and fierce suspicion, all at the same time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, seating himself at the piano, <div class="bookquote">``it is a way of
eking out one's imperfect life and being three people at once,--to
sing and make the piano sing, and hear them both all the while,--or
else to sing and paint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there you are an enviable fellow. I can do nothing with my
hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">``That has generally been observed in men of
great administrative capacity, I believe,--a tendency to predominance
of the reflective powers in me! Haven't you observed that, Miss
Tulliver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen had fallen by mistake into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) habit of playful appeal to
Maggie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could not repress the answering flush and epigram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I _have_ observed a tendency to predominance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, smiling; and
Philip at that moment devoutly hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found the tendency
disagreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``music, music! We will discuss each other's
qualities another time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie always tried in vain to go on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work when music began.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tried harder than ever to-day; for the thought that Stephen knew
how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) singing was one that no longer roused a
merely playful resistance; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew, too, that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) habit
always to stand so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But it was of no use;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soon threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work down, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) intentions were lost in the
vague state of emotion produced by the inspiring duet,--emotion that
seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at once strong and weak; strong for all enjoyment,
weak for all resistance. When the strain passed into the minor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
half started from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seat with the sudden thrill of that change. Poor
Maggie! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked very beautiful when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soul was being played on in
this way by the inexorable power of sound. You might have seen the
slightest perceptible quivering through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whole frame as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leaned
a little forward, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands as if to steady herself; while
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes dilated and brightened into that wide-open, childish
expression of wondering delight which always came back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) happiest
moments. Lucy, who at other times had always been at the piano when
Maggie was looking in this way, could not resist the impulse to steal
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Philip, too, caught a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now and
then round the open book on the desk, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had never
before seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) under so strong an influence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More, more!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, when the duet had been encored. <div class="bookquote">``Something
spirited again. Maggie always says she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) likes a great rush of sound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It must be ``Let us take the road,<div class="bookquote">'' then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen,--<div class="bookquote">``so suitable
for a wet morning. But are you prepared to abandon the most sacred
duties of life, and come and sing with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, laughing. ``If you will look out the <div class="bookquote">``Beggar's
Opera' from the large canterbury. It has a dingy cover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a great clue, considering there are about a score covers here
of rival dinginess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, drawing out the canterbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, play something the while, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, noticing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
fingers were wandering over the keys. <div class="bookquote">``What is that you are falling
into?--something delicious that I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, bringing out the tune more
definitely. ``It's from the ``Sonnambula'--`Ah! perchè non posso
odiarti.'' I don't know the opera, but it appears the tenor is telling
the heroine that he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) shall always love her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) though she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) may forsake him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>).
You've heard me sing it to the English words, <div class="bookquote">``I love thee still.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not quite unintentionally that Philip had wandered into this
song, which might be an indirect expression to Maggie of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
not prevail on himself to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) directly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ears had been open
to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was saying, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began to sing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) understood the
plaintive passion of the music. That pleading tenor had no very fine
qualities as a voice, but it was not quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); it had sung to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by snatches, in a subdued way, among the grassy walks and hollows,
and underneath the leaning ash-tree in the Red Deeps. There seemed to
be some reproach in the words; did Philip mean that? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) more distinctly in their conversation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) desired
not to renew the hope of love between them, _only_ because it clashed
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inevitable circumstances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was touched, not thrilled by
the song; it suggested distinct memories and thoughts, and brought
quiet regret in the place of excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way with you tenors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, who was waiting with
music in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand while Philip finished the song. <div class="bookquote">``You demoralize the
fair sex by warbling your sentimental love and constancy under all
sorts of vile treatment. Nothing short of having your heads served up
in a dish like that mediæval tenor or troubadour, would prevent you
from expressing your entire resignation. I must administer an
antidote, while Miss Deane prepares to tear herself away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
bobbins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen rolled out, with saucy energy,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I, wasting in despair,
Die because a woman's fair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>and seemed to make all the air in the room alive with a new influence.
Lucy, always proud of what Stephen did, went toward the piano with
laughing, admiring looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>); and Maggie, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
resistance to the spirit of the song and to the singer, was taken hold
of and shaken by the invisible influence,--was borne along by a wave
too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/>But, angrily resolved not to betray herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) work, and
went on making false stitches and pricking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fingers with much
perseverance, not looking up or taking notice of what was going
forward, until all the three voices united in <div class="bookquote">``Let us take the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I am afraid there would have been a subtle, stealing gratification in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had known how entirely this saucy, defiant Stephen was
occupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); how he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was passing rapidly from a determination to
treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with ostentatious indifference to an irritating desire for
some sign of inclination from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),--some interchange of subdued word
or look with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). It was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) found an opportunity, when
they had passed to the music of <div class="bookquote">``The Tempest.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Maggie, feeling the
need of a footstool, was walking across the room to get one, when
Stephen, who was not singing just then, and was conscious of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
movements, guessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) want, and flew to anticipate her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), lifting the
footstool with an entreating look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), which made it impossible not
to return a glance of gratitude. And then, to have the footstool
placed carefully by a too self-confident personage,--not _any_
self-confident personage, but one in particular, who suddenly looks
humble and anxious, and lingers, bending still, to ask if there is not
some draught in that position between the window and the fireplace,
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) may not be allowed to move the work-table for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),--these
things will summon a little of the too ready, traitorous tenderness
into a woman's eyes, compelled as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) girlish time to learn
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life-lessons in very trivial language. And to Maggie such things
had not been every-day incidents, but were a new element in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life,
and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) keen appetite for homage quite fresh. That tone of
gentle solicitude obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to look at the face that was bent toward
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and to say, <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>; and nothing could prevent that
mutual glance from being delicious to both, as it had been the evening
before.

<p/>It was but an ordinary act of politeness in Stephen; it had hardly
taken two minutes; and Lucy, who was singing, scarcely noticed it. But
to Philip's mind, filled already with a vague anxiety that was likely
to find a definite ground for itself in any trivial incident, this
sudden eagerness in Stephen, and the change in Maggie's face, which
was plainly reflecting a beam from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), seemed so strong a contrast
with the previous overwrought signs of indifference, as to be charged
with painful meaning. Stephen's voice, pouring in again, jarred upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) nervous susceptibility as if it had been the clang of sheet-iron,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) felt inclined to make the piano shriek in utter discord. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had
really seen no communicable ground for suspecting any ususual feeling
between Stephen and Maggie; his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own reason told him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) wanted
to go home at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) might reflect coolly on these false images,
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had convinced himself of their nullity. But then, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
wanted to stay as long as Stephen stayed,--always to be present when
Stephen was present with Maggie. It seemed to poor Philip so natural,
nay, inevitable, that any man who was near Maggie should fall in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)! There was no promise of happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were
beguiled into loving Stephen Guest; and this thought emboldened Philip
to view his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in the light of a less unequal offering.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was beginning to play very falsely under this deafening inward
tumult, and Lucy was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in astonishment, when Mrs.
Tulliver's entrance to summon them to lunch came as an excuse for
abruptly breaking off the music.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mr. Philip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, when they entered the dining-room,
<div class="bookquote">``I've not seen you for a long while. Your father's not at home, I
think, is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? I went after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to the office the other day, and they
said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was out of town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s been to Mudport on business for several days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip; <div class="bookquote">``but
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s come back now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) farming hobby as ever, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, rather wondering at this sudden interest
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father's pursuits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got some land in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own hands on this
side the river as well as the other, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Deane, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) dispensed the pigeonpie, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must
find farming a heavy item,--an expensive hobby. I never had a hobby
myself, never would give in to that. And the worst of all hobbies are
those that people think they can get money at. They shoot their money
down like corn out of a sack then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy felt a little nervous under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father's apparently gratuitous
criticism of Mr. Wakem's expenditure. But it ceased there, and Mr.
Deane became unusually silent and meditative during his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) luncheon.
Lucy, accustomed to watch all indications in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father, and having
reasons, which had recently become strong, for an extra interest in
what referred to the Wakems, felt an unusual curiosity to know what had
prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father's questions. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) subsequent silence made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
suspect there had been some special reason for them in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind.

<p/>With this idea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) resorted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) usual plan when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
wanted to tell or ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father anything particular: she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found a
reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) aunt Tulliver to leaving the dining-room after dinner,
and seated herself on a small stool at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father's knee. Mr. Deane,
under those circumstances, considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) tasted some of the most
agreeable moments his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) merits had purchased him (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) in life,
notwithstanding that Lucy, disliking to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hair powdered with
snuff, usually began by mastering his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) snuff-box on such occasions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want to go to sleep yet, papa, _do_ you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
brought up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stool and opened the large fingers that clutched the
snuff-box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, glancing at the reward of merit in the
decanter. <div class="bookquote">``But what do _you_ want?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) added, pinching the dimpled
chin fondly,--<div class="bookquote">``to coax some more sovereigns out of my pocket for your
bazaar? Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have no base motives at all to-day. I only want to talk, not to
beg. I want to know what made you ask Philip Wakem about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) father's
farming to-day, papa? It seemed rather odd, because you never hardly
say anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) father; and why should you care about
Mr. Wakem's losing money by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) hobby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something to do with business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) hands, as
if to repel intrusion into that mystery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, papa, you always say Mr. Wakem has brought Philip up like a
girl; how came you to think you should get any business knowledge out
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)? Those abrupt questions sounded rather oddly. Philip thought
them queer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, willing to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) social
demeanor, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had taken some pains in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) upward progress.
<div class="bookquote">``There's a report that Wakem's mill and farm on the other side of the
river--Dorlcote Mill, your uncle Tulliver's, you know--isn't answering
so well as it did. I wanted to see if your friend Philip would let
anything out about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father's being tired of farming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Would you buy the mill, papa, if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would part with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said
Lucy, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, tell me everything; here, you shall have your
snuff-box if you'll tell me. Because Maggie says all their hearts are
set on Tom's getting back the mill some time. It was one of the last
things her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father said to Tom, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must get back the mill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, you little puss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, availing himself of the
restored snuff-box. <div class="bookquote">``You must not say a word about this thing; do you
hear? There's very little chance of their getting the mill or of
anybody's getting it out of Wakem's hands. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) knew that we
wanted it with a view to the Tulliver's getting it again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)'d be the
less likely to part with it. It's natural, after what happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
behaved well enough to Tulliver before; but a horsewhipping is not
likely to be paid for with sugar-plums.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with a little air of solemnity, <div class="bookquote">``will you
trust me? You must not ask me all my reasons for what I'm going to
say, but I have very strong reasons. And I'm very cautious; I am,
indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let us hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I believe, if you will let me take Philip Wakem into our
confidence,--let me tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) all about your wish to buy, and what it's
for; that my cousins wish to have it, and why they wish to have it,--I
believe Philip would help to bring it about. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would desire to
do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how that can be, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Deane, looking puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``Why should _he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)_ care?'' (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>--then, with a sudden penetrating look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
daughter, <div class="bookquote">``You don't think the poor lad's fond of you, and so you can
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) do what you like?''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr. Deane felt quite safe about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
daughter's affections.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) cares very little about me,--not so much as I care about
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). But I have a reason for being quite sure of what I say. Don't you
ask me. And if you ever guess, don't tell me. Only give me leave to do
as I think fit about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stool to seat herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father's knee, and
kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with that last request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you won't do mischief, now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
with delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa, quite sure. I'm very wise; I've got all your business
talents. Didn't you admire my accompt-book, now, when I showed it
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, if this youngster will keep his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) counsel, there won't be
much harm done. And to tell the truth, I think there's not much chance

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter VIII

<p/>Wakem in a New Light


<p/>Before three days had passed after the conversation you have just
overheard between Lucy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had contrived to have a
private interview with Philip during a visit of Maggie's to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt
Glegg. For a day and a night Philip turned over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind with
restless agitation all that Lucy had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in that interview, till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had thoroughly resolved on a course of action. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) now a possibility of altering his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) position with respect to
Maggie, and removing at least one obstacle between them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
plan and calculated all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) moves with the fervid deliberation of a
chess-player in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) first ardor, and was amazed himself at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sudden genius as a tactician. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) plan was as bold as it was
thoroughly calculated. Having watched for a moment when his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father had
nothing more urgent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands than the newspaper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), laid a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shoulder, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, will you come up into my sanctum, and look at my new
sketches? I've arranged them now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm getting terrible stiff in the joints, Phil, for climbing those
stairs of yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, looking kindly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) laid
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) paper. <div class="bookquote">``But come along, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a nice place for you, isn't it, Phil?--a capital light that
from the roof, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was, as usual, the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) said on entering
the painting-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) liked to remind himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son too that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
fatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had been a good
father. Emily would have nothing to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) with there, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)
came back again from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) said, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) double eye-glass over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) nose, and
seating himself to take a general view while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) rested, <div class="bookquote">``you've got a
famous show here. Upon my word, I don't see that your things aren't as
good as that London artist's--what's his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) name--that Leyburn gave so
much money for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head and smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had seated himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
painting-stool, and had taken a lead pencil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was making strong marks to counteract the sense of tremulousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father get up, and walk slowly round, good-naturedly
dwelling on the pictures much longer than his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) amount of genuine taste
for landscape would have prompted, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stopped before a stand on
which two pictures were placed,--one much larger than the other, the
smaller one in a leather case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me! what have you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, startled by a sudden
transition from landscape to portrait. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd left off
figures. Who are these?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are the same person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, with calm promptness, <div class="bookquote">``at
different ages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what person?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, sharply fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) eyes with a growing
look of suspicion on the larger picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Tulliver. The small one is something like what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was when I
was at school with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) brother at King's Lorton; the larger one is not
quite so good a likeness of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was when I came from abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Wakem turned round fiercely, with a flushed face, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
eye-glass fall, and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son with a savage expression for a
moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was ready to strike that daring feebleness from the
stool. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) threw himself into the armchair again, and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) trouser-pockets, still looking angrily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son,
however. Philip did not return the look, but sat quietly watching the
point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pencil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you mean to say, then, that you have had any acquaintance with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) since you came from abroad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, at last, with that vain
effort which rage always makes to throw as much punishment as it
desires to inflict into words and tones, since blows are forbidden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I saw a great deal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) for a whole year before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) father's
death. We met often in that thicket--the Red Deeps--near Dorlcote
Mill. I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) dearly; I shall never love any other woman. I have
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was a little girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, sir! And you have corresponded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) all this while?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) till just before we parted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) brother not to see me again or to correspond with me. I
am not sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) loves me or would consent to marry me. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
would consent,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) _did_ love me well enough,--I should marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've
heaped on you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, getting white, and beginning to tremble
under an enraged sense of impotence before Philip's calm defiance and
concentration of purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for the first time; <div class="bookquote">``I
don't regard it as a return. You have been an indulgent father to me;
but I have always felt that it was because you had an affectionate
wish to give me as much happiness as my unfortunate lot would admit,
not that it was a debt you expected me to pay by sacrificing all my
chances of happiness to satisfy feelings of yours which I can never
share.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think most sons would share their father's feelings in this case,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``The girl's father was an ignorant mad brute,
who was within an inch of murdering me. The whole town knows it. And
the brother is just as insolent, only in a cooler way. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) forbade her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
seeing you, you say; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'ll break every bone in your body, for your
greater happiness, if you don't take care. But you seem to have made
up your mind; you have counted the consequences, I suppose. Of course
you are independent of me; you can marry this girl to-morrow, if you
like; you are a man of five-and-twenty,--you can go your way, and I
can go mine. We need have no more to do with each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Wakem rose and walked toward the door, but something held him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) back,
and instead of leaving the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) walked up and down it. Philip was
slow to reply, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tone had a more incisive
quietness and clearness than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I can't marry Miss Tulliver, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would have me, if I have
only my own resources to maintain her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) with. I have been brought up to
no profession. I can't offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) poverty as well as deformity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, _there_ is a reason for your clinging to me, doubtless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Wakem, still bitterly, though Philip's last words had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a
pang; they had stirred a feeling which had been a habit for a quarter
of a century. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) threw himself into the chair again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expected all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I know these scenes are often
happening between father and son. If I were like other men of my age,
I might answer your angry words by still angrier; we might part; I
should marry the woman I love, and have a chance of being as happy as
the rest. But if it will be a satisfaction to you to annihilate the
very object of everything you've done for me, you have an advantage
over most fathers; you can completely deprive me of the only thing
that would make my life worth having.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip paused, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best what satisfaction you would have, beyond that of
gratifying a ridiculous rancor worthy only of wandering savages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ridiculous rancor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>Wakem burst out. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? Damn it! is a
man to be horsewhipped by a boor and love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it? Besides, there's
that cold, proud devil of a son, who said a word to me I shall not
forget when we had the settling. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would be as pleasant a mark for a
bullet as I know, if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) were worth the expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean your resentment toward them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
reasons for some sympathy with this view of Tom, <div class="bookquote">``though a feeling of
revenge is not worth much, that you should care to keep it. I mean
your extending the enmity to a helpless girl, who has too much sense
and goodness to share their narrow prejudices. _She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ has never entered
into the family quarrels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that signify? We don't ask what a woman does; we ask whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belongs to. It's altogether a degrading thing to you, to think of
marrying old Tulliver's daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>For the first time in the dialogue, Philip lost some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
self-control, and colored with anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, with bitter incisiveness, <div class="bookquote">``has the only
grounds of rank that anything but vulgar folly can suppose to belong
to the middle class; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) is thoroughly refined, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) friends,
whatever else they may be, are respected for irreproachable honor and
integrity. All St. Ogg's, I fancy, would pronounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to be more than
my equal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Wakem darted a glance of fierce question at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son; but Philip was
not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and with a certain penitent consciousness went on,
in a few moments, as if in amplification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) last words,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Find a single person in St. Ogg's who will not tell you that a
beautiful creature like her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) would be throwing herself away on a
pitiable object like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, rising again, and forgetting everything else in
a burst of resentful pride, half fatherly, half personal. <div class="bookquote">``It would be
a deuced fine match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). It's all stuff about an accidental
deformity, when a girl's really attached to a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But girls are not apt to get attached under those circumstances,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem, rather brutally, trying to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
previous position, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doesn't care for you, you might have spared
yourself the trouble of talking to me about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and you might have
spared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely
to happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Wakem strode to the door, and without looking round again, banged it
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>).

<p/>Philip was not without confidence that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father would be ultimately
wrought upon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had expected, by what had passed; but the scene had
jarred upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) nerves, which were as sensitive as a woman's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
determined not to go down to dinner; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) couldn't meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father again
that day. It was Wakem's habit, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had no company at home, to go
out in the evening, often as early as half-past seven; and as it was
far on in the afternoon now, Philip locked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) room and went out
for a long ramble, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would not return until his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father was
out of the house again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) got into a boat, and went down the river to
a favorite village, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dined, and lingered till it was late
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to return. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had never had any sort of quarrel with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father before, and had a sickening fear that this contest, just
begun, might go on for weeks; and what might not happen in that time?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would not allow himself to define what that involuntary question
meant. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could once be in the position of Maggie's accepted,
acknowledged lover, there would be less room for vague dread. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went
up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) painting-room again, and threw himself with a sense of
fatigue into the armchair, looking round absently at the views of
water and rock that were ranged around, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fell into a doze, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fancied Maggie was slipping down a glistening, green, slimy
channel of a waterfall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was looking on helpless, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was
awakened by what seemed a sudden, awful crash.

<p/>It was the opening of the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could hardly have dozed more
than a few moments, for there was no perceptible change in the evening
light. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father who entered; and when Philip moved to vacate
the chair for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit still. I'd rather walk about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stalked up and down the room once or twice, and then, standing
opposite Philip with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands thrust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) side pockets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, as
if continuing a conversation that had not been broken off,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this girl seems to have been fond of you, Phil, else she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wouldn't
have met you in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip's heart was beating rapidly, and a transient flush passed over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face like a gleam. It was not quite easy to speak at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked me at King's Lorton, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a little girl, because I
used to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother a great deal when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) foot.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had kept that in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) memory, and thought of me as a friend of a
long while ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't think of me as a lover when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) met me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but you made love to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at last. What did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) say then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Wakem, walking about again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) _did_ love me then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound it, then; what else do you want? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a jilt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very young then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, hesitatingly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hardly knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt. I'm afraid our long separation, and the
idea that events must always divide us, may have made a difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s in the town. I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at church. Haven't you spoken to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) since you came back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, at Mr. Deane's. But I couldn't renew my proposals to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on
several grounds. One obstacle would be removed if you would give your
consent,--if you would be willing to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a daughter-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>Wakem was silent a little while, pausing before Maggie's picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s not the sort of woman your mother was, though, Phil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) said,
at last. <div class="bookquote">``I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at church,--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s handsomer than this,--deuced
fine eyes and fine figure, I saw; but rather dangerous and
unmanageable, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s very tender and affectionate, and so simple,--without the airs
and petty contrivances other women have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Wakem. Then looking round at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``But your mother
looked gentler; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had that brown wavy hair and gray eyes, like
yours. You can't remember her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very well. It was a thousand pities I'd
no likeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>son mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, shouldn't you be glad for me to have the same sort of
happiness, father, to sweeten my life for me? There can never be
another tie so strong to you as that which began eight-and-twenty
years ago, when you married my mother, and you have been tightening it
ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Phil, you're the only fellow that knows the best of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said
Wakem, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``We must keep together if we can.
And now, what am I to do? You must come downstairs and tell me. Am I
to go and call on this dark-eyed damsel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>The barrier once thrown down in this way, Philip could talk freely to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father of their entire relation with the Tullivers,--of the desire
to get the mill and land back into the family, and of its transfer to
Guest & Co. as an intermediate step. He (<font color='blue'><b>Co.</b></font>) could venture now to be
persuasive and urgent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Co.</b></font>) father yielded with more readiness than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Co.</b></font>) had calculated on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ don't care about the mill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Co.</b></font>) said at last, with a sort of angry
compliance. <div class="bookquote">``I've had an infernal deal of bother lately about the
mill. Let them pay me for my improvements, that's all. But there's one
thing you needn't ask me. I shall have no direct transactions with
young Tulliver. If you like to swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister's sake, you
may; but I've no sauce that will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) go down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I leave you to imagine the agreeable feelings with which Philip went
to Mr. Deane the next day, to say that Mr. Wakem was ready to open the
negotiations, and Lucy's pretty triumph as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) great business abilities. Mr. Deane was
rather puzzled, and suspected that there had been something <div class="bookquote">``going on''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div>among the young people to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) wanted a clew. But to men of Mr.
Deane's stamp, what goes on among the young people is as extraneous to
the real business of life as what goes on among the birds and
butterflies, until it can be shown to have a malign bearing on
monetary affairs. And in this case the bearing appeared to be entirely
propitious.



<p/>Chapter IX

<p/>Charity in Full-Dress


<p/>The culmination of Maggie's career as an admired member of society in
St. Ogg's was certainly the day of the bazaar, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) simple noble
beauty, clad in a white muslin of some soft-floating kind, which I
suspect must have come from the stores of aunt Pullet's wardrobe,
appeared with marked distinction among the more adorned and
conventional women around her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). We perhaps never detect how much of our
social demeanor is made up of artificial airs until we see a person
who is at once beautiful and simple; without the beauty, we are apt to
call simplicity awkwardness. The Miss Guests were much too well-bred
to have any of the grimaces and affected tones that belong to
pretentious vulgarity; but their stall being next to the one where
Maggie sat, it seemed newly obvious to-day that Miss Guest held her (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)
chin too high, and that Miss Laura spoke and moved continually with a
view to effect.

<p/>All well-dressed St. Ogg's and its neighborhood were there; and it
would have been worth while to come even from a distance, to see the
fine old hall, with its open roof and carved oaken rafters, and great
oaken folding-doors, and light shed down from a height on the
many-colored show beneath; a very quaint place, with broad faded
stripes painted on the walls, and here and there a show of heraldic
animals of a bristly, long-snouted character, the cherished emblems of
a noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall. A grand
arch, cut in the upper wall at one end, surmounted an oaken orchestra,
with an open room behind it, where hothouse plants and stalls for
refreshments were disposed; an agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed
to loiter, and yet to exchange the occasional crush down below for a
more commodious point of view. In fact, the perfect fitness of this
ancient building for an admirable modern purpose, that made charity
truly elegant, and led through vanity up to the supply of a deficit,
was so striking that hardly a person entered the room without
exchanging the remark more than once. Near the great arch over the
orchestra was the stone oriel with painted glass, which was one of the
venerable inconsistencies of the old hall; and it was close by this
that Lucy had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stall, for the convenience of certain large plain
articles which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had taken charge of for Mrs. Kenn. Maggie had
begged to sit at the open end of the stall, and to have the sale of
these articles rather than of bead-mats and other elaborate products
of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had but a dim understanding. But it soon appeared that
the gentlemen's dressing-gowns, which were among her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) commodities, were
objects of such general attention and inquiry, and excited so
troublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits,
together with a determination to test them by trying on, as to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) post a very conspicuous one. The ladies who had commodities of
their own to sell, and did not want dressing-gowns, saw at once the
frivolity and bad taste of this masculine preference for goods which
any tailor could furnish; and it is possible that the emphatic notice
of various kinds which was drawn toward Miss Tulliver on this public
occasion, threw a very strong and unmistakable light on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) subsequent
conduct in many minds then present. Not that anger, on account of
spurned beauty can dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable
ladies, but rather that the errors of persons who have once been much
admired necessarily take a deeper tinge from the mere force of
contrast; and also, that to-day Maggie's conspicuous position, for the
first time, made evident certain characteristics which were
subsequently felt to have an explanatory bearing. There was something
rather bold in Miss Tulliver's direct gaze, and something undefinably
coarse in the style of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) beauty, which placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), in the opinion of
all feminine judges, far below her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) cousin Miss Deane; for the ladies
of St. Ogg's had now completely ceded to Lucy their hypothetic claims
on the admiration of Mr. Stephen Guest.

<p/>As for dear little Lucy herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) late benevolent triumph about the
Mill, and all the affectionate projects she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was cherishing for Maggie
and Philip, helped to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the highest spirits to-day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
felt nothing but pleasure in the evidence of Maggie's attractiveness.
It is true, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was looking very charming herself, and Stephen was
paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the utmost attention on this public occasion; jealously
buying up the articles he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had seen under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fingers in the process of
making, and gayly helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to cajole the male customers into the
purchase of the most effeminate futilities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chose to lay aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
hat and wear a scarlet fez of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) embroidering; but by superficial
observers this was necessarily liable to be interpreted less as a
compliment to Lucy than as a mark of coxcombry. <div class="bookquote">``Guest is a great
coxcomb,''  (<font color='red'><b>Torry/Miss Torry</b></font>)</div>young Torry observed; <div class="bookquote">``but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) is a privileged person in
St. Ogg's--he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) carries all before him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>); if another fellow did such
things, everybody would say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) made a fool of himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Torry/Miss Torry</b></font>)</div><p/>And Stephen purchased absolutely nothing from Maggie, until Lucy said,
in rather a vexed undertone,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, now; all the things of Maggie's knitting will be gone, and you
will not have bought one. There are those deliciously soft warm things
for the wrists,--do buy them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">``they must be intended for imaginative persons,
who can chill themselves on this warm day by thinking of the frosty
Caucasus. Stern reason is my forte, you know. You must get Philip to
buy those. By the way, why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) never likes going where there are many people, though I enjoined
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would buy up any of my goods that the rest of
the world rejected. But now, do go and buy something of Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has got a customer; there is old Wakem himself just
coming up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy's eyes turned with anxious interest toward Maggie to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
went through this first interview, since a sadly memorable time, with
a man toward whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must have so strange a mixture of feelings; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was pleased to notice that Wakem had tact enough to enter at once
into talk about the bazaar wares, and appear interested in purchasing,
smiling now and then kindly at Maggie, and not calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to speak
much, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was rather pale and tremulous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, in an undertone to Lucy; <div class="bookquote">``is it pure magnanimity? You
talked of a family quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that will soon be quite healed, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, becoming a
little indiscreet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) satisfaction, and speaking with an air of
significance. But Stephen did not appear to notice this, and as some
lady-purchasers came up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) lounged on toward Maggie's end, handling
trifles and standing aloof until Wakem, who had taken out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) purse,
had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) transactions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son came with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) overheard Wakem saying, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has vanished
into some other part of the building, and has left all these
charitable gallantries to me. I hope you'll reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
shabby conduct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) smile and bow without speaking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) turned away,
only then observing Stephen and nodding to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). Maggie, conscious that
Stephen was still there, busied herself with counting money, and
avoided looking up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been well pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had devoted
himself to Lucy to-day, and had not come near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). They had begun the
morning with an indifferent salutation, and both had rejoiced in being
aloof from each other, like a patient who has actually done without
his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) opium, in spite of former failures in resolution. And during the
last few days they had even been making up their minds to failures,
looking to the outward events that must soon come to separate them, as
a reason for dispensing with self-conquest in detail.

<p/>Stephen moved step by step as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) were being unwillingly dragged,
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden
by a screen of draperies. Maggie went on counting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) money till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying, <div class="bookquote">``Aren't you very tried? Do
let me bring you something,--some fruit or jelly, mayn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The unexpected tones shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) like a sudden accidental vibration of a
harp close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said faintly, and only half looking up for an
instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look so pale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>Stephen insisted, in a more entreating tone. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
sure you're exhausted. I must disobey you, and bring something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I couldn't take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you angry with me? What have I done? _Do_ look at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) helplessly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes
glancing immediately from him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) to the opposite corner of the orchestra,
which was half hidden by the folds of the old faded green curtain.
Maggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was wretched at
the admission it implied; but Stephen turned away at once, and
following her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) upward glance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) saw Philip Wakem sealed in the
half-hidden corner, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) could command little more than that
angle of the hall in which Maggie sat. An entirely new though occurred
to Stephen, and linking itself with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had observed of Wakem's
manner, and with Lucy's reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) observation, it convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
that there had been some former relation between Philip and Maggie
beyond that childish one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had heard. More than one impulse
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) immediately leave the hall and go upstairs to the
refreshment-room, where, walking up to Philip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sat down behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you studying for a portrait, Phil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or for a sketch of
that oriel window? By George, it makes a capital bit from this dark
corner, with the curtain just marking it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been studying expression,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Miss Tulliver's? It's rather of the savage-moody order to-day,
I think,--something of the fallen princess serving behind a counter.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) cousin sent me to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) with a civil offer to get her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) some
refreshment, but I have been snubbed, as usual. There's natural
antipathy between us, I suppose; I have seldom the honor to please
her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a hypocrite you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, flushing angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! because experience must have told me that I'm universally
pleasing? I admit the law, but there's some disturbing force here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, rising abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I--to get a breath of fresh air; this place gets oppressive. I
think I have done suit and service long enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friends</b></font>)</div><p/>The two friends walked downstairs together without speaking. Philip
turned through the outer door into the court-yard; but Stephen,
saying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, by the by, I must call in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>went on along the
passage to one of the rooms at the other end of the building, which
were appropriated to the town library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had the room all to himself,
and a man requires nothing less than this when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to dash his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cap on the table, throw himself astride a chair, and stare at a high
brick wall with a frown which would not have been beneath the occasion
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been slaying <div class="bookquote">``the giant Python.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The conduct that issues
from a moral conflict has often so close a resemblance to vice that
the distinction escapes all outward judgments founded on a mere
comparison of actions. It is clear to you, I hope, that Stephen was
not a hypocrite,--capable of deliberate doubleness for a selfish end;
and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) fluctuations between the indulgence of a feeling and the
systematic concealment of it might have made a good case in support of
Philip's accusation.

<p/>Meanwhile, Maggie sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stall cold and trembling, with that
painful sensation in the eyes which comes from resolutely repressed
tears. Was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life to be always like this,--always bringing some new
source of inward strife? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard confusedly the busy, indifferent
voices around her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind could flow into that easy
babbling current. It was at this moment that Dr. Kenn, who had quite
lately come into the hall, and was now walking down the middle with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>), taking a general view, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) eyes on Maggie
for the first time, and was struck with the expression of pain on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
beautiful face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was sitting quite still, for the stream of
customers had lessened at this late hour in the afternoon; the
gentlemen had chiefly chosen the middle of the day, and Maggie's stall
was looking rather bare. This, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) absent, pained expression,
finished the contrast between her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companions, who were all
bright, eager, and busy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) was strongly arrested. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face had
naturally drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) attention as a new and striking one at church, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) had been introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) during a short call on business at Mr.
Deane's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had never spoken more than three words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>)
walked toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now, and Maggie, perceiving some one approaching,
roused herself to look up and be prepared to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt a
childlike, instinctive relief from the sense of uneasiness in this
exertion, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw it was Dr. Kenn's face that was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>);
that plain, middle-aged face, with a grave, penetrating kindness in
it, seeming to tell of a human being who had reached a firm, safe
strand, but was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers still
tossed by the waves, had an effect on Maggie at this moment which was
afterward remembered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as if it had been a promise. The
middle-aged, who have lived through their strongest emotions, but are
yet in the time when memory is still half passionate and not merely
contemplative, should surely be a sort of natural priesthood, whom
life has disciplined and consecrated to be the refuge and rescue of
early stumblers and victims of self-despair. Most of us, at some
moment in our young lives, would have welcomed a priest of that
natural order in any sort of canonicals or uncanonicals, but had to
scramble upward into all the difficulties of nineteen entirely without
such aid, as Maggie did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You find your office rather a fatiguing one, I fear, Miss Tulliver,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Kenn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, simply, not being accustomed to simpler
amiable denials of obvious facts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can tell Mrs. Kenn that you have disposed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) goods very
quickly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) will be very much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have done nothing; the gentlemen came very fast to buy the
dressing-gowns and embroidered waistcoats, but I think any of the
other ladies would have sold more; I didn't know what to say about
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Kenn smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I hope I'm going to have you as a permanent
parishioner now, Miss Tulliver; am I? You have been at a distance from
us hitherto.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a teacher in a school, and I'm going into another
situation of the same kind very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah? I was hoping you would remain among your friends, who are all in
this neighborhood, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, _I must go_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, earnestly, looking at Dr. Kenn with an
expression of reliance, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) history in those
three words. It was one of those moments of implicit revelation which
will sometimes happen even between people who meet quite
transiently,--on a mile's journey, perhaps, or when resting by the
wayside. There is always this possibility of a word or look from a
stranger to keep alive the sense of human brotherhood.

<p/>Dr. Kenn's ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief
confidence of Maggie's was charged with meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you feel it right to go. But that will not
prevent our meeting again, I hope; it will not prevent my knowing you
better, if I can be of any service to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) hand and pressed hers kindly before he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has some trouble or other at heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) thought. ``Poor child! she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might turn out to be one of

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The souls by nature pitched too high,
By suffering plunged too low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something wonderfully honest in those beautiful eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>It may be surprising that Maggie, among whose many imperfections an
excessive delight in admiration and acknowledged supremacy were not
absent now, any more than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was instructing the gypsies with a
view toward achieving a royal position among them, was not more elated
on a day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had had the tribute of so many looks and smiles,
together with that satisfactory consciousness which had necessarily
come from being taken before Lucy's chevalglass, and made to look at
the full length of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tall beauty, crowned by the night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) massy
hair. Maggie had smiled at herself then, and for the moment had
forgotten everything in the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own beauty. If that state of
mind could have lasted, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) choice would have been to have Stephen
Guest at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feet, offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a life filled with all luxuries, with
daily incense of adoration near and distant, and with all
possibilities of culture at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) command. But there were things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
stronger than vanity,--passion and affection, and long, deep memories
of early discipline and effort, of early claims on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) love and pity;
and the stream of vanity was soon swept along and mingled
imperceptibly with that wider current which was at its highest force
today, under the double urgency of the events and inward impulses
brought by the last week.

<p/>Philip had not spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) himself about the removal of obstacles
between them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father's side,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shrank from that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
told everything to Lucy, with the hope that Maggie, being informed
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) some encouraging sign that their being
brought thus much nearer to each other was a happiness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). The
rush of conflicting feelings was too great for Maggie to say much when
Lucy, with a face breathing playful joy, like one of Correggio's
cherubs, poured forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) triumphant revelation; and Lucy could hardly
be surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could do little more than cry with gladness at
the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father's wish being fulfilled, and of Tom's getting
the Mill again in reward for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hard striving. The details of
preparation for the bazaar had then come to usurp Lucy's attention for
the next few days, and nothing had been said by the cousins on
subjects that were likely to rouse deeper feelings. Philip had been to
the house more than once, but Maggie had had no private conversation
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been left to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inward battle
without interference.

<p/>But when the bazaar was fairly ended, and the cousins were alone
again, resting together at home, Lucy said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must give up going to stay with your aunt Moss the day after
to-morrow, Maggie; write a note to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) you have put it
off at my request, and I'll send the man with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) won't be
displeased; you'll have plenty of time to go by-and-by; and I don't
want you to go out of the way just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed I must go, dear; I can't put it off. I wouldn't leave
aunt Gritty out for the world. And I shall have very little time, for
I'm going away to a new situation on the 25th of June.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, almost white with astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't tell you, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, making a great effort to
command herself, <div class="bookquote">``because you've been so busy. But some time ago I
wrote to our old governess, Miss Firniss, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to let me know if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) met with any situation that I could fill, and the other day I had
a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) telling me that I could take three orphan pupils of
hers to the coast during the holidays, and then make trial of a
situation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as teacher. I wrote yesterday to accept the offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy felt so hurt that for some moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was unable to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``how could you be so unkind to me--not to
tell me--to take _such_ a step--and now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hesitated a little, and
then added, <div class="bookquote">``And Philip? I thought everything was going to be so
happy. Oh, Maggie, what is the reason? Give it up; let me write. There
is nothing now to keep you and Philip apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, faintly. <div class="bookquote">``There is Tom's feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said I must
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up if I married Philip. And I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will not change--at
least not for a long while--unless something happened to soften him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'s coming back this week. And this good
news about the Mill will soften him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). And I'll talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) about
Philip. Tom's always very compliant to me; I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'s so
obstinate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a distressed voice. <div class="bookquote">``I must leave
some time to pack. Don't press me to stay, dear Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy was silent for two or three minutes, looking away and ruminating.
At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knelt down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cousin, and looking up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face
with anxious seriousness, said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, is it that you don't love Philip well enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)?
Tell me--trust me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie held Lucy's hands tightly in silence a little while. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
hands were quite cold. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) voice was quite clear
and distinct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Lucy, I would choose to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). I think it would be the best
and highest lot for me,--to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) life happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) loved me first. No
one else could be quite what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is to me. But I can't divide myself
from my brother for life. I must go away, and wait. Pray don't speak
to me again about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy obeyed in pain and wonder. The next word she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said was,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear Maggie, at least you will go to the dance at Park House
to-morrow, and have some music and brightness, before you go to pay
these dull dutiful visits. Ah! here come aunty and the tea.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter X

<p/>The Spell Seems Broken


<p/>The suite of rooms opening into each other at Park House looked duly
brilliant with lights and flowers and the personal splendors of
sixteen couples, with attendant parents and guardians. The focus of
brilliancy was the long drawing-room, where the dancing went forward,
under the inspiration of the grand piano; the library, into which it
opened at one end, had the more sober illumination of maturity, with
caps and cards; and at the other end the pretty sitting-room, with a
conservatory attached, was left as an occasional cool retreat. Lucy,
who had laid aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) black for the first time, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pretty
slimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape, was the
acknowledged queen of the occasion; for this was one of the Miss
Guests' thoroughly condescending parties, including no member of any
aristocracy higher than that of St. Ogg's, and stretching to the
extreme limits of commercial and professional gentility.

<p/>Maggie at first refused to dance, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had forgotten all
the figures--it was so many years since she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had danced at school; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was glad to have that excuse, for it is ill dancing with a heavy
heart. But at length the music wrought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) young limbs, and the
longing came; even though it was the horrible young Torry, who walked
up a second time to try and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>)
could not dance anything but a country-dance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>), of course, was
willing to wait for that high felicity, meaning only to be
complimentary when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) at several intervals that it was a
<div class="bookquote">``great bore''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) couldn't waltz, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) would have liked so much to
waltz with her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>). But at last it was the turn of the good old-fashioned
dance which has the least of vanity and the most of merriment in it,
and Maggie quite forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of
that half-rustic rhythm which seems to banish pretentious etiquette.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt quite charitably toward young Torry, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) hand bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>)
along and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) up in the dance; her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) eyes and cheeks had that fire
of young joy in them which will flame out if it can find the least
breath to fan it; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) simple black dress, with its bit of black
lace, seemed like the dim setting of a jewel.

<p/>Stephen had not yet asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) to dance; had not yet paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) more than
a passing civility. Since yesterday, that inward vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) which
perpetually made part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) consciousness, had been half screened by
the image of Philip Wakem, which came across it like a blot; there was
some attachment between her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) and Philip; at least there was an
attachment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) side, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) feel in some bondage. Here,
then, Stephen told himself, was another claim of honor which called on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) to resist the attraction that was continually threatening to
overpower him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) told himself so; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had once or twice felt a
certain savage resistance, and at another moment a shuddering
repugnance, to this intrusion of Philip's image, which almost made it
a new incitement to rush toward Maggie and claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for himself.
Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had done what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) meant to do this evening,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
kept aloof from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had hardly looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been
gayly assiduous to Lucy. But now his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes were devouring Maggie; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
felt inclined to kick young Torry out of the dance, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
place. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wanted the dance to end that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might get rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
partner. The possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) too should dance with Maggie, and
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so long, was beginning to possess him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) like a
thirst. But even now their hands were meeting in the dance,--were
meeting still to the very end of it, though they were far off each
other.

<p/>Stephen hardly knew what happened, or in what automatic way he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) got
through the duties of politeness in the interval, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was free
and saw Maggie seated alone again, at the farther end of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) way toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) round the couples that were forming for the
waltz; and when Maggie became conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was the person he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
sought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt, in spite of all the thoughts that had gone before, a
glowing gladness at heart. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes and cheeks were still brightened
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) childlike enthusiasm in the dance; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whole frame was set to
joy and tenderness; even the coming pain could not seem bitter,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was ready to welcome it as a part of life, for life at this moment
seemed a keen, vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain.
This one, this last night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might expand unrestrainedly in the
warmth of the present, without those chill, eating thoughts of the
past and the future.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're going to waltz again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, bending to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
with that glance and tone of subdued tenderness which young dreams
create to themselves in the summer woods when low, cooing voices fill
the air. Such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them
into a room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard
flirtation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are going to waltz again. It is rather dizzy work to look on,
and the room is very warm; shall we walk about a little?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand and placed it within his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm, and they walked on into
the sitting-room, where the tables were strewn with engravings for the
accommodation of visitors who would not want to look at them. But no
visitors were here at this moment. They passed on into the
conservatory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights
among them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``They look as if they
belonged to an enchanted land, and would never fade away; I could
fancy they were all made of jewels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was looking at the tier of geraniums as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke, and Stephen
made no answer; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and does not a supreme poet
blend light and sound into one, calling darkness mute, and light
eloquent? Something strangely powerful there was in the light of
Stephen's long gaze, for it made Maggie's face turn toward it and look
upward at it, slowly, like a flower at the ascending brightness. And
they walked unsteadily on, without feeling that they were walking;
without feeling anything but that long, grave, mutual gaze which has
the solemnity belonging to all deep human passion. The hovering
thought that they must and would renounce each other made this moment
of mute confession more intense in its rapture.

<p/>But they had reached the end of the conservatory, and were obliged to
pause and turn. The change of movement brought a new consciousness to
Maggie; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) blushed deeply, turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm
from Stephen's, going up to some flowers to smell them. Stephen stood
motionless, and still pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, may I get this rose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, making a great effort to say
something, and dissipate the burning sense of irretrievable
confession. <div class="bookquote">``I think I am quite wicked with roses; I like to gather
them and smell them till they have no scent left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen was mute; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was incapable of putting a sentence together, and
Maggie bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm a little upward toward the large half-opened rose
that had attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Who has not felt the beauty of a woman's arm?
The unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled
elbow, and all the varied gently lessening curves, down to the
delicate wrist, with its tiniest, almost imperceptible nicks in the
firm softness. A woman's arm touched the soul of a great sculptor two
thousand years ago, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) wrought an image of it for the
Parthenon which moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn
marble of a headless trunk. Maggie's was such an arm as that, and it
had the warm tints of life.

<p/>A mad impulse seized on Stephen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) darted toward the arm, and
showered kisses on it, clasping the wrist.

<p/>But the next moment Maggie snatched it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
like a wounded war-goddess, quivering with rage and humiliation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke in a deeply shaken, half-smothered voice.
<div class="bookquote">``What right have I given you to insult me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) darted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) into the adjoining room, and threw herself on the
sofa, panting and trembling.

<p/>A horrible punishment was come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for the sin of allowing a
moment's happiness that was treachery to Lucy, to Philip, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own
better soul. That momentary happiness had been smitten with a blight,
a leprosy; Stephen thought more lightly of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_ than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) did of Lucy.

<p/>As for Stephen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) leaned back against the framework of the
conservatory, dizzy with the conflict of passions,--love, rage, and
confused despair; despair at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) want of self-mastery, and despair
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had offended Maggie.

<p/>The last feeling surmounted every other; to be by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side again and
entreat forgiveness was the only thing that had the force of a motive
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not been seated more than a few minutes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
came and stood humbly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But Maggie's bitter rage was
unspent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me to myself, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, with impetuous
haughtiness, <div class="bookquote">``and for the future avoid me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen turned away, and walked backward and forward at the other end
of the room. There was the dire necessity of going back into the
dancing-room again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was beginning to be conscious of that. They
had been absent so short a time, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went in again the waltz
was not ended.

<p/>Maggie, too, was not long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) re-entered. All the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
nature was stung into activity; the hateful weakness which had dragged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) within reach of this wound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) self-respect had at least
wrought its own cure. The thoughts and temptations of the last month
should all be flung away into an unvisited chamber of memory. There
was nothing to allure her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now; duty would be easy, and all the old
calm purposes would reign peacefully once more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) re-entered the
drawing-room still with some excited brightness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face, but with
a sense of proud self-command that defied anything to agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
refused to dance again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) talked quite readily and calmly with
every one who addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). And when they got home that night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
kissed Lucy with a free heart, almost exulting in this scorching
moment, which had delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from the possibility of another word
or look that would have the stamp of treachery toward that gentle,
unsuspicious sister.

<p/>The next morning Maggie did not set off to Basset quite so soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had expected. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother was to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in the carriage, and
household business could not be dispatched hastily by Mrs. Tulliver.
So Maggie, who had been in a hurry to prepare herself, had to sit
waiting, equipped for the drive, in the garden. Lucy was busy in the
house wrapping up some bazaar presents for the younger ones at Basset,
and when there was a loud ring at the door-bell, Maggie felt some
alarm lest Lucy should bring out Stephen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); it was sure to be
Stephen.

<p/>But presently the visitor came out into the garden alone, and seated
himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on the garden-chair. It was not Stephen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can just catch the tips of the Scotch firs, Maggie, from this
seat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip.

<p/>They had taken each other's hands in silence, but Maggie had looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with a more complete revival of the old childlike affectionate
smile than he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had seen before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt encouraged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I often look at them, and wish I could see the low
sunlight on the stems again. But I have never been that way but
once,--to the churchyard with my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been there, I go there, continually,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I have
nothing but the past to live upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>A keen remembrance and keen pity impelled Maggie to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand in
Philip's. They had so often walked hand in hand!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember all the spots,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``just where you told me of
particular things, beautiful stories that I had never heard of
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will go there again soon, won't you, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip,
getting timid. <div class="bookquote">``The Mill will soon be your brother's home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I shall not be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``I shall only hear of
that happiness. I am going away again; Lucy has not told you,
perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the future will never join on to the past again, Maggie? That
book is quite closed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>The gray eyes that had so often looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with entreating
worship, looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now, with a last struggling ray of hope in
them, and Maggie met them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) large sincere gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That book never will be closed, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, with grave
sadness; <div class="bookquote">``I desire no future that will break the ties of the past. But
the tie to my brother is one of the strongest. I can do nothing
willingly that will divide me always from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the only reason that would keep us apart forever, Maggie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, with a desperate determination to have a definite answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with calm decision. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) believed
it. At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt as if the enchanted cup had been dashed to
the ground. The reactionary excitement that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a proud
self-mastery had not subsided, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked at the future with a
sense of calm choice.

<p/>They sat hand in hand without looking at each other or speaking for a
few minutes; in Maggie's mind the first scenes of love and parting
were more present than the actual moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was looking at
Philip in the Red Deeps.

<p/>Philip felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ought to have been thoroughly happy in that answer
of hers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was as open and transparent as a rock-pool. Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
not thoroughly happy? Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short
of an omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.



<p/>Chapter XI

<p/>In the Lane


<p/>Maggie had been four days at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt Moss's giving the early June
sunshine quite a new brightness in the care-dimmed eyes of that
affectionate woman, and making an epoch for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousins great and
small, who were learning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words and actions by heart, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
been a transient avatar of perfect wisdom and beauty.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was standing on the causeway with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt and a group of cousins
feeding the chickens, at that quiet moment in the life of the
farmyards before the afternoon milking-time. The great buildings round
the hollow yard were as dreary and tumbledown as ever, but over the
old garden-wall the straggling rose-bushes were beginning to toss
their summer weight, and the gray wood and old bricks of the house, on
its higher level, had a look of sleepy age in the broad afternoon
sunlight, that suited the quiescent time. Maggie, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm, was smiling down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens, when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt exclaimed,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness me! who is that gentleman coming in at the gate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a gentleman on a tall bay horse; and the flanks and neck of the
horse were streaked black with fast riding. Maggie felt a beating at
head and heart, horrible as the sudden leaping to life of a savage
enemy who had feigned death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss, seeing in Maggie's face the
evidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Mr. Stephen Guest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, rather faintly. <div class="bookquote">``My cousin
Lucy's--a gentleman who is very intimate at my cousin's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen was already close to them, had jumped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) horse, and now
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) advanced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold the horse, Willy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moss/Moss</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Moss to the twelve-year-old boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, pulling at the horse's impatiently
tossing head. <div class="bookquote">``I must be going again immediately. I have a message to
deliver to you, Miss Tulliver, on private business. May I take the
liberty of asking you to walk a few yards with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had a half-jaded, half-irritated look, such as a man gets when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has been dogged by some care or annoyance that makes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
dinner of little use to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke almost abruptly, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
errand were too pressing for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to trouble himself about what would
be thought by Mrs. Moss of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit and request. Good Mrs. Moss,
rather nervous in the presence of this apparently haughty gentleman,
was inwardly wondering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) would be doing right or wrong to
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse and walk in, when Maggie, feeling
all the embarrassment of the situation, and unable to say anything,
put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet, and turned to walk toward the gate.

<p/>Stephen turned too, and walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side, leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) horse.

<p/>Not a word was spoken till they were out in the lane, and had walked
four or five yards, when Maggie, who had been looking straight before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) all the while, turned again to walk back, saying, with haughty
resentment,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no need for me to go any farther. I don't know whether you
consider it gentlemanly and delicate conduct to place me in a position
that forced me to come out with you, or whether you wished to insult
me still further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you are angry with me for coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, bitterly.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course it is of no consequence what a man has to suffer; it is
only your woman's dignity that you care about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie gave a slight start, such as might have come from the slightest
possible electric shock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if it were not enough that I'm entangled in this way; that I'm mad
with love for you; that I resist the strongest passion a man can feel,
because I try to be true to other claims; but you must treat me as if
I were a coarse brute, who would willingly offend you. And when, if I
had my own choice, I should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and
my whole life, and do what you liked with them! I know I forgot
myself. I took an unwarrantable liberty. I hate myself for having done
it. But I repented immediately; I've been repenting ever since. You
ought not to think it unpardonable; a man who loves with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole
soul, as I do you, is liable to be mastered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings for a
moment; but you know--you must believe--that the worst pain I could
have is to have pained you; that I would give the world to recall the
error.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie dared not speak, dared not turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head. The strength that had
come from resentment was all gone, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips were quivering
visibly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could not trust herself to utter the full forgiveness
that rose in answer to that confession.

<p/>They were come nearly in front of the gate again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) paused,
trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not say these things; I must not hear them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said,
looking down in misery, as Stephen came in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), to prevent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from going farther toward the gate. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry for any pain
you have to go through; but it is of no use to speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it _is_ of use,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``It would be of use
if you would treat me with some sort of pity and consideration,
instead of doing me vile injustice in your mind. I could bear
everything more quietly if I knew you didn't hate me for an insolent
coxcomb. Look at me; see what a hunted devil I am; I've been riding
thirty miles every day to get away from the thought of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie did not--dared not--look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had already seen the harassed
face. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said gently,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think any evil of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, dearest, look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, in deepest, tenderest tones
of entreaty. <div class="bookquote">``Don't go away from me yet. Give me a moment's happiness;
make me feel you've forgiven me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do forgive you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, shaken by those tones, and all
the more frightened at herself. <div class="bookquote">``But pray let me go in again. Pray go
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A great tear fell from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lowered eyelids.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't go away from you; I can't leave you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, with
still more passionate pleading. <div class="bookquote">``I shall come back again if you send
me away with this coldness; I can't answer for myself. But if you will
go with me only a little way I can live on that. You see plainly
enough that your anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie turned. But Tancred, the bay horse, began to make such spirited
remonstrances against this frequent change of direction, that Stephen,
catching sight of Willy Moss peeping through the gate, called out,
<div class="bookquote">``Here! just come and hold my horse for five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willy Moss</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``my aunt will think it so strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>Stephen answered impatiently; <div class="bookquote">``they don't know the
people at St. Ogg's. Lead him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) up and down just here for five minutes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) added to Willy, who was now close to them; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) turned to
Maggie's side, and they walked on. It was clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) _must_ go on
now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, entreatingly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took it, feeling
all the while as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were sliding downward in a nightmare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no end to this misery,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began, struggling to repel the
influence by speech. <div class="bookquote">``It is wicked--base--ever allowing a word or look
that Lucy--that others might not have seen. Think of Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)--bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). If I didn't--''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>Stephen had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
hand on Maggie's that rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm, and they both felt it
difficult to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have other ties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on, at last, with a desperate
effort, <div class="bookquote">``even if Lucy did not exist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are engaged to Philip Wakem?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, hastily. <div class="bookquote">``Is it so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider myself engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>); I don't mean to marry any one
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen was silent again until they had turned out of the sun into a
side lane, all grassy and sheltered. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) burst out impetuously,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is unnatural, it is horrible. Maggie, if you loved me as I love
you, we should throw everything else to the winds for the sake of
belonging to each other. We should break all these mistaken ties that
were made in blindness, and determine to marry each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather die than fall into that temptation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with
deep, slow distinctness, all the gathered spiritual force of painful
years coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aid in this extremity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, then, that you don't care for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, almost
violently. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me that you love some one else better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>It darted through Maggie's mind that here was a mode of releasing
herself from outward struggle,--to tell Stephen that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whole heart
was Philip's. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips would not utter that, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you do love me, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, gently, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand
again and laying it within his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``it is better--it is right that we
should marry each other. We can't help the pain it will give. It is
come upon us without our seeking; it is natural; it has taken hold of
me in spite of every effort I have made to resist it. God knows, I've
been trying to be faithful to tacit engagements, and I've only made
things worse; I'd better have given way at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was silent. If it were _not_ wrong--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were once convinced
of that, and need no longer beat and struggle against this current,
soft and yet strong as the summer stream!

<p/>``Say ``yes,<div class="bookquote">'' dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, leaning to look entreatingly in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``What could we care about in the whole world beside, if we
belonged to each other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breath was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) lips were very near hers, but there
was a great dread dwelling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips and eyelids quivered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes full on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) for an
instant, like a lovely wild animal timid and struggling under
caresses, and then turned sharp round toward home again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went on, in an impatient tone, trying to defeat
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own scruples as well as hers, <div class="bookquote">``I am breaking no positive
engagement; if Lucy's affections had been withdrawn from me and given
to some one else, I should have felt no right to assert a claim on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). If you are not absolutely pledged to Philip, we are neither of us
bound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't believe that; it is not your real feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``You feel, as I do, that the real tie lies in the feelings
and expectations we have raised in other minds. Else all pledges might
be broken, when there was no outward penalty. There would be no such
thing as faithfulness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen was silent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could not pursue that argument; the opposite
conviction had wrought in him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) too strongly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) previous time
of struggle. But it soon presented itself in a new form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pledge _can't_ be fulfilled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, with impetuous insistence.
<div class="bookquote">``It is unnatural; we can only pretend to give ourselves to any one
else. There is wrong in that too; there may be misery in it for _them_
as well as for us. Maggie, you must see that; you do see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was looking eagerly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face for the least sign of compliance;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) large, firm, gentle grasp was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was silent for a
few moments, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) drew a deep
breath, and said, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) with solemn sadness,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is difficult,--life is very difficult! It seems right to me
sometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling; but then, such
feelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has
made for us,--the ties that have made others dependent on us,--and
would cut them in two. If life were quite easy and simple, as it might
have been in Paradise, and we could always see that one being first
toward whom--I mean, if life did not make duties for us before love
comes, love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each
other. But I see--I feel it is not so now; there are things we must
renounce in life; some of us must resign love. Many things are
difficult and dark to me; but I see one thing quite clearly,--that I
must not, cannot, seek my own happiness by sacrificing others. Love is
natural; but surely pity and faithfulness and memory are natural too.
And they would live in me still, and punish me if I did not obey them.
I should be haunted by the suffering I had caused. Our love would be
poisoned. Don't urge me; help me,--help me, _because_ I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had become more and more earnest as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face had
become flushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes fuller and fuller of appealing love.
Stephen had the fibre of nobleness in him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) that vibrated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeal;
but in the same moment--how could it be otherwise?--that pleading
beauty gained new power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, in scarcely more than a whisper, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm
stole round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'll do, I'll bear anything you wish. But--one
kiss--one--the last--before we part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>One kiss, and then a long look, until Maggie said tremulously, <div class="bookquote">``Let me
go,--let me make haste back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hurried along, and not another word was spoken. Stephen stood
still and beckoned when they came within sight of Willy and the horse,
and Maggie went on through the gate. Mrs. Moss was standing alone at
the door of the old porch; she (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) had sent all the cousins in, with kind
thoughtfulness. It might be a joyful thing that Maggie had a rich and
handsome lover, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would naturally feel embarrassed at coming in
again; and it might _not_ be joyful. In either case Mrs. Moss waited
anxiously to receive Maggie by herself. The speaking face told plainly
enough that, if there was joy, it was of a very agitating, dubious
sort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down here a bit, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) drew Maggie into the porch, and
sat down on the bench by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); there was no privacy in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, aunt Gritty, I'm very wretched! I wish I could have died when I
was fifteen. It seemed so easy to give things up then; it is so hard
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor child threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunt's neck, and fell into
long, deep sobs.



<p/>Chapter XII

<p/>A Family Party


<p/>Maggie left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) good aunt Gritty at the end of the week, and went to
Garum Firs to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visit to aunt Pullet according to agreement. In
the mean time very unexpected things had happened, and there was to be
a family party at Garum to discuss and celebrate a change in the
fortunes of the Tullivers, which was likely finally to carry away the
shadow of their demerits like the last limb of an eclipse, and cause
their hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in full-rounded
splendor. It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into
office are not the only fellow-men who enjoy a period of high
appreciation and full-blown eulogy; in many respectable families
throughout this realm, relatives becoming creditable meet with a
similar cordiality of recognition, which in its fine freedom from the
coercion of any antecedents, suggests the hopeful possibility that we
may some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium,
with cockatrices who have ceased to bite, and wolves that no longer
show their teeth with any but the blandest intentions.

<p/>Lucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg; for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
longed to have some undisturbed talk with Maggie about the wonderful
news. It seemed, did it not? said Lucy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) prettiest air of
wisdom, as if everything, even other people's misfortunes -LRB-poor
creatures!-RRB- were conspiring now to make poor dear aunt Tulliver, and
cousin Tom, and naughty Maggie too, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were not obstinately bent
on the contrary, as happy as they deserved to be after all their
troubles. To think that the very day--the _very day_--after Tom had
come back from Newcastle, that unfortunate young Jetsome, whom Mr.
Wakem had placed at the Mill, had been pitched off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) horse in a
drunken fit, and was lying at St. Ogg's in a dangerous state, so that
Wakem had signified his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) wish that the new purchasers should enter on
the premises at once!

<p/>It was very dreadful for that unhappy young man, but it did seem as if
the misfortune had happened then, rather than at any other time, in
order that cousin Tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
exemplary conduct,--papa thought so very highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Aunt Tulliver
must certainly go to the Mill now, and keep house for Tom; that was
rather a loss to Lucy in the matter of household comfort; but then, to
think of poor aunty being in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) old place again, and gradually
getting comforts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) there!

<p/>On this last point Lucy had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cunning projects, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and
Maggie had made their dangerous way down the bright stairs into the
handsome parlor, where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner than
elsewhere, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) manœuvres, as any other great tactician
would have done, against the weaker side of the enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Pullet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, seating herself on the sofa, and caressingly
adjusting that lady's floating cap-string, <div class="bookquote">``I want you to make up your
mind what linen and things you will give Tom toward housekeeping;
because you are always so generous,--you give such nice things, you
know; and if you set the example, aunt Glegg will follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) never can, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, with unusual vigor,
<div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) hasn't got the linen to follow suit wi' mine, I can tell you.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'d niver the taste, not if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'d spend the money. Big checks and
live things, like stags and foxes, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) table-linen is,--not a spot
nor a diamond among 'em. But it's poor work dividing one's linen
before one dies,--I niver thought to ha' done that, Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Pullet continued, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) sister Tulliver,
<div class="bookquote">``when you and me chose the double diamont, the first flax iver we'd
spun, and the Lord knows where yours is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd no choice, I'm sure, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs. Tulliver, accustomed
to consider herself in the light of an accused person. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure it
was no wish o' mine, iver, as I should lie awake o' nights thinking o'
my best bleached linen all over the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a peppermint, Mrs. Tulliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said uncle Pullet, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>)
was offering a cheap and wholesome form of comfort, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) was
recommending by example.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but, aunt Pullet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``you've so much beautiful linen.
And suppose you had had daughters! Then you must have divided it when
they were married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't say as I won't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, <div class="bookquote">``for now Tom's
so lucky, it's nothing but right his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friends should look on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and
help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). There's the tablecloths I bought at your sale, Bessy; it was
nothing but good natur' o' me to buy 'em, for they've been lying in
the chest ever since. But I'm not going to give Maggie any more o' my
Indy muslin and things, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s to go into service again, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might stay and keep me company, and do my sewing for me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wasn't
wanted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going into service''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodson/Miss Dodson</b></font>)</div>was the expression by which the Dodson mind
represented to itself the position of teacher or governess; and
Maggie's return to that menial condition, now circumstances offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more eligible prospects, was likely to be a sore point with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) relatives, besides Lucy. Maggie in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) crude form, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hair
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) back, and altogether in a state of dubious promise, was a
most undesirable niece; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was capable of being at once
ornamental and useful. The subject was revived in aunt and uncle
Glegg's presence, over the tea and muffins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hegh, hegh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg, good-naturedly patting Maggie on the
back, <div class="bookquote">``nonsense, nonsense! Don't let us hear of you taking a place
again, Maggie. Why, you must ha' picked up half-a-dozen sweethearts at
the bazaar; isn't there one of 'em the right sort of article? Come,
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) wife, with that shade of increased politeness in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) severity which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) always put on with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crisper fronts, <div class="bookquote">``you'll
excuse me, but you're far too light for a man of your years. It's
respect and duty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aunts, and the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kin as are so good
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again
without consulting us; not sweethearts, if I'm to use such a word,
though it was never heared in _my_ family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what did they call us, when we went to see 'em, then, eh,
neighbor Pullet? They thought us sweet enough then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg,
winking pleasantly; while Mr. Pullet, at the suggestion of sweetness,
took a little more sugar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. G., <div class="bookquote">``if you're going to be undelicate, let me
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La, Jane, your husband's only joking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet; <div class="bookquote">``let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
joke while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s got health and strength. There's poor Mr. Tilt got his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
mouth drawn all o' one side, and couldn't laugh if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was to try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll trouble you for the muffineer, then, Mr. Glegg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. G.,
<div class="bookquote">``if I may be so bold to interrupt your joking. Though it's other
people must see the joke in a niece's putting a slight on her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mother's
eldest sister, as is the head o' the family; and only coming in and
out on short visits, all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'s been in the town, and then
settling to go away without my knowledge,--as I'd laid caps out on
purpose for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to make 'em up for me,--and me as have divided my
money so equal--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. G.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tulliver broke in anxiously, ``I'm sure Maggie never
thought o' going away without staying at your house as well as the
others. Not as it's my wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should go away at all, but quite
contrairy. I'm sure I'm innocent. I've said over and over again, ``My
dear, you've no call to go away.<div class="bookquote">'' But there's ten days or a fortnight
Maggie'll have before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s fixed to go; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) can stay at your house
just as well, and I'll step in when I can, and so will Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg, <div class="bookquote">``if you'd exercise a little more thought,
you might know I should hardly think it was worth while to unpin a
bed, and go to all that trouble now, just at the end o' the time, when
our house isn't above a quarter of an hour's walk from Mr. Deane's.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can come the first thing in the morning, and go back the last at
night, and be thankful she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s got a good aunt so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to come
and sit with. I know _I_ should, when I was her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La, Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pullet, <div class="bookquote">``it `ud do your beds good to have
somebody to sleep in 'em. There's that striped room smells dreadful
mouldy, and the glass mildewed like anything. I'm sure I thought I
should be struck with death when you took me in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pullet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there is Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucy, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s come on
Sindbad, as I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not going to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) entered, with strong feeling, at
this first meeting since the prospect of returning to the Mill had
been opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the chair by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side. To have no cloud between herself and Tom was still a
perpetual yearning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that had its root deeper than all change.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) very kindly this evening, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Magsie,
how's aunt Moss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Glegg putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you're
such a big man, you carry all before you, it, seems. You're come into
your luck a good deal earlier than us old folks did; but I wish you
joy, I wish you joy. You'll get the Mill all for your own again some
day, I'll be bound. You won't stop half-way up the hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll bear in mind as it's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's family as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owes
it to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glegg. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't had them to take after, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d
ha' been poorly off. There was never any failures, nor lawing, nor
wastefulness in our family, nor dying without wills--''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nor sudden deaths,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said aunt Pullet; <div class="bookquote">``allays the doctor called
in. But Tom had the Dodson skin; I said that from the first. And I
don't know what _you_ mean to do, sister Glegg, but I mean to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
a tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one, besides sheets. I
don't say what more I shall do; but _that_ I shall do, and if I should
die to-morrow, Mr. Pullet, you'll bear it in mind,--though you'll be
blundering with the keys, and never remember as that on the third
shelf o' the left-hand wardrobe, behind the night-caps with the broad
ties,--not the narrow-frilled uns,--is the key of the drawer in the
Blue Room, where the key o' the Blue Closet is. You'll make a mistake,
and I shall niver be worthy to know it. You've a memory for my pills
and draughts, wonderful,--I'll allays say that of you,--but you're
lost among the keys.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pullet/Mr. Pullet</b></font>)</div>This gloomy prospect of the confusion that would
ensue on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) decease was very affecting to Mrs. Pullet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You carry it too far, Sophy,--that locking in and out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Glegg, in a tone of some disgust at this folly. <div class="bookquote">``You go beyond your
own family. There's nobody can say I don't lock up; but I do what's
reasonable, and no more. And as for the linen, I shall look out what's
serviceable, to make a present of to my nephey; I've got cloth as has
never been whitened, better worth having than other people's fine
holland; and I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll lie down in it and think of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom thanked Mrs. Glegg, but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) virtues; and Mrs. Glegg effected a diversion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by asking
about Mr. Deane's intentions concerning steam.

<p/>Lucy had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) far-sighted views in begging Tom to come on Sindbad.
It appeared, when it was time to go home, that the man-servant was to
ride the horse, and cousin Tom was to drive home his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother and Lucy.
<div class="bookquote">``You must sit by yourself, aunty,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said that contriving young lady,
<div class="bookquote">``because I must sit by Tom; I've a great deal to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>In the eagerness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) affectionate anxiety for Maggie, Lucy could
not persuade herself to defer a conversation about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with Tom, who,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought, with such a cup of joy before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as this rapid
fulfilment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wish about the Mill, must become pliant and
flexible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nature supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with no key to Tom's; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
puzzled as well as pained to notice the unpleasant change on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
countenance when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the history of the way in which Philip
had used his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) influence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had counted on this
revelation as a great stroke of policy, which was to turn Tom's heart
toward Philip at once, and, besides that, prove that the elder Wakem
was ready to receive Maggie with all the honors of a daughter-in-law.
Nothing was wanted, then, but for dear Tom, who always had that
pleasant smile when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked at cousin Lucy, to turn completely
round, say the opposite of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always said before, and declare
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) part, was delighted that all the old grievances
should be healed, and that Maggie should have Philip with all suitable
despatch; in cousin Lucy's opinion nothing could be easier.

<p/>But to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities
that create severity,--strength of will, conscious rectitude of
purpose, narrowness of imagination and intellect, great power of
self-control, and a disposition to exert control over others,--prejudices
come as the natural food of tendencies which can get no sustenance
out of that complex, fragmentary, doubt-provoking knowledge which
we call truth. Let a prejudice be bequeathed, carried in the air,
adopted by hearsay, caught in through the eye,--however it may come,
these minds will give it a habitation; it is something to assert
strongly and bravely, something to fill up the void of spontaneous
ideas, something to impose on others with the authority of conscious
right; it is at once a staff and a baton. Every prejudice that will
answer these purposes is self-evident. Our good, upright Tom Tulliver's
mind was of this class; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) inward criticism of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) father's faults
did not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) from adopting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) father's prejudice; it was a
prejudice against a man of lax principle and lax life, and it was a
meeting-point for all the disappointed feelings of family and personal
pride. Other feelings added their force to produce Tom's bitter
repugnance to Philip, and to Maggie's union with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); and
notwithstanding Lucy's power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) strong-willed cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) got
nothing but a cold refusal ever to sanction such a marriage; <div class="bookquote">``but of
course Maggie could do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) liked,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
determination to be independent. For Tom's part, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held himself bound
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's memory, and by every manly feeling, never
to consent to any relation with the Wakems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus, all that Lucy had effected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) zealous mediation was to fill
Tom's mind with the expectation that Maggie's perverse resolve to go
into a situation again would presently metamorphose itself, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
resolves were apt to do, into something equally perverse, but entirely
different,--a marriage with Philip Wakem.



<p/>Chapter XIII

<p/>Borne Along by the Tide


<p/>In less than a week Maggie was at St. Ogg's again,--outwardly in much
the same position as when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visit there had just begun. It was easy
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mornings apart from Lucy without any obvious
effort; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) promised visits to pay to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) aunt Glegg, and
it was natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother more than usual of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
companionship in these last weeks, especially as there were
preparations to be thought of for Tom's housekeeping. But Lucy would
hear of no pretext for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remaining away in the evenings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must
always come from aunt Glegg's before dinner,--<div class="bookquote">``else what shall I have
of you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glegg/Glegg</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with a tearful pout that could not be resisted.

<p/>And Mr. Stephen Guest had unaccountably taken to dining at Mr. Deane's
as often as possible, instead of avoiding that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) used to do. At
first he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) began his (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) mornings with a resolution that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) would not dine
there, not even go in the evening, till Maggie was away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had even
devised a plan of starting off on a journey in this agreeable June
weather; the headaches which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) had constantly been alleging as a
ground for stupidity and silence were a sufficient ostensible motive.
But the journey was not taken, and by the fourth morning no distinct
resolution was formed about the evenings; they were only foreseen as
times when Maggie would still be present for a little while,--when one
more touch, one more glance, might be snatched. For why not? There was
nothing to conceal between them; they knew, they had confessed their
love, and they had renounced each other; they were going to part.
Honor and conscience were going to divide them; Maggie, with that
appeal from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inmost soul, had decided it; but surely they might
cast a lingering look at each other across the gulf, before they
turned away never to look again till that strange light had forever
faded out of their eyes.

<p/>Maggie, all this time, moved about with a quiescence and even torpor
of manner, so contrasted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) usual fitful brightness and ardor,
that Lucy would have had to seek some other cause for such a change,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not been convinced that the position in which Maggie stood
between Philip and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother, and the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) self-imposed
wearisome banishment, were quite enough to account for a large amount
of depression. But under this torpor there was a fierce battle of
emotions, such as Maggie in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life of struggle had never known
or foreboded; it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as if all the worst evil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
lain in ambush till now, and had suddenly started up full-armed, with
hideous, overpowering strength! There were moments in which a cruel
selfishness seemed to be getting possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); why should not
Lucy, why should not Philip, suffer? _She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_ had had to suffer through
many years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life; and who had renounced anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)? And
when something like that fulness of existence--love, wealth, ease,
refinement, all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) nature craved--was brought within her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) reach,
why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to forego it, that another might have it,--another, who
perhaps needed it less? But amidst all this new passionate tumult
there were the old voices making themselves heard with rising power,
till, from time to time, the tumult seemed quelled. _Was_ that
existence which tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the full existence she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dreamed? Where,
then, would be all the memories of early striving; all the deep pity
for another's pain, which had been nurtured in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) through years of
affection and hardship; all the divine presentiment of something
higher than mere personal enjoyment, which had made the sacredness of
life? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might as well hope to enjoy walking by maiming her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet, as
hope to enjoy an existence in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) set out by maiming the faith
and sympathy that were the best organs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soul. And then, if pain
were so hard to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_, what was it to others? <div class="bookquote">``Ah, God! preserve me
from inflicting--give me strength to bear it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>How had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sunk into
this struggle with a temptation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would once have thought
herself as secure from as from deliberate crime? When was that first
hateful moment in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been conscious of a feeling that
clashed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken
it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with horror, as if it had been a loathsome thing? And yet,
since this strange, sweet, subduing influence did not, should not,
conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),--since it was to remain simply her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own suffering,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
mind was meeting Stephen's in that thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), that they might
still snatch moments of mute confession before the parting came. For
was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) suffering too? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw it daily--saw it in the sickened
look of fatigue with which, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was not compelled to exert
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) relapsed into indifference toward everything but the
possibility of watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) refuse sometimes to answer that
beseeching look which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt to be following her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) like a low murmur
of love and pain? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) refused it less and less, till at last the
evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment's mutual gaze;
they thought of it till it came, and when it had come, they thought of
nothing else.

<p/>One other thing Stephen seemed now and then to care for, and that was
to sing; it was a way of speaking to Maggie. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was not
distinctly conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was impelled to it by a secret
longing--running counter to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) self-confessed resolves--to deepen
the hold he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Watch your own speech, and notice how it is
guided by your less conscious purposes, and you will understand that
contradiction in Stephen.

<p/>Philip Wakem was a less frequent visitor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) came occasionally in
the evening, and it happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was there when Lucy said, as they
sat out on the lawn, near sunset,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Maggie's tale of visits to aunt Glegg is completed, I mean that
we shall go out boating every day until she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) goes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has not had half
enough boating because of these tiresome visits, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) likes it
better than anything. Don't you, Maggie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better than any sort of locomotion, I hope you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip,
smiling at Maggie, who was lolling backward in a low garden-chair;
<div class="bookquote">``else she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will be selling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soul to that ghostly boatman who haunts
the Floss, only for the sake of being drifted in a boat forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) boatman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``Because, if you
would, you can come with us and take an oar. If the Floss were but a
quiet lake instead of a river, we should be independent of any
gentleman, for Maggie can row splendidly. As it is, we are reduced to
ask services of knights and squires, who do not seem to offer them
with great alacrity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked playful reproach at Stephen, who was sauntering up and
down, and was just singing in pianissimo falsetto,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) took no notice, but still kept aloof; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had done so frequently
during Philip's recent visits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem inclined for boating,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) came to sit
down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on the bench. <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't rowing suit you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hate a large party in a boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, almost irritably. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
come when you have no one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy colored, fearing that Philip would be hurt; it was quite a new
thing for Stephen to speak in that way; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had certainly not been
well of late. Philip colored too, but less from a feeling of personal
offence than from a vague suspicion that Stephen's moodiness had some
relation to Maggie, who had started up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) spoke, and
had walked toward the hedge of laurels to look at the descending
sunlight on the river.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As Miss Deane didn't know she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) was excluding others by inviting me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>said Philip, <div class="bookquote">``I am bound to resign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, you shall not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, much vexed. <div class="bookquote">``I particularly
wish for your company to-morrow. The tide will suit at half-past ten;
it will be a delicious time for a couple of hours to row to Luckreth
and walk back, before the sun gets too hot. And how can you object to
four people in a boat?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) added, looking at Stephen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't object to the people, but the number,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, who had
recovered himself, and was rather ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) rudeness. <div class="bookquote">``If I voted
for a fourth at all, of course it would be you, Phil. But we won't
divide the pleasure of escorting the ladies; we'll take it
alternately. I'll go the next day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div><p/>This incident had the effect of drawing Philip's attention with
freshened solicitude toward Stephen and Maggie; but when they
re-entered the house, music was proposed, and Mrs. Tulliver and Mr.
Deane being occupied with cribbage, Maggie sat apart near the table
where the books and work were placed, doing nothing, however, but
listening abstractedly to the music. Stephen presently turned to a
duet which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) insisted that Lucy and Philip should sing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had often
done the same thing before; but this evening Philip thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) divined
some double intention in every word and look of Stephen's, and watched
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) keenly, angry with himself all the while for this clinging
suspicion. For had not Maggie virtually denied any ground for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
doubts on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was truth itself; it was impossible not to
believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) word and glance when they had last spoken together in the
garden. Stephen might be strongly fascinated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) -LRB-what was more
natural?-RRB-, but Philip felt himself rather base for intruding on what
must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friend's painful secret. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) watched. Stephen, moving
away from the piano, sauntered slowly toward the table near which
Maggie sat, and turned over the newspapers, apparently in mere
idleness. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) seated himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) back to the piano, dragging
a newspaper under his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) elbow, and thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hair,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been attracted by some bit of local news in the <div class="bookquote">``Laceham
Courier.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was in reality looking at Maggie who had not taken the
slightest notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) approach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had always additional strength
of resistance when Philip was present, just as we can restrain our
speech better in a spot that we feel to be hallowed. But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
heard the word <div class="bookquote">``dearest''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>uttered in the softest tone of pained
entreaty, like that of a patient who asks for something that ought to
have been given without asking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never heard that word since
the moments in the lane at Basset, when it had come from Stephen again
and again, almost as involuntarily as if it had been an inarticulate
cry. Philip could hear no word, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had moved to the opposite side
of the piano, and could see Maggie start and blush, raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes an
instant toward Stephen's face, but immediately look apprehensively
toward himself. It was not evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that Philip had observed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); but a pang of shame, under the sense of this concealment, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) move from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair and walk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's side to watch the
game at cribbage.

<p/>Philip went home soon after in a state of hideous doubt mingled with
wretched certainty. It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) now to resist the
conviction that there was some mutual consciousness between Stephen
and Maggie; and for half the night his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) irritable, susceptible nerves
were pressed upon almost to frenzy by that one wretched fact; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could
attempt no explanation that would reconcile it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) words and
actions. When, at last, the need for belief in Maggie rose to its
habitual predominance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was not long in imagining the truth,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was struggling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was banishing herself; this was the clue to all he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
had seen since his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) return. But athwart that belief there came other
possibilities that would not be driven out of sight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) imagination
wrought out the whole story; Stephen was madly in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
must have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and was hurrying away.
But would he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) up, knowing--Philip felt the fact with
heart-crushing despair--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was made half helpless by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feeling
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)?

<p/>When the morning came, Philip was too ill to think of keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
engagement to go in the boat. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) present agitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could decide
on nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could only alternate between contradictory intentions.
First, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must have an interview with Maggie, and entreat
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to confide in him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); then, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) distrusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own
interference. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not been thrusting himself on Maggie all along?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had uttered words long ago in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) young ignorance; it was enough
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that these should be continually present with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
as a bond. And had he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) any right to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for a revelation of
feelings which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had evidently intended to withhold from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
would not trust himself to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had assured himself that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could act from pure anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and not from egoistic
irritation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wrote a brief note to Stephen, and sent it early by the
servant, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was not well enough to fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) engagement
to Miss Deane. Would Stephen take his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) excuse, and fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) place?

<p/>Lucy had arranged a charming plan, which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) quite content
with Stephen's refusal to go in the boat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
father was to drive to Lindum this morning at ten; Lindum was the very
place she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wanted to go to, to make purchases,--important purchases,
which must by no means be put off to another opportunity; and aunt
Tulliver must go too, because she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was concerned in some of the
purchases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will have your row in the boat just the same, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said
to Maggie when they went out of the breakfast-room and upstairs
together; <div class="bookquote">``Philip will be here it half-past ten, and it is a delicious
morning. Now don't say a word against it, you dear dolorous thing.
What is the use of my being a fairy godmother, if you set your face
against all the wonders I work for you? Don't think of awful cousin
Tom; you may disobey him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie did not persist in objecting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was almost glad of the plan,
for perhaps it would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) some strength and calmness to be alone
with Philip again; it was like revisiting the scene of a quieter life,
in which the very struggles were repose, compared with the daily
tumult of the present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) prepared herself for the boat and at
half-past ten sat waiting in the drawing-room.

<p/>The ring of the door-bell was punctual, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was thinking with
half-sad, affectionate pleasure of the surprise Philip would have in
finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) alone, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) distinguished a
firm, rapid step across the hall, that was certainly not Philip's; the
door opened, and Stephen Guest entered.

<p/>In the first moment they were both too much agitated to speak; for
Stephen had learned from the servant that the others were gone out.
Maggie had started up and sat down again, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart beating
violently; and Stephen, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) cap and gloves, came and sat
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought Philip would be coming soon; and with
great effort--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) trembled visibly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rose to go to a distant
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, in a low tone. <div class="bookquote">``I am going in the
boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we can't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, sinking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chair again. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy
did not expect--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would be hurt. Why is not Philip come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is not well; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked me to come instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy is gone to Lindum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet with
hurried, trembling fingers. <div class="bookquote">``We must not go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, dreamily, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
arm on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Then we'll stay here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deep, deep eyes, far off and mysterious at the
starlit blackness, and yet very near, and timidly loving. Maggie sat
perfectly still--perhaps for moments, perhaps for minutes--until the
helpless trembling had ceased, and there was a warm glow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) check.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is waiting; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has taken the cushions,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Will you
go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, almost in a whisper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was
looking at the lips now.

<p/>Maggie made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>Stephen murmured entreatingly, rising, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) too. <div class="bookquote">``We shall not be long together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And they went. Maggie felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was being led down the garden
among the roses, being helped with firm, tender care into the boat,
having the cushion and cloak arranged for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) parasol
opened for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) -LRB-which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had forgotten-RRB-, all by this stronger
presence that seemed to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) along without any act of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
will, like the added self which comes with the sudden exalting
influence of a strong tonic, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt nothing else. Memory was
excluded.

<p/>They glided rapidly along, Stephen rowing, helped by the
backward-flowing tide, past the Tofton trees and houses; on between
the silent sunny fields and pastures, which seemed filled with a
natural joy that had no reproach for theirs. The breath of the young,
unwearied day, the delicious rhythmic dip of the oars, the fragmentary
song of a passing bird heard now and then, as if it were only the
overflowing of brimful gladness, the sweet solitude of a twofold
consciousness that was mingled into one by that grave, untiring gaze
which need not be averted,--what else could there be in their minds
for the first hour? Some low, subdued, languid exclamation of love
came from Stephen from time to time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went on rowing idly, half
automatically; otherwise they spoke no word; for what could words have
been but an inlet to thought? and thought did not belong to that
enchanted haze in which they were enveloped,--it belonged to the past
and the future that lay outside the haze. Maggie was only dimly
conscious of the banks, as they passed them, and dwelt with no
recognition on the villages; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew there were several to be passed
before they reached Luckreth, where they always stopped and left the
boat. At all times she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was so liable to fits of absence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
likely enough to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) waymarks pass unnoticed.

<p/>But at last Stephen, who had been rowing more and more idly, ceased to
row, laid down the oars, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arms, and looked down on the water
as if watching the pace at which the boat glided without his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) help.
This sudden change roused Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked at the far-stretching
fields, at the banks close by, and felt that they were entirely
strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). A terrible alarm took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, have we passed Luckreth, where we were to stop?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) exclaimed,
looking back to see if the place were out of sight. No village was to
be seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned around again, with a look of distressed
questioning at Stephen.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went on watching the water, and said, in a strange, dreamy, absent
tone, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, a long way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>cried Maggie, in an agony. <div class="bookquote">``We shall not get
home for hours, and Lucy? O God, help me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands and broke into a sob, like a frightened child;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought of nothing but of meeting Lucy, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) look of
pained surprise and doubt, perhaps of just upbraiding.

<p/>Stephen moved and sat near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and gently drew down the clasped
hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, in a deep tone of slow decision, <div class="bookquote">``let us never go
home again, till no one can part us,--till we are married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The unusual tone, the startling words, arrested Maggie's sob, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
sat quite still, wondering; as if Stephen might have seen some
possibilities that would alter everything, and annul the wretched
facts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, Maggie, how everything has come without our seeking,--in spite
of all our efforts. We never thought of being alone together again; it
has all been done by others. See how the tide is carrying us out, away
from all those unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster
round us, and trying in vain. It will carry us on to Torby, and we can
land there, and get some carriage, and hurry on to York and then to
Scotland,--and never pause a moment till we are bound to each other,
so that only death can part us. It is the only right thing, dearest;
it is the only way of escaping from this wretched entanglement.
Everything has concurred to point it out to us. We have contrived
nothing, we have thought of nothing ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen spoke with deep, earnest pleading. Maggie listened, passing
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that
the tide was doing it all, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might glide along with the swift,
silent stream, and not struggle any more. But across that stealing
influence came the terrible shadow of past thoughts; and the sudden
horror lest now, at last, the moment of fatal intoxication was close
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), called up feelings of angry resistance toward Stephen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, in an agitated tone, flashing an indignant look
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and trying to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands free. <div class="bookquote">``You have wanted to deprive
me of any choice. You knew we were come too far; you have dared to
take advantage of my thoughtlessness. It is unmanly to bring me into
such a position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Stung by this reproach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) released her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands, moved back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
former place, and folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arms, in a sort of desperation at the
difficulty Maggie's words had made present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would not
consent to go on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) must curse himself for the embarrassment he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had
led her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into. But the reproach was the unendurable thing; the one
thing worse than parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had
acted unworthily toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, in a tone of suppressed
rage,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't notice that we had passed Luckreth till we had got to the
next village; and then it came into my mind that we would go on. I
can't justify it; I ought to have told you. It is enough to make you
hate me, since you don't love me well enough to make everything else
indifferent to you, as I do you. Shall I stop the boat and try to get
you out here? I'll tell Lucy that I was mad, and that you hate me; and
you shall be clear of me forever. No one can blame you, because I have
behaved unpardonably to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was paralyzed; it was easier to resist Stephen's pleading than
this picture he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had called up of himself suffering while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
vindicated; easier even to turn away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) look of tenderness than
from this look of angry misery, that seemed to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in selfish
isolation from him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had called up a state of feeling in which the
reasons which had acted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conscience seemed to be transmitted
into mere self-regard. The indignant fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes was quenched,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) with timid distress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had reproached
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) for being hurried into irrevocable trespass,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), who had been so
weak herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if I shouldn't feel what happened to you--just the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
said, with reproach of another kind,--the reproach of love, asking for
more trust. This yielding to the idea of Stephen's suffering was more
fatal than the other yielding, because it was less distinguishable
from that sense of others' claims which was the moral basis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
resistance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) felt all the relenting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) look and tone; it was heaven opening
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) moved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) elbow on
the back of the boat, and saying nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) dreaded to utter another
word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) dreaded to make another movement, that might provoke another
reproach or denial from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Life hung on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consent; everything else
was hopeless, confused, sickening misery. They glided along in this
way, both resting in that silence as in a haven, both dreading lest
their feelings should be divided again,--till they became aware that
the clouds had gathered, and that the slightest perceptible freshening
of the breeze was growing and growing, so that the whole character of
the day was altered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be chill, Maggie, in this thin dress. Let me raise the cloak
over your shoulders. Get up an instant, dearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie obeyed; there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to
do, and having everything decided for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat down again covered
with the cloak, and Stephen took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) oars again, making haste; for
they must try to get to Torby as fast as they could. Maggie was hardly
conscious of having said or done anything decisive. All yielding is
attended with a less vivid consciousness than resistance; it is the
partial sleep of thought; it is the submergence of our own personality
by another. Every influence tended to lull her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into acquiescence. That
dreamy gliding in the boat which had lasted for four hours, and had
brought some weariness and exhaustion; the recoil of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fatigued
sensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the
boat at this unknown distance from home, and walking for long
miles,--all helped to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into more complete subjection to that
strong, mysterious charm which made a last parting from Stephen seem
the death of all joy, and made the thought of wounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) like the
first touch of the torturing iron before which resolution shrank. And
then there was the present happiness of being with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), which was
enough to absorb all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) languid energy.

<p/>Presently Stephen observed a vessel coming after them. Several
vessels, among them the steamer to Mudport, had passed them with the
early tide, but for the last hour they had seen none. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) looked more
and more eagerly at this vessel, as if a new thought had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
mind along with it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) looked at Maggie hesitatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``if this vessel should be going to
Mudport, or to any convenient place on the coast northward, it would
be our best plan to get them to take us on board. You are fatigued,
and it may soon rain; it may be a wretched business, getting to Torby
in this boat. It's only a trading vessel, but I dare say you can be
made tolerably comfortable. We'll take the cushions out of the boat.
It is really our best plan. They'll be glad enough to take us. I've
got plenty of money about me. I can pay them well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new
proposition; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was silent,--one course seemed as difficult as
another.

<p/>Stephen hailed the vessel. It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport, the
English mate informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and, if this wind held, would be there in
less than two days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had got out too far with our boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">``I was trying to
make for Torby. But I'm afraid of the weather; and this lady--my
wife--will be exhausted with fatigue and hunger. Take us on
board--will you?--and haul up the boat. I'll pay you well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, now really faint and trembling with fear, was taken on board,
making an interesting object of contemplation to admiring Dutchmen.
The mate feared the lady would have a poor time of it on board, for
they had no accommodation for such entirely unlooked-for
passengers,--no private cabin larger than an old-fashioned church-pew.
But at least they had Dutch cleanliness, which makes all other
inconveniences tolerable; and the boat cushions were spread into a
couch for Maggie on the poop with all alacrity. But to pace up and
down the deck leaning on Stephen--being upheld by his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) strength--was
the first change that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) needed; then came food, and then quiet
reclining on the cushions, with the sense that no new resolution
_could_ be taken that day. Everything must wait till to-morrow.
Stephen sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>); they could only speak to
each other in low tones; only look at each other now and then, for it
would take a long while to dull the curiosity of the five men on
board, and reduce these handsome young strangers to that minor degree
of interest which belongs, in a sailor's regard, to all objects nearer
than the horizon. But Stephen was triumphantly happy. Every other
thought or care was thrown into unmarked perspective by the certainty
that Maggie must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). The leap had been taken now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been
tortured by scruples, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had fought fiercely with overmastering
inclination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had hesitated; but repentance was impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
murmured forth in fragmentary sentences his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) happiness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) adoration,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) tenderness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) belief that their life together must be heaven,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presence with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would give rapture to every common day;
that to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lightest wish was dearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) than all other
bliss; that everything was easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sake, except to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>);
and now they never _would_ part; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) forever, and
all that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was hers,--had no value for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) except as it was
hers. Such things, uttered in low, broken tones by the one voice that
has first stirred the fibre of young passion, have only a feeble
effect--on experienced minds at a distance from them. To poor Maggie
they were very near; they were like nectar held close to thirsty lips;
there was, there _must_ be, then, a life for mortals here below which
was not hard and chill,--in which affection would no longer be
self-sacrifice. Stephen's passionate words made the vision of such a
life more fully present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) than it had ever been before; and the
vision for the time excluded all realities,--all except the returning
sun-gleams which broke out on the waters as the evening approached,
and mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised happiness; all
except the hand that pressed hers, and the voice that spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
and the eyes that looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with grave, unspeakable love.

<p/>There was to be no rain, after all; the clouds rolled off to the
horizon again, making the great purple rampart and long purple isles
of that wondrous land which reveals itself to us when the sun goes
down,--the land that the evening star watches over. Maggie was to
sleep all night on the poop; it was better than going below; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was covered with the warmest wrappings the ship could furnish. It was
still early, when the fatigues of the day brought on a drowsy longing
for perfect rest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, looking at the faint,
dying flush in the west, where the one golden lamp was getting
brighter and brighter. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked up at Stephen, who was still
seated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm against the
vessel's side. Behind all the delicious visions of these last hours,
which had flowed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) like a soft stream, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) entirely
passive, there was the dim consciousness that the condition was a
transient one, and that the morrow must bring back the old life of
struggle; that there were thoughts which would presently avenge
themselves for this oblivion. But now nothing was distinct to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was being lulled to sleep with that soft stream still flowing over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), with those delicious visions melting and fading like the wondrous
aerial land of the west.



<p/>Chapter XIV

<p/>Waking


<p/>When Maggie was gone to sleep, Stephen, weary too with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
unaccustomed amount of rowing, and with the intense inward life of the
last twelve hours, but too restless to sleep, walked and lounged about
the deck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) cigar far on into midnight, not seeing the dark
water, hardly conscious there were stars, living only in the near and
distant future. At last fatigue conquered restlessness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) rolled
himself up in a piece of tarpaulin on the deck near Maggie's feet.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had fallen asleep before nine, and had been sleeping for six hours
before the faintest hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
awoke from that vivid dreaming which makes the margin of our deeper
rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was in a boat on the wide water with Stephen, and in the
gathering darkness something like a star appeared, that grew and grew
till they saw it was the Virgin seated in St. Ogg's boat, and it came
nearer and nearer, till they saw the Virgin was Lucy and the boatman
was Philip,--no, not Philip, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother, who rowed past without
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rose to stretch out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arms and call to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
and their own boat turned over with the movement, and they began to
sink, till with one spasm of dread she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) seemed to awake, and find she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was a child again in the parlor at evening twilight, and Tom was not
really angry. From the soothed sense of that false waking she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) passed
to the real waking,--to the plash of water against the vessel, and the
sound of a footstep on the deck, and the awful starlit sky. There was
a moment of utter bewilderment before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind could get disentangled
from the confused web of dreams; but soon the whole terrible truth
urged itself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). Stephen was not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was alone with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own memory and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own dread. The irrevocable wrong that must blot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life had been committed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had brought sorrow into the lives of
others,--into the lives that were knit up with hers by trust and love.
The feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into the sins her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
nature had most recoiled from,--breach of faith and cruel selfishness;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty, and had made
herself an outlawed soul, with no guide but the wayward choice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
own passion. And where would that lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)? Where had it led her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) now?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would rather die than fall into that temptation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
felt it now,--now that the consequences of such a fall had come before
the outward act was completed. There was at least this fruit from all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) years of striving after the highest and best,--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soul
though betrayed, beguiled, ensnared, could never deliberately consent
to a choice of the lower. And a choice of what? O God! not a choice of
joy, but of conscious cruelty and hardness; for could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) ever cease
to see before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) Lucy and Philip, with their murdered trust and
hopes? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life with Stephen could have no sacredness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must
forever sink and wander vaguely, driven by uncertain impulse; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
had let go the clue of life,--that clue which once in the far-off
years her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) young need had clutched so strongly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had renounced all
delights then, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew them, before they had come within her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
reach. Philip had been right when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew nothing of
renunciation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had thought it was quiet ecstasy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw it face to
face now,--that sad, patient, loving strength which holds the clue of
life,--and saw that the thorns were forever pressing on its brow. The
yesterday, which could never be revoked,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could have changed it
now for any length of inward silent endurance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have bowed
beneath that cross with a sense of rest.

<p/>Day break came and the reddening eastern light, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) past life
was grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in this way, with that tightening clutch which comes
in the last moments of possible rescue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could see Stephen now
lying on the deck still fast asleep, and with the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) there
came a wave of anguish that found its way in a long-suppressed sob.
The worst bitterness of parting--the thought that urged the sharpest
inward cry for help--was the pain it must give to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)_. But
surmounting everything was the horror at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own possible failure, the
dread lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) conscience should be benumbed again, and not rise to
energy till it was too late. Too late! it was too late already not to
have caused misery; too late for everything, perhaps, but to rush away
from the last act of baseness,--the tasting of joys that were wrung
from crushed hearts.

<p/>The sun was rising now, and Maggie started up with the sense that a
day of resistance was beginning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyelashes were still wet
with tears, as, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat looking at the
slowly rounding sun. Something roused Stephen too, and getting up from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hard bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) came to sit beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). The sharp instinct of anxious
love saw something to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) alarm in the very first glance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had
a hovering dread of some resistance in Maggie's nature that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would
be unable to overcome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had the uneasy consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had
robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of perfect freedom yesterday; there was too much native
honor in him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) not to feel that, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will should recoil, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
conduct would have been odious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have a right to reproach
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).

<p/>But Maggie did not feel that right; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was too conscious of fatal
weakness in herself, too full of the tenderness that comes with the
foreseen need for inflicting a wound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) came to sit down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), only with rather a
sad glance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could say nothing to pain him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) till the moment of
possible parting was nearer. And so they drank their cup of coffee
together, and walked about the deck, and heard the captain's assurance
that they should be in at Mudport by five o'clock, each with an inward
burthen; but in him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) it was an undefined fear, which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) trusted to the
coming hours to dissipate; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) it was a definite resolve on which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was trying silently to tighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hold. Stephen was continually,
through the morning, expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) anxiety at the fatigue and
discomfort she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was suffering, and alluded to landing and to the change
of motion and repose she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have in a carriage, wanting to assure
himself more completely by presupposing that everything would be as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
had arranged it. For a long while Maggie contented herself with
assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had had a good night's rest, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't
mind about being on the vessel,--it was not like being on the open
sea, it was only a little less pleasant than being in a boat on the
Floss. But a suppressed resolve will betray itself in the eyes, and
Stephen became more and more uneasy as the day advanced, under the
sense that Maggie had entirely lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) passiveness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) longed, but
did not dare, to speak of their marriage, of where they would go after
it, and the steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would take to inform his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) father, and the rest, of
what had happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) longed to assure himself of a tacit assent from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) gathered a stronger dread of
the new, quiet sadness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) eyes. And they were more
and more silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are in sight of Mudport,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``Now, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
added, turning toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with a look that was half beseeching, <div class="bookquote">``the
worst part of your fatigue is over. On the land we can command
swiftness. In another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise
together, and that will seem rest to you after this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie felt it was time to speak; it would only be unkind now to
assent by silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke in the lowest tone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had done, but
with distinct decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall not be together; we shall have parted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>The blood rushed to Stephen's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll die first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had dreaded--there was a struggle coming. But neither of
them dared to say another word till the boat was let down, and they
were taken to the landing-place. Here there was a cluster of gazers
and passengers awaiting the departure of the steamboat to St. Ogg's.
Maggie had a dim sense, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had landed, and Stephen was hurrying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm, that some one had advanced toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from that
cluster as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) were coming to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was hurried
along, and was indifferent to everything but the coming trial.

<p/>A porter guided them to the nearest inn and posting-house, and Stephen
gave the order for the chaise as they passed through the yard. Maggie
took no notice of this, and only said, <div class="bookquote">``Ask them to show us into a
room where we can sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>When they entered, Maggie did not sit down, and Stephen, whose face
had a desperate determination in it, was about to ring the bell, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, in a firm voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going; we must part here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, turning round toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and speaking in the tones
of a man who feels a process of torture beginning, <div class="bookquote">``do you mean to
kill me? What is the use of it now? The whole thing is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is not done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Too much is done,--more than we
can ever remove the trace of. But I will go no farther. Don't try to
prevail with me again. I couldn't choose yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dared not go near her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anger might leap out,
and make a new barrier. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked backward and forward in maddening
perplexity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at last, pausing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and speaking in a tone
of imploring wretchedness, <div class="bookquote">``have some pity--hear me--forgive me for
what I did yesterday. I will obey you now; I will do nothing without
your full consent. But don't blight our lives forever by a rash
perversity that can answer no good purpose to any one, that can only
create new evils. Sit down, dearest; wait--think what you are going to
do. Don't treat me as if you couldn't trust me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had chosen the most effective appeal; but Maggie's will was fixed
unswervingly on the coming wrench. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind to suffer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, in a low but distinct voice; <div class="bookquote">``we must
part at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We _can't_ part, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, more impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``I can't
bear it. What is the use of inflicting that misery on me? The
blow--whatever it may have been--has been struck now. Will it help any
one else that you should drive me mad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not begin any future, even for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, tremulously,
<div class="bookquote">``with a deliberate consent to what ought not to have been. What I told
you at Basset I feel now; I would rather have died than fall into this
temptation. It would have been better if we had parted forever then.
But we must part now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will _not_ part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>Stephen burst out, instinctively placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
back against the door, forgetting everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had said a few moments
before; <div class="bookquote">``I will not endure it. You'll make me desperate; I sha'n't
know what I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie trembled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt that the parting could not be effected
suddenly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must rely on a slower appeal to Stephen's better self;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must be prepared for a harder task than that of rushing away while
resolution was fresh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat down. Stephen, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with that
look of desperation which had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) like a lurid light,
approached slowly from the door, seated himself close beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and
grasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart beat like the heart of a frightened bird;
but this direct opposition helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) determination
growing stronger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember what you felt weeks ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began, with beseeching
earnestness; <div class="bookquote">``remember what we both felt,--that we owed ourselves to
others, and must conquer every inclination which could make us false
to that debt. We have failed to keep our resolutions; but the wrong
remains the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it does _not_ remain the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">``We have proved
that it was impossible to keep our resolutions. We have proved that
the feeling which draws us toward each other is too strong to be
overcome. That natural law surmounts every other; we can't help what
it clashes with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so, Stephen; I'm quite sure that is wrong. I have tried to
think it again and again; but I see, if we judged in that way, there
would be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty; we should justify
breaking the most sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth. If the
past is not to bind us, where can duty lie? We should have no law but
the inclination of the moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there are ties that can't be kept by mere resolution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said
Stephen, starting up and walking about again. <div class="bookquote">``What is outward
faithfulness? Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as
constancy without love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie did not answer immediately. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was undergoing an inward as
well as an outward contest. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, with a passionate
assertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conviction, as much against herself as against him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>),--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That seems right--at first; but when I look further, I'm sure it is
_not_ right. Faithfulness and constancy mean something else besides
doing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves. They mean
renouncing whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in
us,--whatever would cause misery to those whom the course of our lives
has made dependent on us. If we--if I had been better, nobler, those
claims would have been so strongly present with me,--I should have
felt them pressing on my heart so continually, just as they do now in
the moments when my conscience is awake,--that the opposite feeling
would never have grown in me, as it has done; it would have been
quenched at once, I should have prayed for help so earnestly, I should
have rushed away as we rush from hideous danger. I feel no excuse for
myself, none. I should never have failed toward Lucy and Philip as I
have done, if I had not been weak, selfish, and hard,--able to think
of their pain without a pain to myself that would have destroyed all
temptation. Oh, what is Lucy feeling now? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) believed in me--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
loved me--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was so good to me. Think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's voice was getting choked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) uttered these last words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I _can't_ think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, stamping as if with pain. <div class="bookquote">``I
can think of nothing but you, Maggie. You demand of a man what is
impossible. I felt that once; but I can't go back to it now. And where
is the use of _your_ thinking of it, except to torture me? You can't
save them from pain now; you can only tear yourself from me, and make
my life worthless to me. And even if we could go back, and both fulfil
our engagements,--if that were possible now,--it would be hateful,
horrible, to think of your ever being Philip's wife,--of your ever
being the wife of a man you didn't love. We have both been rescued
from a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>A deep flush came over Maggie's face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't speak. Stephen
saw this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) sat down again, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with passionate entreaty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie! Dearest! If you love me, you are mine. Who can have so great
a claim on you as I have? My life is bound up in your love. There is
nothing in the past that can annul our right to each other; it is the
first time we have either of us loved with our whole heart and soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was still silent for a little while, looking down. Stephen was
in a flutter of new hope; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was going to triumph. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
eyes and met his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) with a glance that was filled with the anguish of
regret, not with yielding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not with my whole heart and soul, Stephen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said with timid
resolution. ``I have never consented to it with my whole mind. There
are memories, and affections, and longings after perfect goodness,
that have such a strong hold on me; they would never quit me for long;
they would come back and be pain to me--repentance. I couldn't live in
peace if I put the shadow of a wilful sin between myself and God. I
have caused sorrow already--I know--I feel it; but I have never
deliberately consented to it; I have never said, ``They shall suffer,
that I may have joy.<div class="bookquote">'' It has never been my will to marry you; if you
were to win consent from the momentary triumph of my feeling for you,
you would not have my whole soul. If I could wake back again into the
time before yesterday, I would choose to be true to my calmer
affections, and live without the joy of love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen loosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand, and rising impatiently, walked up and down
the room in suppressed rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) burst out at last, <div class="bookquote">``what a miserable thing a woman's
love is to a man's! I could commit crimes for you,--and you can
balance and choose in that way. But you _don't_ love me; if you had a
tithe of the feeling for me that I have for you, it would be
impossible to you to think for a moment of sacrificing me. But it
weighs nothing with you that you are robbing me of _my_ life's
happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fingers together almost convulsively as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held
them clasped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lap. A great terror was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were
ever and anon seeing where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood by great flashes of lightning,
and then again stretched forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands in the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't sacrifice you--I couldn't sacrifice you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could speak again; <div class="bookquote">``but I can't believe in a good for you,
that I feel, that we both feel, is a wrong toward others. We can't
choose happiness either for ourselves or for another; we can't tell
where that will lie. We can only choose whether we will indulge
ourselves in the present moment, or whether we will renounce that, for
the sake of obeying the divine voice within us,--for the sake of being
true to all the motives that sanctify our lives. I know this belief is
hard; it has slipped away from me again and again; but I have felt
that if I let it go forever, I should have no light through the
darkness of this life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, seating himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) again, <div class="bookquote">``is it
possible you don't see that what happened yesterday has altered the
whole position of things? What infatuation is it, what obstinate
prepossession, that blinds you to that? It is too late to say what we
might have done or what we ought to have done. Admitting the very
worst view of what has been done, it is a fact we must act on now; our
position is altered; the right course is no longer what it was before.
We must accept our own actions and start afresh from them. Suppose we
had been married yesterday? It is nearly the same thing. The effect on
others would not have been different. It would only have made this
difference to ourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>Stephen added bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``that you might have
acknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger than to others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Again a deep flush came over Maggie's face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was silent.
Stephen thought again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was beginning to prevail,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had never
yet believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) should _not_ prevail; there are possibilities
which our minds shrink from too completely for us to fear them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) deepest, tenderest tone, leaning toward
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), ``you _are_ mine now,--the world
believes it; duty must spring out of that now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a few hours you will be legally mine, and those who had claims on
us will submit,--they will see that there was a force which declared
against their claims.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was
close to hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) started up, pale again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, in a voice almost of agony; <div class="bookquote">``Stephen,
don't ask me--don't urge me. I can't argue any longer,--I don't know
what is wise; but my heart will not let me do it. I see,--I feel their
trouble now; it is as if it were branded on my mind. _I_ have
suffered, and had no one to pity me; and now I have made others
suffer. It would never leave me; it would embitter your love to me. I
_do_ care for Philip--in a different way; I remember all we said to
each other; I know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought of me as the one promise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was given to me that I might make his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lot less hard; and I
have forsaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). And Lucy--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has been deceived; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) who trusted me
more than any one. I cannot marry you; I cannot take a good for myself
that has been wrung out of their misery. It is not the force that
ought to rule us,--this that we feel for each other; it would rend me
away from all that my past life has made dear and holy to me. I can't
set out on a fresh life, and forget that; I must go back to it, and
cling to it, else I shall feel as if there were nothing firm beneath
my feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God, Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, rising too and grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm,
<div class="bookquote">``you rave. How can you go back without marrying me? You don't know
what will be said, dearest. You see nothing as it really is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. But they will believe me. I will confess everything. Lucy
will believe me--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) will forgive you, and--and--oh, _some_ good will
come by clinging to the right. Dear, dear Stephen, let me go!--don't
drag me into deeper remorse. My whole soul has never consented; it
does not consent now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen let go her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm, and sank back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chair, half-stunned by
despairing rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was silent a few moments, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>);
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes were turned toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) yearningly, in alarm at this
sudden change. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, still without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, then,--leave me; don't torture me any longer,--I can't bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Involuntarily she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leaned toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) shrank from it as if it had been burning iron, and said
again,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was not conscious of a decision as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned away from that
gloomy averted face, and walked out of the room; it was like an
automatic action that fulfils a forgotten intention. What came after?
A sense of stairs descended as if in a dream, of flagstones, of a
chaise and horses standing, then a street, and a turning into another
street where a stage-coach was standing, taking in passengers, and the
darting thought that that coach would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) away, perhaps toward
home. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could ask nothing yet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) only got into the coach.

<p/>Home--where her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother and brother were, Philip, Lucy, the scene of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very cares and trials--was the haven toward which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind tended;
the sanctuary where sacred relics lay, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would be rescued from
more falling. The thought of Stephen was like a horrible throbbing
pain, which yet, as such pains do, seemed to urge all other thoughts
into activity. But among her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thoughts, what others would say and think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) conduct was hardly present. Love and deep pity and remorseful
anguish left no room for that.

<p/>The coach was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to York, farther away from home; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did
not learn that until she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was set down in the old city at midnight. It
was no matter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could sleep there, and start home the next day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) purse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pocket, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) money in it,--a bank-note
and a sovereign; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had kept it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pocket from forgetfulness,
after going out to make purchases the day before yesterday.

<p/>Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) will bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice? The
great struggles of life are not so easy as that; the great problems of
life are not so clear. In the darkness of that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw Stephen's
face turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in passionate, reproachful misery; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lived
through again all the tremulous delights of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) presence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that
made existence an easy floating in a stream of joy, instead of a quiet
resolved endurance and effort. The love she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had renounced came back
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with a cruel charm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) felt herself opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arms to
receive it once more; and then it seemed to slip away and fade and
vanish, leaving only the dying sound of a deep, thrilling voice that
said, <div class="bookquote">``Gone, forever gone.''

<p/>_The Final Rescue_



<p/>Chapter I

<p/>The Return to the Mill


<p/>Between four and five o'clock on the afternoon of the fifth day from
that on which Stephen and Maggie had left St. Ogg's, Tom Tulliver was
standing on the gravel walk outside the old house at Dorlcote Mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
was master there now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had half fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) father's dying wish,
and by years of steady self-government and energetic work he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
brought himself near to the attainment of more than the old
respectability which had been the proud inheritance of the Dodsons and
Tullivers.

<p/>But Tom's face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood in the hot, still sunshine of that summer
afternoon, had no gladness, no triumph in it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth wore its
bitterest expression, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) severe brow its hardest and deepest fold, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drew down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat farther over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes to shelter them from the
sun, and thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands deep into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets, began to walk up
and down the gravel. No news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister had been heard since Bob
Jakin had come back in the steamer from Mudport, and put an end to all
improbable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>)
had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) land from a vessel with Mr. Stephen Guest. Would the next
news be that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was married,--or what? Probably that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was not
married; Tom's mind was set to the expectation of the worst that could
happen,--not death, but disgrace.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was walking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back toward the entrance gate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face
toward the rushing mill-stream, a tall, dark-eyed figure, that we know
well, approached the gate, and paused to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with a
fast-beating heart. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother was the human being of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
been most afraid from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) childhood upward; afraid with that fear
which springs in us when we love one who is inexorable, unbending,
unmodifiable, with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon, and
yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us.

<p/>That deep-rooted fear was shaking Maggie now; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind was
unswervingly bent on returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother, as the natural refuge
that had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). In her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deep humiliation under the retrospect
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own weakness,--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anguish at the injury she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
inflicted,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) almost desired to endure the severity of Tom's
reproof, to submit in patient silence to that harsh, disapproving
judgment against which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had so often rebelled; it seemed no more
than just to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now,--who was weaker than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) craved that
outward help to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) better purpose which would come from complete,
submissive confession; from being in the presence of those whose looks
and words would be a reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own conscience.

<p/>Maggie had been kept on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bed at York for a day with that
prostrating headache which was likely to follow on the terrible strain
of the previous day and night. There was an expression of physical
pain still about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brow and eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whole appearance, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
dress so long unchanged, was worn and distressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lifted the latch
of the gate and walked in slowly. Tom did not hear the gate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
just then close upon the roaring dam; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) presently turned, and
lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) worst conjectures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paused,
trembling and white with disgust and indignation.

<p/>Maggie paused too, three yards before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt the hatred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
face, felt it rushing through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fibres; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began faintly, <div class="bookquote">``I am come back to you,--I am come back
home--for refuge--to tell you everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find no home with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) answered, with tremulous rage.
<div class="bookquote">``You have disgraced us all. You have disgraced my father's name. You
have been a curse to your best friends. You have been base, deceitful;
no motives are strong enough to restrain you. I wash my hands of you
forever. You don't belong to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Their mother had come to the door now. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood paralyzed by the
double shock of seeing Maggie and hearing Tom's words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with more courage, <div class="bookquote">``I am perhaps not so guilty as
you believe me to be. I never meant to give way to my feelings. I
struggled against them. I was carried too far in the boat to come back
on Tuesday. I came back as soon as I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe in you any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, gradually passing from
the tremulous excitement of the first moment to cold inflexibility.
<div class="bookquote">``You have been carrying on a clandestine relation with Stephen
Guest,--as you did before with another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) went to see you at my aunt
Moss's; you walked alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) in the lanes; you must have behaved
as no modest girl would have done to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin's lover, else that
could never have happened. The people at Luckreth saw you pass; you
passed all the other places; you knew what you were doing. You have
been using Philip Wakem as a screen to deceive Lucy,--the kindest
friend you ever had. Go and see the return you have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s
ill; unable to speak. My mother can't go near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), lest she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should
remind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was half stunned,--too heavily pressed upon by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anguish even
to discern any difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) actual guilt and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother's
accusations, still less to vindicate herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, crushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands together under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cloak, in the
effort to speak again, <div class="bookquote">``whatever I have done, I repent it bitterly. I
want to make amends. I will endure anything. I want to be kept from
doing wrong again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What _will_ keep you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with cruel bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``Not
religion; not your natural feelings of gratitude and honor. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
would deserve to be shot, if it were not--But you are ten times
worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is. I loathe your character and your conduct. You
struggled with your feelings, you say. Yes! _I_ have had feelings to
struggle with; but I conquered them. I have had a harder life than you
have had; but I have found _my_ comfort in doing my duty. But I will
sanction no such character as yours; the world shall know that _I_
feel the difference between right and wrong. If you are in want, I
will provide for you; let my mother know. But you shall not come under
my roof. It is enough that I have to bear the thought of your
disgrace; the sight of you is hateful to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Slowly Maggie was turning away with despair in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart. But the poor
frightened mother's love leaped out now, stronger than all dread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child! I'll go with you. You've got a mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, the sweet rest of that embrace to the heart-stricken Maggie! More
helpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will
not forsake us.

<p/>Tom turned and walked into the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tulliver whispered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)'ll let you stay and
sleep in my bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) won't deny that if I ask him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a low tone, like a moan. <div class="bookquote">``I will never
go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then wait for me outside. I'll get ready and come with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother appeared with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonnet on, Tom came out to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in
the passage, and put money into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My house is yours, mother, always,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You will come and let
me know everything you want; you will come back to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mrs. Tulliver took the money, too frightened to say anything. The
only thing clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was the mother's instinct that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would go
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unhappy child.

<p/>Maggie was waiting outside the gate; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's hand and
they walked a little way in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, at last, <div class="bookquote">``we will go to Luke's cottage. Luke
will take me in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was very good to me when I was a little girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s got no room for us, my dear, now; his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) wife's got so many
children. I don't know where to go, if it isn't to one o' your aunts;
and I hardly durst,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs. Tulliver, quite destitute of
mental resources in this extremity.

<p/>Maggie was silent a little while, and then said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go to Bob Jakin's, mother; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) wife will have room for us, if
they have no other lodger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>So they went on their way to St. Ogg's, to the old house by the
river-side.

<p/>Bob himself was at home, with a heaviness at heart which resisted even
the new joy and pride of possessing a two-months'-old baby, quite the
liveliest of its age that had ever been born to prince or packman. He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
would perhaps not so thoroughly have understood all the dubiousness of
Maggie's appearance with Mr. Stephen Guest on the quay at Mudport if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) had not witnessed the effect it produced on Tom when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went to
report it; and since then, the circumstances which in any case gave a
disastrous character to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) elopement had passed beyond the more
polite circles of St. Ogg's, and had become matter of common talk,
accessible to the grooms and errand-boys. So that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) opened the
door and saw Maggie standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sorrow and weariness,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) had no questions to ask except one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) dared only ask
himself,--where was Mr. Stephen Guest? Bob, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) part, hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
might be in the warmest department of an asylum understood to exist in
the other world for gentlemen who are likely to be in fallen
circumstances there.

<p/>The lodgings were vacant, and both Mrs. Jakin the larger and Mrs.
Jakin the less were commanded to make all things comfortable for <div class="bookquote">``the
old Missis and the young Miss'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jakin</b></font>)</div>; alas that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) was still <div class="bookquote">``Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The
ingenious Bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have
come about; how Mr. Stephen Guest could have gone away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>), or
could have let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) go away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) had the chance of keeping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) was silent, and would not allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) wife to ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) a question; would not present himself in the room, lest it should
appear like intrusion and a wish to pry; having the same chivalry
toward dark-eyed Maggie as in the days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) had bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the
memorable present of books.

<p/>But after a day or two Mrs. Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a
few hours to see to Tom's household matters. Maggie had wished this;
after the first violent outburst of feeling which came as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had no longer any active purpose to fulfil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was less in need of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's presence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) even desired to be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) grief.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been solitary only a little while in the old sitting-room
that looked on the river, when there came a tap at the door, and
turning round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sad face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw Bob enter,
with the baby in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) arms and Mumps at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll go back, if it disturbs you, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, in a low voice, wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could smile.

<p/>Bob, closing the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), came and stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, we've got a little un, Miss, and I want'd you to look at it,
and take it in your arms, if you'd be so good. For we made free to
name it after you, and it `ud be better for your takin' a bit o'
notice on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie could not speak, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms to receive the tiny
baby, while Mumps snuffed at it anxiously, to ascertain that this
transference was all right. Maggie's heart had swelled at this action
and speech of Bob's; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew well enough that it was a way he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had
chosen to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sympathy and respect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said presently, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sat down in silence,
finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) tongue unmanageable in quite a new fashion, refusing to
say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wanted it to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, after a few moments, looking down at the baby, and
holding it anxiously, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feared it might slip from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``I have a favor to ask of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you speak so, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, grasping the skin of Mumps's
neck; <div class="bookquote">``if there's anything I can do for you, I should look upon it as
a day's earnings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to go to Dr. Kenn's, and ask to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
that I am here, and should be very grateful if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) would come to me
while my mother is away. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will not come back till evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Miss, I'd do it in a minute,--it is but a step,--but Dr. Kenn's
wife lies dead; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s to be buried to-morrow; died the day I come from
Mudport. It's all the more pity she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should ha' died just now, if you
want him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>). I hardly like to go a-nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``we must let it be,--till after a few days,
perhaps, when you hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is going about again. But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
may be going out of town--to a distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, with a new sense
of despondency at this idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob. <div class="bookquote">''_He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll_ none go away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) isn't one o' them
gentlefolks as go to cry at waterin'-places when their wives die; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s
got summat else to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) looks fine and sharp after the parish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
does. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) christened the little un; an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was _at_ me to know what I
did of a Sunday, as I didn't come to church. But I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) I was upo'
the travel three parts o' the Sundays,--an' then I'm so used to bein'
on my legs, I can't sit so long on end,--`an' lors, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>says I, 'a
packman can do wi' a small `lowance o' church; it tastes strong,<div class="bookquote">'' says
I; `there's no call to lay it on thick.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Eh, Miss, how good the little
un is wi' you! It's like as if it knowed you; it partly does, I'll be
bound,--like the birds know the mornin'.''

<p/>Bob's tongue was now evidently loosed from its unwonted bondage, and
might even be in danger of doing more work than was required of it.
But the subjects on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) longed to be informed were so steep and
difficult of approach, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) tongue was likely to run on along the
level rather than to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) on that unbeaten road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) felt this,
and was silent again for a little while, ruminating much on the
possible forms in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) might put a question. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) said, in a
more timid voice than usual,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you give me leave to ask you only one thing, Miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie was rather startled, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Bob, if it is
about myself--not about any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss, it's this. _Do_ you owe anybody a grudge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) inquiringly. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, lors, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, pinching Mumps's neck harder than ever. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish you did, an' tell me; I'd leather him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) till I couldn't see--I
would--an' the Justice might do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) liked to me arter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, smiling faintly, <div class="bookquote">``you're a very good friend to
me. But I shouldn't like to punish any one, even if they'd done me
wrong; I've done wrong myself too often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>This view of things was puzzling to Bob, and threw more obscurity than
ever over what could possibly have happened between Stephen and
Maggie. But further questions would have been too intrusive, even if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could have framed them suitably, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was obliged to carry baby
away again to an expectant mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happen you'd like Mumps for company, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had taken
the baby again. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s rare company, Mumps is; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) knows iverything, an'
makes no bother about it. If I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll lie before you an'
watch you, as still,--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) watches my pack. You'd better let me
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) a bit; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll get fond on you. Lors, it's a fine thing to hev
a dumb brute fond on you; it'll stick to you, an' make no jaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, do leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``I think I should like to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mumps, lie down there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, pointing to a place in front of
Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``and niver do you stir till you're spoke to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mumps lay down at once, and made no sign of restlessness when his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
master left the room.



<p/>Chapter II

<p/>St. Ogg's Passes Judgment


<p/>It was soon known throughout St. Ogg's that Miss Tulliver was come
back; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had not, then, eloped in order to be married to Mr. Stephen
Guest,--at all events, Mr. Stephen Guest had not married her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>); which
came to the same thing, so far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) culpability was concerned. We
judge others according to results; how else?--not knowing the process
by which results are arrived at. If Miss Tulliver, after a few months
of well-chosen travel, had returned as Mrs. Stephen Guest, with a
post-marital _trousseau_, and all the advantages possessed even by the
most unwelcome wife of an only son, public opinion, which at St.
Ogg's, as else where, always knew what to think, would have judged in
strict consistency with those results. Public opinion, in these cases,
is always of the feminine gender,--not the world, but the world's
wife; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have seen that two handsome young people--the
gentleman of quite the first family in St. Ogg's--having found
themselves in a false position, had been led into a course which, to
say the least of it, was highly injudicious, and productive of sad
pain and disappointment, especially to that sweet young thing, Miss
Deane. Mr. Stephen Guest had certainly not behaved well; but then,
young men were liable to those sudden infatuated attachments; and bad
as it might seem in Mrs. Stephen Guest to admit the faintest advances
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) cousin's lover -LRB-indeed it _had_ been said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) was
actually engaged to young Wakem,--old Wakem himself had mentioned it-RRB-,
still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) was very young,--<div class="bookquote">``and a deformed young man, you know!--and
young Guest so very fascinating; and, they say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) positively worships
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) -LRB-to be sure, that can't last!-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) ran away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) in the
boat quite against her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) will, and what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) couldn't come
back then; no one would have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>); and how very well that
maize-colored satinette becomes her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) complexion! It seems as if the
folds in front were quite come in; several of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) dresses are made
so,--they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) thinks nothing too handsome to buy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). Poor Miss
Deane! She (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) is very pitiable; but then there was no positive
engagement; and the air at the coast will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) good. After all, if
young Guest felt no more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) than _that_ it was better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) not
to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>). What a wonderful marriage for a girl like Miss
Tulliver,--quite romantic? Why, young Guest will put up for the
borough at the next election. Nothing like commerce nowadays! That
young Wakem nearly went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) always _was_ rather queer;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)'s gone abroad again to be out of the way,--quite the best thing
for a deformed young man. Miss Unit declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) will never visit Mr.
and Mrs. Stephen Guest,--such nonsense! pretending to be better than
other people. Society couldn't be carried on if we inquired into
private conduct in that way,--and Christianity tells us to think no
evil,--and my belief is, that Miss Unit had no cards sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But the results, we know, were not of a kind to warrant this
extenuation of the past. Maggie had returned without a _trousseau_,
without a husband,--in that degraded and outcast condition to which
error is well known to lead; and the world's wife, with that fine
instinct which is given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for the preservation of Society, saw at
once that Miss Tulliver's conduct had been of the most aggravated
kind. Could anything be more detestable? A girl so much indebted to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends--whose mother as well as herself had received so much
kindness from the Deanes--to lay the design of winning a young man's
affections away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own cousin, who had behaved like a sister to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! Winning his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) affections? That was not the phrase for such a girl
as Miss Tulliver; it would have been more correct to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had
been actuated by mere unwomanly boldness and unbridled passion. There
was always something questionable about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). That connection with
young Wakem, which, they said, had been carried on for years, looked
very ill,--disgusting, in fact! But with a girl of that disposition!
To the world's wife there had always been something in Miss Tulliver's
very _physique_ that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm.
As for poor Mr. Stephen Guest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) was rather pitiable than otherwise;
a young man of five-and-twenty is not to be too severely judged in
these cases,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is really very much at the mercy of a designing, bold
girl. And it was clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given way in spite of himself: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had shaken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could; indeed, their having parted so
soon looked very black indeed--_for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_. To be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had written a
letter, laying all the blame on himself, and telling the story in a
romantic fashion so as to try and make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appear quite innocent; of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do that! But the refined instinct of the world's wife
was not to be deceived; providentially!--else what would become of
Society? Why, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own brother had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) door; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had
seen enough, you might be sure, before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would do that. A truly
respectable young man, Mr. Tom Tulliver; quite likely to rise in the
world! His (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister's disgrace was naturally a heavy blow to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). It was
to be hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would go out of the neighborhood,--to America, or
anywhere,--so as to purify the air of St. Ogg's from the stain of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
presence, extremely dangerous to daughters there! No good could happen
to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); it was only to be hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would repent, and that God would
have mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>): He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not the care of society on His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, as the
world's wife had.

<p/>It required nearly a fortnight for fine instinct to assure itself of
these inspirations; indeed, it was a whole week before Stephen's
letter came, telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) father the facts, and adding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was gone
across to Holland,--had drawn upon the agent at Mudport for
money,--was incapable of any resolution at present.

<p/>Maggie, all this while, was too entirely filled with a more agonizing
anxiety to spend any thought on the view that was being taken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
conduct by the world of St. Ogg's; anxiety about Stephen, Lucy,
Philip, beat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) poor heart in a hard, driving, ceaseless storm of
mingled love, remorse, and pity. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had thought of rejection and
injustice at all, it would have seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that they had done their
worst; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could hardly feel any stroke from them intolerable
since the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother's lips. Across all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
anxiety for the loved and the injured, those words shot again and
again, like a horrible pang that would have brought misery and dread
even into a heaven of delights. The idea of ever recovering happiness
never glimmered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind for a moment; it seemed as if every
sensitive fibre in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) were too entirely preoccupied by pain ever to
vibrate again to another influence. Life stretched before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as one
act of penitence; and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) craved, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dwelt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) future lot,
was something to guarantee her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) from more falling; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own weakness
haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) like a vision of hideous possibilities, that made no peace
conceivable except such as lay in the sense of a sure refuge.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was not without practical intentions; the love of independence
was too strong an inheritance and a habit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) not to remember that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must get her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bread; and when other projects looked vague, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fell
back on that of returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) plain sewing, and so getting enough
to pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lodging at Bob's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) meant to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother to
return to the Mill by and by, and live with Tom again; and somehow or
other she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would maintain herself at St. Ogg's. Dr. Kenn would perhaps
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) parting words at the
bazaar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remembered the momentary feeling of reliance that had
sprung in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) was talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) waited with
yearning expectation for the opportunity of confiding everything to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother called every day at Mr. Deane's to learn how Lucy was;
the report was always sad,--nothing had yet roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) from the feeble
passivity which had come on with the first shock. But of Philip, Mrs.
Tulliver had learned nothing; naturally, no one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) met would
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) about what related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) daughter. But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
summoned courage to go and see sister Glegg, who of course would know
everything, and had been even to see Tom at the Mill in Mrs.
Tulliver's absence, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had said nothing of what had passed on
the occasion.

<p/>As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) mother was gone, Maggie put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bonnet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
resolved on walking to the Rectory and asking to see Dr. Kenn; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) was
in deep grief, but the grief of another does not jar upon us in such
circumstances. It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been beyond the door
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) return; nevertheless her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind was so bent on the purpose of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walk, that the unpleasantness of meeting people on the way, and
being stared at, did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no sooner passed
beyond the narrower streets which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to thread from Bob's
dwelling, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) became aware of unusual glances cast at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and
this consciousness made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hurry along nervously, afraid to look to
right or left. Presently, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) came full on Mrs. and Miss
Turnbull, old acquaintances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>) family; they both looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Turnbull</b></font>)
strangely, and turned a little aside without speaking. All hard looks
were pain to Maggie, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) self-reproach was too strong for
resentment. No wonder they will not speak to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought; they are
very fond of Lucy. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was about to pass a group
of gentlemen, who were standing at the door of the billiard-rooms, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not help seeing young Torry step out a little with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) glass
at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) eye, and bow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Torry</b></font>) with that air of _nonchalance_ which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>)
might have bestowed on a friendly barmaid.

<p/>Maggie's pride was too intense for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) not to feel that sting, even in
the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sorrow; and for the first time the thought took
strong hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have other obloquy cast on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
besides that which was felt to be due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breach of faith toward
Lucy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was at the Rectory now; there, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would find
something else than retribution. Retribution may come from any voice;
the hardest, cruelest, most imbruted urchin at the street-corner can
inflict it; surely help and pity are rarer things, more needful for
the righteous to bestow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was shown up at once, after being announced, into Dr. Kenn's
study, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) sat amongst piled-up books, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) had little
appetite, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) cheek against the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) youngest child, a
girl of three. The child was sent away with the servant, and when the
door was closed, Dr. Kenn said, placing a chair for Maggie,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was coming to see you, Miss Tulliver; you have anticipated me; I am
glad you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) childlike directness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done at
the bazaar, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes
filled fast with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said it, and all the pent-up excitement
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) humiliating walk would have its vent before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could say more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do tell me everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div>Dr. Kenn said, with quiet kindness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
grave, firm voice. <div class="bookquote">``Think of me as one to whom a long experience has
been granted, which may enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>In rather broken sentences, and with some effort at first, but soon
with the greater ease that came from a sense of relief in the
confidence, Maggie told the brief story of a struggle that must be the
beginning of a long sorrow. Only the day before, Dr. Kenn had been
made acquainted with the contents of Stephen's letter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) had
believed them at once, without the confirmation of Maggie's statement.
That involuntary plaint of hers, <div class="bookquote">''_Oh, I must go_,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>had remained with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) as the sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was undergoing some inward conflict.

<p/>Maggie dwelt the longest on the feeling which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) come back
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother and brother, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cling to all the memories of
the past. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ended, Dr. Kenn was silent for some minutes;
there was a difficulty on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) rose, and walked up and down
the hearth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>). At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) seated himself again,
and said, looking at Maggie,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your prompting to go to your nearest friends,--to remain where all
the ties of your life have been formed,--is a true prompting, to which
the Church in its original constitution and discipline responds,
opening its arms to the penitent, watching over its children to the
last; never abandoning them until they are hopelessly reprobate. And
the Church ought to represent the feeling of the community, so that
every parish should be a family knit together by Christian brotherhood
under a spiritual father. But the ideas of discipline and Christian
fraternity are entirely relaxed,--they can hardly be said to exist in
the public mind; they hardly survive except in the partial,
contradictory form they have taken in the narrow communities of
schismatics; and if I were not supported by the firm faith that the
Church must ultimately recover the full force of that constitution
which is alone fitted to human needs, I should often lose heart at
observing the want of fellowship and sense of mutual responsibility
among my own flock. At present everything seems tending toward the
relaxation of ties,--toward the substitution of wayward choice for the
adherence to obligation, which has its roots in the past. Your
conscience and your heart have given you true light on this point,
Miss Tulliver; and I have said all this that you may know what my wish
about you--what my advice to you--would be, if they sprang from my own
feeling and opinion unmodified by counteracting circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Kenn paused a little while. There was an entire absence of
effusive benevolence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) manner; there was something almost cold in
the gravity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) look and voice. If Maggie had not known that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
benevolence was persevering in proportion to its reserve, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might
have been chilled and frightened. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) listened expectantly,
quite sure that there would be some effective help in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your inexperience of the world, Miss Tulliver, prevents you from
anticipating fully the very unjust conceptions that will probably be
formed concerning your conduct,--conceptions which will have a baneful
effect, even in spite of known evidence to disprove them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do,--I begin to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, unable to repress this
utterance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) recent pain. <div class="bookquote">``I know I shall be insulted. I shall be
thought worse than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You perhaps do not yet know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Kenn, with a touch of more
personal pity, <div class="bookquote">``that a letter is come which ought to satisfy every one
who has known anything of you, that you chose the steep and difficult
path of a return to the right, at the moment when that return was most
of all difficult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said poor Maggie, with a flush and tremor that no
presence could have hindered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is gone abroad; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has written of all that passed to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has vindicated you to the utmost; and I hope the communication of
that letter to your cousin will have a beneficial effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Kenn waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to get calm again before he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That letter, as I said, ought to suffice to prevent false impressions
concerning you. But I am bound to tell you, Miss Tulliver, that not
only the experience of my whole life, but my observation within the
last three days, makes me fear that there is hardly any evidence which
will save you from the painful effect of false imputations. The
persons who are the most incapable of a conscientious struggle such as
yours are precisely those who will be likely to shrink from you,
because they will not believe in your struggle. I fear your life here
will be attended not only with much pain, but with many obstructions.
For this reason--and for this only--I ask you to consider whether it
will not perhaps be better for you to take a situation at a distance,
according to your former intention. I will exert myself at once to
obtain one for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if I could but stop here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``I have no heart to begin
a strange life again. I should have no stay. I should feel like a
lonely wanderer, cut off from the past. I have written to the lady who
offered me a situation to excuse myself. If I remained here, I could
perhaps atone in some way to Lucy--to others; I could convince them
that I'm sorry. And,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, with some of the old proud fire
flashing out, <div class="bookquote">``I will not go away because people say false things of
me. They shall learn to retract them. If I must go away at last,
because--because others wish it, I will not go now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Kenn, after some consideration, <div class="bookquote">``if you determine on
that, Miss Tulliver, you may rely on all the influence my position
gives me. I am bound to aid and countenance you by the very duties of
my office as a parish priest. I will add, that personally I have a
deep interest in your peace of mind and welfare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The only thing I want is some occupation that will enable me to get
my bread and be independent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not want much. I
can go on lodging where I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must think over the subject maturely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Kenn, <div class="bookquote">``and in a few
days I shall be better able to ascertain the general feeling. I shall
come to see you; I shall bear you constantly in mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Kenn/Kenn</b></font>)</div><p/>When Maggie had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>), Dr. Kenn stood ruminating with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) hands
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) eyes fixed on the carpet, under a painful sense of
doubt and difficulty. The tone of Stephen's letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had read,
and the actual relations of all the persons concerned, forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
powerfully the idea of an ultimate marriage between Stephen and Maggie
as the least evil; and the impossibility of their proximity in St.
Ogg's on any other supposition, until after years of separation, threw
an insurmountable prospective difficulty over Maggie's stay there. On
the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) entered with all the comprehension of a man who had
known spiritual conflict, and lived through years of devoted service
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) fellow-men, into that state of Maggie's heart and conscience
which made the consent to the marriage a desecration to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
conscience must not be tampered with; the principle on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
acted was a safer guide than any balancing of consequences. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>)
experience told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) that intervention was too dubious a responsibility
to be lightly incurred; the possible issue either of an endeavor to
restore the former relations with Lucy and Philip, or of counselling
submission to this irruption of a new feeling, was hidden in a
darkness all the more impenetrable because each immediate step was
clogged with evil.

<p/>The great problem of the shifting relation between passion and duty is
clear to no man who is capable of apprehending it; the question
whether the moment has come in which a man has fallen below the
possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy, and must
accept the sway of a passion against which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had struggled as a
trespass, is one for which we have no master-key that will fit all
cases. The casuists have become a byword of reproach; but their
perverted spirit of minute discrimination was the shadow of a truth to
which eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealed,--the truth, that
moral judgments must remain false and hollow, unless they are checked
and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances
that mark the individual lot.

<p/>All people of broad, strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to
the men of maxims; because such people early discern that the
mysterious complexity of our life is not to be embraced by maxims, and
that to lace ourselves up in formulas of that sort is to repress all
the divine promptings and inspirations that spring from growing
insight and sympathy. And the man of maxims is the popular
representative of the minds that are guided in their moral judgment
solely by general rules, thinking that these will lead them to justice
by a ready-made patent method, without the trouble of exerting
patience, discrimination, impartiality,--without any care to assure
themselves whether they have the insight that comes from a hardly
earned estimate of temptation, or from a life vivid and intense enough
to have created a wide fellow-feeling with all that is human.



<p/>Chapter III

<p/>Showing That Old Acquaintances Are Capable of Surprising Us


<p/>When Maggie was at home again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) news of an
unexpected line of conduct in aunt Glegg. As long as Maggie had not
been heard of, Mrs. Glegg had half closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) shutters and drawn down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) blinds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) felt assured that Maggie was drowned; that was far
more probable than that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) niece and legatee should have done
anything to wound the family honor in the tenderest point. When at
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) learned from Tom that Maggie had come home, and gathered from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) explanation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) burst forth in severe
reproof of Tom for admitting the worst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister until he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
compelled. If you were not to stand by your <div class="bookquote">``kin''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as long as there was
a shred of honor attributable to them, pray what were you to stand by?
Lightly to admit conduct in one of your own family that would force
you to alter your will, had never been the way of the Dodsons; and
though Mrs. Glegg had always augured ill of Maggie's future at a time
when other people were perhaps less clear-sighted, yet fair play was a
jewel, and it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own friends to help to rob the girl of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fair fame, and to cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) out from family shelter to the scorn of
the outer world, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had become unequivocally a family disgrace.
The circumstances were unprecedented in Mrs. Glegg's experience;
nothing of that kind had happened among the Dodsons before; but it was
a case in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) hereditary rectitude and personal strength of
character found a common channel along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) fundamental ideas of
clanship, as they did in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) lifelong regard to equity in money
matters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) quarrelled with Mr. Glegg, whose kindness, flowing
entirely into compassion for Lucy, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) as hard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) judgment of
Maggie as Mr. Deane himself was; and fuming against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sister
Tulliver because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not at once come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for advice and help,
shut herself up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own room with Baxter's <div class="bookquote">``Saints' Rest''  (<font color='red'><b>Baxter</b></font>)</div>from
morning till night, denying herself to all visitors, till Mr. Glegg
brought from Mr. Deane the news of Stephen's letter. Then Mrs. Glegg
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had adequate fighting-ground; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) laid aside
Baxter, and was ready to meet all comers. While Mrs. Pullet could do
nothing but shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Pullet</b></font>) head and cry, and wish that cousin Abbot had
died, or any number of funerals had happened rather than this, which
had never happened before, so that there was no knowing how to act,
and Mrs. Pullet could never enter St. Ogg's again, because
<div class="bookquote">``acquaintances''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Ogg/Ogg</b></font>)</div>knew of it all, Mrs. Glegg only hoped that Mrs. Wooll,
or any one else, would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) with their false tales about her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
own niece, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) would know what to say to that ill-advised person!

<p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) had a scene of remonstrance with Tom, all the more severe in
proportion to the greater strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) present position. But Tom,
like other immovable things, seemed only the more rigidly fixed under
that attempt to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Poor Tom! he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) judged by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been
able to see; and the judgment was painful enough to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had the demonstration of facts observed through years by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own eyes, which gave no warning of their imperfection, that
Maggie's nature was utterly untrustworthy, and too strongly marked
with evil tendencies to be safely treated with leniency. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would act
on that demonstration at any cost; but the thought of it made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) days
bitter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Tom, like every one of us, was imprisoned within the
limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own nature, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) education had simply glided over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), leaving a slight deposit of polish; if you are inclined to be
severe on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) severity, remember that the responsibility of tolerance
lies with those who have the wider vision. There had arisen in Tom a
repulsion toward Maggie that derived its very intensity from their
early childish love in the time when they had clasped tiny fingers
together, and their later sense of nearness in a common duty and a
common sorrow; the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), was hateful to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). In this branch of the Dodson family aunt Glegg found a stronger
nature than her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) own; a nature in which family feeling had lost the
character of clanship by taking on a doubly deep dye of personal
pride.

<p/>Mrs. Glegg allowed that Maggie ought to be punished,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not a
woman to deny that; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew what conduct was,--but punished in
proportion to the misdeeds proved against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), not to those which were
cast upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by people outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own family who might wish to show
that their own kin were better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your aunt Glegg scolded me so as niver was, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs.
Tulliver, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) came back to Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``as I didn't go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) before;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said it wasn't for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) to come to me first. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) spoke like a
sister, too; _having_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) allays was, and hard to please,--oh
dear!--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'s said the kindest word as has ever been spoke by you
yet, my child. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) says, for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'s been so set again' having
one extry in the house, and making extry spoons and things, and
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) about in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) ways, you shall have a shelter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) house,
if you'll go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) dutiful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)'ll uphold you against folks as
say harm of you when they've no call. And I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) I thought you
couldn't bear to see anybody but me, you were so beat down with
trouble; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) said, '_I_ won't throw ill words at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>); there's them
out o' th' family `ull be ready enough to do that. But I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>)
good advice; an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) must be humble.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>It's wonderful o' Jane; for I'm
sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) used to throw everything I did wrong at me,--if it was the
raisin-wine as turned out bad, or the pies too hot, or whativer it
was.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said poor Maggie, shrinking from the thought of all the
contact her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bruised mind would have to bear, <div class="bookquote">``tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I'm very
grateful; I'll go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as soon as I can; but I can't see any one
just yet, except Dr. Kenn. I've been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) will advise me, and
help me to get some occupation. I can't live with any one, or be
dependent on them, tell aunt Glegg; I must get my own bread. But did
you hear nothing of Philip--Philip Wakem? Have you never seen any one
that has mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; but I've been to Lucy's, and I saw your uncle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
says they got her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to listen to the letter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took notice o' Miss
Guest, and asked questions, and the doctor thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>)'s on the turn to
be better. What a world this is,--what trouble, oh dear! The law was
the first beginning, and it's gone from bad to worse, all of a sudden,
just when the luck seemed on the turn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>This was the first lamentation
that Mrs. Tulliver had let slip to Maggie, but old habit had been
revived by the interview with sister Glegg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor, poor mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie burst out, cut to the heart with pity
and compunction, and throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's neck; <div class="bookquote">``I was
always naughty and troublesome to you. And now you might have been
happy if it hadn't been for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tulliver, leaning toward the warm young
cheek; <div class="bookquote">``I must put up wi' my children,--I shall never have no more;
and if they bring me bad luck, I must be fond on it. There's nothing
else much to be fond on, for my furnitur' went long ago. And you'd got
to be very good once; I can't think how it's turned out the wrong way
so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>Still two or three more days passed, and Maggie heard nothing of
Philip; anxiety about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) predominant trouble, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) summoned courage at last to inquire about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of Dr. Kenn, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
next visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) did not even know if Philip was at home. The
elder Wakem was made moody by an accumulation of annoyance; the
disappointment in this young Jetsome, to whom, apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) was a
good deal attached, had been followed close by the catastrophe to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>)
son's hopes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) had done violence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) own strong feeling by
conceding to them, and had incautiously mentioned this concession in
St. Ogg's; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) was almost fierce in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) brusqueness when any one
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) a question about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) son.

<p/>But Philip could hardly have been ill, or it would have been known
through the calling in of the medical man; it was probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
gone out of the town for a little while. Maggie sickened under this
suspense, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination began to live more and more persistently
in what Philip was enduring. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) believe about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)?

<p/>At last Bob brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a letter, without a postmark, directed in a
hand which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew familiarly in the letters of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own name,--a hand
in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) name had been written long ago, in a pocket Shakespeare
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) possessed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother was in the room, and Maggie, in
violent agitation, hurried upstairs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might read the letter in
solitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) read it with a throbbing brow.

<p/>``Maggie,--I believe in you; I know you never meant to deceive me; I
know you tried to keep faith to me and to all. I believed this
before I had any other evidence of it than your own nature. The
night after I last parted from you I suffered torments. I had seen
what convinced me that you were not free; that there was another
whose presence had a power over you which mine never possessed; but
through all the suggestions--almost murderous suggestions--of rage
and jealousy, my mind made its way to believe in your truthfulness.
I was sure that you meant to cleave to me, as you had said; that
you had rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); that you struggled to renounce him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), for
Lucy's sake and for mine. But I could see no issue that was not
fatal for _you;_ and that dread shut out the very thought of
resignation. I foresaw that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not relinquish you, and I
believed then, as I believe now, that the strong attraction which
drew you together proceeded only from one side of your characters,
and belonged to that partial, divided action of our nature which
makes half the tragedy of the human lot. I have felt the vibration
of chords in your nature that I have continually felt the want of
in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). But perhaps I am wrong; perhaps I feel about you as the
artist does about the scene over which his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) soul has brooded with
love; he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) would tremble to see it confided to other hands; he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) would
never believe that it could bear for another all the meaning and
the beauty it bears for him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>).

<p/>``I dared not trust myself to see you that morning; I was filled
with selfish passion; I was shattered by a night of conscious
delirium. I told you long ago that I had never been resigned even
to the mediocrity of my powers; how could I be resigned to the loss
of the one thing which had ever come to me on earth with the
promise of such deep joy as would give a new and blessed meaning to
the foregoing pain,--the promise of another self that would lift my
aching affection into the divine rapture of an ever-springing,
ever-satisfied want?

<p/>``But the miseries of that night had prepared me for what came
before the next. It was no surprise to me. I was certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
had prevailed on you to sacrifice everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and I waited
with equal certainty to hear of your marriage. I measured your love
and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) by my own. But I was wrong, Maggie. There is something
stronger in you than your love for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).

<p/>``I will not tell you what I went through in that interval. But even
in its utmost agony--even in those terrible throes that love must
suffer before it can be disembodied of selfish desire--my love for
you sufficed to withhold me from suicide, without the aid of any
other motive. In the midst of my egoism, I yet could not bear to
come like a death-shadow across the feast of your joy. I could not
bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and might need
me; it was part of the faith I had vowed to you,--to wait and
endure. Maggie, that is a proof of what I write now to assure you
of,--that no anguish I have had to bear on your account has been
too heavy a price to pay for the new life into which I have entered
in loving you. I want you to put aside all grief because of the
grief you have caused me. I was nurtured in the sense of privation;
I never expected happiness; and in knowing you, in loving you, I
have had, and still have, what reconciles me to life. You have been
to my affections what light, what color is to my eyes, what music
is to the inward ear, you have raised a dim unrest into a vivid
consciousness. The new life I have found in caring for your joy and
sorrow more than for what is directly my own, has transformed the
spirit of rebellious murmuring into that willing endurance which is
the birth of strong sympathy. I think nothing but such complete and
intense love could have initiated me into that enlarged life which
grows and grows by appropriating the life of others; for before, I
was always dragged back from it by ever-present painful
self-consciousness. I even think sometimes that this gift of
transferred life which has come to me in loving you, may be a new
power to me.

<p/>``Then, dear one, in spite of all, you have been the blessing of my
life. Let no self-reproach weigh on you because of me. It is I who
should rather reproach myself for having urged my feelings upon
you, and hurried you into words that you have felt as fetters. You
meant to be true to those words; you _have_ been true. I can
measure your sacrifice by what I have known in only one half-hour
of your presence with me, when I dreamed that you might love me
best. But, Maggie, I have no just claim on you for more than
affectionate remembrance.

<p/>``For some time I have shrunk from writing to you, because I have
shrunk even from the appearance of wishing to thrust myself before
you, and so repeating my original error. But you will not
misconstrue me. I know that we must keep apart for a long while;
cruel tongues would force us apart, if nothing else did. But I
shall not go away. The place where you are is the one where my mind
must live, wherever I might travel. And remember that I am
unchangeably yours,--yours not with selfish wishes, but with a
devotion that excludes such wishes.

<p/>``God comfort you, my loving, large-souled Maggie. If every one else
has misconceived you, remember that you have never been doubted by
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whose heart recognized you ten years ago.

<p/>``Do not believe any one who says I am ill, because I am not seen
out of doors. I have only had nervous headaches,--no worse than I
have sometimes had them before. But the overpowering heat inclines
me to be perfectly quiescent in the daytime. I am strong enough to
obey any word which shall tell me that I can serve you by word or
deed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours to the last,
'' (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Wakem/Philip Wakem</b></font>)</div>_Philip Wakem_.''

<p/>As Maggie knelt by the bed sobbing, with that letter pressed under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feelings again and again gathered themselves in a whispered
cry, always in the same words,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O God, is there any happiness in love that could make me forget
_their_ pain?''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter IV

<p/>Maggie and Lucy


<p/>By the end of the week Dr. Kenn had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) mind that there was
only one way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) could secure to Maggie a suitable living at
St. Ogg's. Even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) twenty years' experience as a parish priest,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) was aghast at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
in the face of evidence. Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) had been rather more adored and
appealed to than was quite agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>); but now, in attempting to
open the ears of women to reason, and their consciences to justice, on
behalf of Maggie Tulliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) suddenly found himself as powerless as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) was aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) would have been if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) had attempted to influence the
shape of bonnets. Dr. Kenn could not be contradicted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) was listened
to in silence; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) left the room, a comparison of opinions
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) hearers yielded much the same result as before. Miss
Tulliver had undeniably acted in a blamable manner, even Dr. Kenn did
not deny that; how, then, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) think so lightly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) as to put
that favorable interpretation on everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) had done? Even on the
supposition that required the utmost stretch of belief,--namely, that
none of the things said about Miss Tulliver were true,--still, since
they _had_ been said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), they had cast an odor round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) which
must cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to be shrunk from by every woman who had to take care
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) own reputation--and of Society. To have taken Maggie by the
hand and said, <div class="bookquote">``I will not believe unproved evil of you; my lips shall
not utter it; my ears shall be closed against it; I, too, am an erring
mortal, liable to stumble, apt to come short of my most earnest
efforts; your lot has been harder than mine, your temptation greater;
let us help each other to stand and walk without more falling,'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>--to
have done this would have demanded courage, deep pity, self-knowledge,
generous trust; would have demanded a mind that tasted no piquancy in
evil-speaking, that felt no self-exaltation in condemning, that
cheated itself with no large words into the belief that life can have
any moral end, any high religion, which excludes the striving after
perfect truth, justice, and love toward the individual men and women
who come across our own path. The ladies of St. Ogg's were not
beguiled by any wide speculative conceptions; but they had their
favorite abstraction, called Society, which served to make their
consciences perfectly easy in doing what satisfied their own
egoism,--thinking and speaking the worst of Maggie Tulliver, and
turning their backs upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). It was naturally disappointing to Dr.
Kenn, after two years of superfluous incense from his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) feminine
parishioners, to find them suddenly maintaining their views in
opposition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>); but then they maintained them in opposition to a
higher Authority, which they had venerated longer. That Authority had
furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire where
their social duties began, and might be inclined to take wide views as
to the starting-point. The answer had not turned on the ultimate good
of Society, but on <div class="bookquote">``a certain man''  (<font color='red'><b>Society</b></font>)</div>who was found in trouble by the
wayside.

<p/>Not that St. Ogg's was empty of women with some tenderness of heart
and conscience; probably it had as fair a proportion of human goodness
in it as any other small trading town of that day. But until every
good man is brave, we must expect to find many good women timid,--too
timid even to believe in the correctness of their own best promptings,
when these would place them in a minority. And the men at St. Ogg's
were not all brave, by any means; some of them were even fond of
scandal, and to an extent that might have given their conversation an
effeminate character, if it had not been distinguished by masculine
jokes, and by an occasional shrug of the shoulders at the mutual
hatred of women. It was the general feeling of the masculine mind at
St. Ogg's that women were not to be interfered with in their treatment
of each other.

<p/>And thus every direction in which Dr. Kenn had turned, in the hope of
procuring some kind recognition and some employment for Maggie, proved
a disappointment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>). Mrs. James Torry could not think of taking
Maggie as a nursery governess, even temporarily,--a young woman about
whom <div class="bookquote">``such things had been said,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>and about whom <div class="bookquote">``gentlemen joked'' (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>;
and Miss Kirke, who had a spinal complaint, and wanted a reader and
companion, felt quite sure that Maggie's mind must be of a quality
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part, could not risk _any_ contact. Why did
not Miss Tulliver accept the shelter offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) aunt Glegg? It
did not become a girl like her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) to refuse it. Or else, why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) not
go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was not
known? -LRB-It was not, apparently, of so much importance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) should
carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) dangerous tendencies into strange families unknown at St.
Ogg's.-RRB- She (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) must be very bold and hardened to wish to stay in a parish
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was so much stared at and whispered about.

<p/>Dr. Kenn, having great natural firmness, began, in the presence of
this opposition, as every firm man would have done, to contract a
certain strength of determination over and above what would have been
called forth by the end in view. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself wanted a daily governess
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) younger children; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hesitated in the first
instance to offer this position to Maggie, the resolution to protest
with the utmost force of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal and priestly character against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) being crushed and driven away by slander, was now decisive. Maggie
gratefully accepted an employment that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) duties as well as a
support; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) days would be filled now, and solitary evenings would be
a welcome rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) no longer needed the sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother made in
staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and Mrs. Tulliver was persuaded to go back to the
Mill.

<p/>But now it began to be discovered that Dr. Kenn, exemplary as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) had
hitherto appeared, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) crotchets, possibly his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) weaknesses. The
masculine mind of St. Ogg's smiled pleasantly, and did not wonder that
Kenn liked to see a fine pair of eyes daily, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) was inclined
to take so lenient a view of the past; the feminine mind, regarded at
that period as less powerful, took a more melancholy view of the case.
If Dr. Kenn should be beguiled into marrying that Miss Tulliver! It
was not safe to be too confident, even about the best of men; an
apostle had fallen, and wept bitterly afterwards; and though Peter's
denial was not a close precedent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) repentance was likely to be.

<p/>Maggie had not taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) daily walks to the Rectory for many weeks,
before the dreadful possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) some time or other becoming the
Rector's wife had been talked of so often in confidence, that ladies
were beginning to discuss how they should behave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in that
position. For Dr. Kenn, it had been understood, had sat in the
schoolroom half an hour one morning, when Miss Tulliver was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>)
lessons,--nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) had sat there every morning; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) had once walked home
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) almost _always_ walked home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>),--and if not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) in the evening. What an artful creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) was! What
a _mother_ for those children! It was enough to make poor Mrs. Kenn
turn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) grave, that they should be put under the care of this girl
only a few weeks after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) death. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) be so lost to propriety as
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) before the year was out? The masculine mind was
sarcastic, and thought _not_.

<p/>The Miss Guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly
in their Rector; at least their brother would be safe; and their
knowledge of Stephen's tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to
them, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) should come back and marry Maggie. They were not among
those who disbelieved their brother's letter; but they had no
confidence in Maggie's adherence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) renunciation of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); they
suspected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had shrunk rather from the elopement than from the
marriage, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lingered in St. Ogg's, relying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogg</b></font>) return to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). They had always thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) disagreeable; they now thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
artful and proud; having quite as good grounds for that judgment as
you and I probably have for many strong opinions of the same kind.
Formerly they had not altogether delighted in the contemplated match
with Lucy, but now their dread of a marriage between Stephen and
Maggie added its momentum to their genuine pity and indignation on
behalf of the gentle forsaken girl, in making them desire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)
should return to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). As soon as Lucy was able to leave home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this August by going to the
coast with the Miss Guests; and it was in their plans that Stephen
should be induced to join them. On the very first hint of gossip
concerning Maggie and Dr. Kenn, the report was conveyed in Miss
Guest's letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Guest</b></font>) brother.

<p/>Maggie had frequent tidings through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, or aunt Glegg, or Dr.
Kenn, of Lucy's gradual progress toward recovery, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thoughts
tended continually toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) uncle Deane's house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hungered for an
interview with Lucy, if it were only for five minutes, to utter a word
of penitence, to be assured by Lucy's own eyes and lips that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did
not believe in the willing treachery of those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had loved and
trusted. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knew that even if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) uncle's indignation had not
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) house against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), the agitation of such an interview would
have been forbidden to Lucy. Only to have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) without speaking
would have been some relief; for Maggie was haunted by a face cruel in
its very gentleness; a face that had been turned on hers with glad,
sweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory;
changed now to a sad and weary face by a first heart-stroke. And as
the days passed on, that pale image became more and more distinct; the
picture grew and grew into more speaking definiteness under the
avenging hand of remorse; the soft hazel eyes, in their look of pain,
were bent forever on Maggie, and pierced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the more because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could see no anger in them. But Lucy was not yet able to go to church,
or any place where Maggie could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and even the hope of that
departed, when the news was told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by aunt Glegg, that Lucy was
really going away in a few days to Scarborough with the Miss Guests,
who had been heard to say that they expected their brother to meet
them there.

<p/>Only those who have known what hardest inward conflict is, can know
what Maggie felt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loneliness the evening after
hearing that news from Mrs. Glegg,--only those who have known what it
is to dread their own selfish desires as the watching mother would
dread the sleeping-potion that was to still her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own pain.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat without candle in the twilight, with the window wide open
toward the river; the sense of oppressive heat adding itself
undistinguishably to the burthen of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lot. Seated on a chair against
the window, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arm on the windowsill she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was looking blankly at
the flowing river, swift with the backward-rushing tide, struggling to
see still the sweet face in its unreproaching sadness, that seemed now
from moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that
thrust itself between, and made darkness. Hearing the door open, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thought Mrs. Jakin was coming in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) supper, as usual; and with
that repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and
wretchedness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) shrank from turning round and saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) wanted
nothing; good little Mrs. Jakin would be sure to make some well-meant
remarks. But the next moment, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) having discerned the sound
of a footstep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) felt a light hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) shoulder, and heard a
voice close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) saying, <div class="bookquote">``Maggie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The face was there,--changed, but all the sweeter; the hazel eyes were
there, with their heart-piercing tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the soft voice said. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered a voice with a sharp
ring of anguish in it; and Lucy threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arms round Maggie's neck,
and leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pale cheek against the burning brow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stole out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, almost in a whisper, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sat down
close to Maggie and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``when papa and the rest were away.
Alice is come with me. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to help me. But I must only stay a
little while, because it is so late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>It was easier to say that at first than to say anything else. They sat
looking at each other. It seemed as if the interview must end without
more speech, for speech was very difficult. Each felt that there would
be something scorching in the words that would recall the
irretrievable wrong. But soon, as Maggie looked, every distinct
thought began to be overflowed by a wave of loving penitence, and
words burst forth with a sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you for coming, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sobs came thick on each other after that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, dear, be comforted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy now, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cheek against
Maggie's again. <div class="bookquote">``Don't grieve.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat still, hoping to soothe
Maggie with that gentle caress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to deceive you, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could speak. <div class="bookquote">``It always made me wretched that I felt what I didn't
like you to know. It was because I thought it would all be conquered,
and you might never see anything to wound you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``I know you never meant to make me unhappy.
It is a trouble that has come on us all; you have more to bear than I
have--and you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up, when--you did what it must have been very
hard to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were silent again a little while, sitting with clasped hands, and
cheeks leaned together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie began again, <div class="bookquote">''_he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)_ struggled too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted to be true
to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will come back to you. Forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will be happy
then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>These words were wrung forth from Maggie's deepest soul, with an
effort like the convulsed clutch of a drowning man. Lucy trembled and
was silent.

<p/>A gentle knock came at the door. It was Alice, the maid, who entered
and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daren't stay any longer, Miss Deane. They'll find it out, and
there'll be such anger at your coming out so late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy rose and said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, Alice,--in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm to go away on Friday, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) added, when Alice had closed
the door again. <div class="bookquote">``When I come back, and am strong, they will let me do
as I like. I shall come to you when I please then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, with another great effort, <div class="bookquote">``I pray to God
continually that I may never be the cause of sorrow to you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pressed the little hand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held between hers, and looked up
into the face that was bent over hers. Lucy never forgot that look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, in a low voice, that had the solemnity of
confession in it, <div class="bookquote">``you are better than I am. I can't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) broke off there, and said no more. But they clasped each other
again in a last embrace.



<p/>Chapter V

<p/>The Last Conflict


<p/>In the second week of September, Maggie was again sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
lonely room, battling with the old shadowy enemies that were forever
slain and rising again. It was past midnight, and the rain was beating
heavily against the window, driven with fitful force by the rushing,
loud-moaning wind. For the day after Lucy's visit there had been a
sudden change in the weather; the heat and drought had given way to
cold variable winds, and heavy falls of rain at intervals; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
been forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until the weather
should become more settled. In the counties higher up the Floss the
rains had been continuous, and the completion of the harvest had been
arrested. And now, for the last two days, the rains on this lower
course of the river had been incessant, so that the old men had shaken
their heads and talked of sixty years ago, when the same sort of
weather, happening about the equinox, brought on the great floods,
which swept the bridge away, and reduced the town to great misery. But
the younger generation, who had seen several small floods, thought
lightly of these sombre recollections and forebodings; and Bob Jakin,
naturally prone to take a hopeful view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) own luck, laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>)
mother when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) regretted their having taken a house by the riverside,
observing that but for that they would have had no boats, which were
the most lucky of possessions in case of a flood that obliged them to
go to a distance for food.

<p/>But the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds
now. There was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow;
threatenings of a worse kind, from sudden thaws after falls of snow,
had often passed off, in the experience of the younger ones; and at
the very worst, the banks would be sure to break lower down the river
when the tide came in with violence, and so the waters would be
carried off, without causing more than temporary inconvenience, and
losses that would be felt only by the poorer sort, whom charity would
relieve.

<p/>All were in their beds now, for it was past midnight; all except some
solitary watchers such as Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) little parlor
toward the river, with one candle, that left everything dim in the
room except a letter which lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on the table. That letter,
which had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to-day, was one of the causes that had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
up far on into the night, unconscious how the hours were going,
careless of seeking rest, with no image of rest coming across her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mind, except of that far, far off rest from which there would be no
more waking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into this struggling earthly life.

<p/>Two days before Maggie received that letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been to the
Rectory for the last time. The heavy rain would have prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
from going since; but there was another reason. Dr. Kenn, at first
enlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and
slander had taken in relation to Maggie, had recently been made more
fully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) male
parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt to
overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of
resistance. Dr. Kenn, having a conscience void of offence in the
matter, was still inclined to persevere,--was still averse to give way
before a public sentiment that was odious and contemptible; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) was
finally wrought upon by the consideration of the peculiar
responsibility attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) office, of avoiding the appearance of
evil,--an <div class="bookquote">``appearance''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that is always dependent on the average quality
of surrounding minds. Where these minds are low and gross, the area of
that <div class="bookquote">``appearance''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is proportionately widened. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) was in danger
of acting from obstinacy; perhaps it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) duty to succumb.
Conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which is the
most painful course; and to recede was always painful to Dr. Kenn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) must advise Maggie to go away from St. Ogg's
for a time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) performed that difficult task with as much delicacy
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) could, only stating in vague terms that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) attempt to
countenance her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stay was a source of discord between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>)
parishioners, that was likely to obstruct his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) usefulness as a
clergyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) to write to a clerical friend of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>), who might possibly take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenn</b></font>) own family as governess;
and, if not, would probably know of some other available position for
a young woman in whose welfare Dr. Kenn felt a strong interest.

<p/>Poor Maggie listened with a trembling lip; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could say nothing but a
faint <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I shall be grateful'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walked back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
lodgings, through the driving rain, with a new sense of desolation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must be a lonely wanderer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must go out among fresh faces, that
would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wonderingly, because the days did not seem joyful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must begin a new life, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have to rouse
herself to receive new impressions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was so unspeakably,
sickeningly weary! There was no home, no help for the erring; even
those who pitied were constrained to hardness. But ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
complain? Ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to shrink in this way from the long penance of
life, which was all the possibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had of lightening the load to
some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new
force of unselfish human love? All the next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lonely
room, with a window darkened by the cloud and the driving rain,
thinking of that future, and wrestling for patience; for what repose
could poor Maggie ever win except by wrestling?

<p/>And on the third day--this day of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had just sat out the
close--the letter had come which was lying on the table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/>The letter was from Stephen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was come back from Holland; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was at
Mudport again, unknown to any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) friends, and had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
from that place, enclosing the letter to a person whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) trusted in
St. Ogg's. From beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach;
an appeal against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) useless sacrifice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), of herself, against
that perverted notion of right which led her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to crush all his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hopes,
for the sake of a mere idea, and not any substantial good,--_his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)_
hopes, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loved, and who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with that single overpowering
passion, that worship, which a man never gives to a woman more than
once in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.

<p/>``They have written to me that you are to marry Kenn. As if I should
believe that! Perhaps they have told you some such fables about me.
Perhaps they tell you I've been <div class="bookquote">``travelling.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My body has been dragged
about somewhere; but _I_ have never travelled from the hideous place
where you left me; where I started up from the stupor of helpless rage
to find you gone.

<p/>``Maggie! whose pain can have been like mine? Whose injury is like
mine? Who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt
itself into my soul, so that no other image can come there? Maggie,
call me back to you! Call me back to life and goodness! I am banished
from both now. I have no motives; I am indifferent to everything. Two
months have only deepened the certainty that I can never care for life
without you. Write me one word; say ``Come!<div class="bookquote">'' In two days I should be
with you. Maggie, have you forgotten what it was to be together,--to
be within reach of a look, to be within hearing of each other's
voice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>When Maggie first read this letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) real temptation
had only just begun. At the entrance of the chill dark cavern, we turn
with unworn courage from the warm light; but how, when we have trodden
far in the damp darkness, and have begun to be faint and weary; how,
if there is a sudden opening above us, and we are invited back again
to the life-nourishing day? The leap of natural longing from under the
pressure of pain is so strong, that all less immediate motives are
likely to be forgotten--till the pain has been escaped from.

<p/>For hours Maggie felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) struggle had been in vain. For hours
every other thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) strove to summon was thrust aside by the
image of Stephen waiting for the single word that would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did not _read_ the letter: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) uttering it, and the
voice shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with its old strange power. All the day before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
been filled with the vision of a lonely future through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must
carry the burthen of regret, upheld only by clinging faith. And here,
close within her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reach, urging itself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) even as a claim, was
another future, in which hard endurance and effort were to be
exchanged for easy, delicious leaning on another's loving strength!
And yet that promise of joy in the place of sadness did not make the
dire force of the temptation to Maggie.

<p/>It was Stephen's tone of misery, it was the doubt in the justice of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own resolve, that made the balance tremble, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) once
start from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seat to reach the pen and paper, and write <div class="bookquote">``Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Mr. Stephen Guest/Stephen Guest</b></font>)</div><p/>But close upon that decisive act, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind recoiled; and the sense of
contradiction with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) past self in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moments of strength and
clearness came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) like a pang of conscious degradation. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
must wait; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must pray; the light that had forsaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would come
again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should feel again what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had felt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had fled away,
under an inspiration strong enough to conquer agony,--to conquer love;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should feel again what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had felt when Lucy stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), when
Philip's letter had stirred all the fibres that bound her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to the
calmer past.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sat quite still, far on into the night, with no impulse to change
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) attitude, without active force enough even for the mental act of
prayer; only waiting for the light that would surely come again. It
came with the memories that no passion could long quench; the long
past came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and with it the fountains of self-renouncing
pity and affection, of faithfulness and resolve. The words that were
marked by the quiet hand in the little old book that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had long ago
learned by heart, rushed even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lips, and found a vent for
themselves in a low murmur that was quite lost in the loud driving of
the rain against the window and the loud moan and roar of the wind. <div class="bookquote">``I
have received the Cross, I have received it from Thy hand; I will bear
it, and bear it till death, as Thou hast laid it upon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But soon other words rose that could find no utterance but in a
sob,--<div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Stephen! It will pass away. You will come back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took up the letter, held it to the candle, and let it burn slowly
on the hearth. To-morrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the last word of
parting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will bear it, and bear it till death. But how long it will be
before death comes! I am so young, so healthy. How shall I have
patience and strength? Am I to struggle and fall and repent again? Has
life other trials as hard for me still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>With that cry of self-despair, Maggie fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees against the
table, and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sorrow-stricken face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) soul went out to the
Unseen Pity that would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to the end. Surely there was
something being taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by this experience of great need; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
must be learning a secret of human tenderness and long-suffering, that
the less erring could hardly know? <div class="bookquote">``O God, if my life is to be long,
let me live to bless and comfort--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees and feet; it was water flowing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) started up;
the stream was flowing under the door that led into the passage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was not bewildered for an instant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew it was the flood!

<p/>The tumult of emotion she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been enduring for the last twelve hours
seemed to have left a great calm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); without screaming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hurried with the candle upstairs to Bob Jakin's bedroom. The door was
ajar; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went in and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) by the shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob, the flood is come! it is in the house; let us see if we can make
the boats safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) candle, while the poor wife, snatching up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) baby,
burst into screams; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hurried down again to see if the
waters were rising fast. There was a step down into the room at the
door leading from the staircase; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw that the water was already on
a level with the step. While she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was looking, something came with a
tremendous crash against the window, and sent the leaded panes and the
old wooden framework inward in shivers, the water pouring in after it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the boat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>cried Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Bob, come down to get the boats!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And without a moment's shudder of fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) plunged through the water,
which was rising fast to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees, and by the glimmering light of the
candle she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had left on the stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mounted on to the window-sill,
and crept into the boat, which was left with the prow lodging and
protruding through the window. Bob was not long after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), hurrying
without shoes or stockings, but with the lanthorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, they're both here,--both the boats,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) got into
the one where Maggie was. <div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful this fastening isn't broke
too, as well as the mooring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div><p/>In the excitement of getting into the other boat, unfastening it, and
mastering an oar, Bob was not struck with the danger Maggie incurred.
We are not apt to fear for the fearless, when we are companions in
their danger, and Bob's mind was absorbed in possible expedients for
the safety of the helpless indoors. The fact that Maggie had been up,
had waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), and had taken the lead in activity, gave Bob a vague
impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as one who would help to protect, not need to be
protected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) too had got possession of an oar, and had pushed off,
so as to release the boat from the overhanging window-frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The water's rising so fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>said Bob, <div class="bookquote">``I doubt it'll be in at the
chambers before long,--th' house is so low. I've more mind to get
Prissy and the child and the mother into the boat, if I could, and
trusten to the water,--for th' old house is none so safe. And if I let
go the boat--but _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob/Bob Jakin/Jakin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) exclaimed, suddenly lifting the light of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) lanthorn on Maggie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood in the rain with the oar in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hand and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) black hair streaming.

<p/>Maggie had no time to answer, for a new tidal current swept along the
line of the houses, and drove both the boats out on to the wide water,
with a force that carried them far past the meeting current of the
river.

<p/>In the first moments Maggie felt nothing, thought of nothing, but that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had suddenly passed away from that life which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been
dreading; it was the transition of death, without its agony,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was alone in the darkness with God.

<p/>The whole thing had been so rapid, so dreamlike, that the threads of
ordinary association were broken; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sank down on the seat clutching
the oar mechanically, and for a long while had no distinct conception
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) position. The first thing that waked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to fuller
consciousness was the cessation of the rain, and a perception that the
darkness was divided by the faintest light, which parted the
overhanging gloom from the immeasurable watery level below. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
driven out upon the flood,--that awful visitation of God which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father used to talk of; which had made the nightmare of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) childish
dreams. And with that thought there rushed in the vision of the old
home, and Tom, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother,--they had all listened together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O God, where am I? Which is the way home?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cried out, in the dim
loneliness.

<p/>What was happening to them at the Mill? The flood had once nearly
destroyed it. They might be in danger, in distress,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother, alone there, beyond reach of help! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whole soul was
strained now on that thought; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw the long-loved faces looking
for help into the darkness, and finding none.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was floating in smooth water now,--perhaps far on the overflooded
fields. There was no sense of present danger to check the outgoing of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind to the old home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes against the
curtain of gloom that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might seize the first sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
whereabout,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might catch some faint suggestion of the spot
toward which all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anxieties tended.

<p/>Oh, how welcome, the widening of that dismal watery level, the gradual
uplifting of the cloudy firmament, the slowly defining blackness of
objects above the glassy dark! Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must be out on the fields;
those were the tops of hedgerow trees. Which way did the river lie?
Looking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw the lines of black trees; looking before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), there were none; then the river lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seized an oar
and began to paddle the boat forward with the energy of wakening hope;
the dawning seemed to advance more swiftly, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was in action; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could soon see the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously on a mound
where they had taken refuge. Onward she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) paddled and rowed by turns in
the growing twilight; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wet clothes clung round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
streaming hair was dashed about by the wind, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was hardly
conscious of any bodily sensations,--except a sensation of strength,
inspired by mighty emotion. Along with the sense of danger and
possible rescue for those long-remembered beings at the old home,
there was an undefined sense of reconcilement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother; what
quarrel, what harshness, what unbelief in each other can subsist in
the presence of a great calamity, when all the artificial vesture of
our life is gone, and we are all one with each other in primitive
mortal needs? Vaguely Maggie felt this, in the strong resurgent love
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brother that swept away all the later impressions of hard,
cruel offence and misunderstanding, and left only the deep,
underlying, unshakable memories of early union.

<p/>But now there was a large dark mass in the distance, and near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
Maggie could discern the current of the river. The dark mass must
be--yes, it was--St. Ogg's. Ah, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew which way to look for the
first glimpse of the well-known trees--the gray willows, the now
yellowing chestnuts--and above them the old roof! But there was no
color, no shape yet; all was faint and dim. More and more strongly the
energies seemed to come and put themselves forth, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life were
a stored-up force that was being spent in this hour, unneeded for any
future.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must get her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) boat into the current of the Floss, else she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would
never be able to pass the Ripple and approach the house; this was the
thought that occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagined with more and more
vividness the state of things round the old home. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might
be carried very far down, and be unable to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) boat out of the
current again. For the first time distinct ideas of danger began to
press upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); but there was no choice of courses, no room for
hesitation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) floated into the current. Swiftly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went now
without effort; more and more clearly in the lessening distance and
the growing light she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began to discern the objects that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew must
be the well-known trees and roofs; nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not far off a rushing,
muddy current that must be the strangely altered Ripple.

<p/>Great God! there were floating masses in it, that might dash against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) boat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) passed, and cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to perish too soon. What were
those masses?

<p/>For the first time Maggie's heart began to beat in an agony of dread.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat helpless, dimly conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was being floated along,
more intensely conscious of the anticipated clash. But the horror was
transient; it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of St. Ogg's.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had passed the mouth of the Ripple, then; _now_, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must use all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) skill and power to manage the boat and get it if possible out of
the current. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could see now that the bridge was broken down; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could see the masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery
field. But no boats were to be seen moving on the river,--such as had
been laid hands on were employed in the flooded streets.

<p/>With new resolution, Maggie seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) oar, and stood up again to
paddle; but the now ebbing tide added to the swiftness of the river,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was carried along beyond the bridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could hear shouts
from the windows overlooking the river, as if the people there were
calling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). It was not till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had passed on nearly to Tofton
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could get the boat clear of the current. Then with one
yearning look toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) uncle Deane's house that lay farther down the
river, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took to both her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) oars and rowed with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might across
the watery fields, back toward the Mill. Color was beginning to awake
now, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) approached the Dorlcote fields, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could discern the
tints of the trees, could see the old Scotch firs far to the right,
and the home chestnuts,--oh, how deep they lay in the water,--deeper
than the trees on this side the hill! And the roof of the Mill--where
was it? Those heavy fragments hurrying down the Ripple,--what had they
meant? But it was not the house,--the house stood firm; drowned up to
the first story, but still firm,--or was it broken in at the end
toward the Mill?

<p/>With panting joy that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was there at last,--joy that overcame all
distress,--Maggie neared the front of the house. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard no
sound; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw no object moving. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) boat was on a level with the
upstairs window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) called out in a loud, piercing voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, where are you? Mother, where are you? Here is Maggie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon, from the window of the attic in the central gable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard
Tom's voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it? Have you brought a boat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I, Tom,--Maggie. Where is mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is not here; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to Garum the day before yesterday. I'll
come down to the lower window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alone, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
opened the middle window, on a level with the boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you. Get in
quickly. Is there no one else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>said Tom, stepping into the boat; <div class="bookquote">``I fear the man is drowned; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was carried down the Ripple, I think, when part of the Mill fell with
the crash of trees and stones against it; I've shouted again and
again, and there has been no answer. Give me the oars, Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the wide
water,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face to face with Maggie,--that the full meaning of what
had happened rushed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind. It came with so overpowering a
force,--it was such a new revelation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spirit, of the depths in
life that had lain beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) vision, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had fancied so keen and
clear,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was unable to ask a question. They sat mutely gazing
at each other,--Maggie with eyes of intense life looking out from a
weary, beaten face; Tom pale, with a certain awe and humiliation.
Thought was busy though the lips were silent; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could ask
no question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) guessed a story of almost miraculous, divinely
protected effort. But at last a mist gathered over the blue-gray eyes,
and the lips found a word they could utter,--the old childish
<div class="bookquote">``Magsie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie could make no answer but a long, deep sob of that mysterious,
wondrous happiness that is one with pain.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``We will go to Lucy, Tom; we'll
go and see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is safe, and then we can help the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom rowed with untired vigor, and with a different speed from poor
Maggie's. The boat was soon in the current of the river again, and
soon they would be at Tofton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Park House stands high up out of the flood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Miss Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
they have got Lucy there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing else was said; a new danger was being carried toward them by
the river. Some wooden machinery had just given way on one of the
wharves, and huge fragments were being floated along. The sun was
rising now, and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in
dreadful clearness around them; in dreadful clearness floated onward
the hurrying, threatening masses. A large company in a boat that was
working its way along under the Tofton houses observed their danger,
and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Get out of the current!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But that could not be done at once; and Tom, looking before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), saw
death rushing on them. Huge fragments, clinging together in fatal
fellowship, made one wide mass across the stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is coming, Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tulliver/Tom Tulliver</b></font>)</div>Tom said, in a deep, hoarse voice, loosing the
oars, and clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).

<p/>The next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water, and the
huge mass was hurrying on in hideous triumph.

<p/>But soon the keel of the boat reappeared, a black speck on the golden
water.

<p/>The boat reappeared, but brother and sister had gone down in an
embrace never to be parted; living through again in one supreme moment
the days when they had clasped their little hands in love, and roamed
the daisied fields together.

<p/>Conclusion

<p/>Nature repairs her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ravages,--repairs them with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sunshine, and with
human labor. The desolation wrought by that flood had left little
visible trace on the face of the earth, five years after. The fifth
autumn was rich in golden cornstacks, rising in thick clusters among
the distant hedgerows; the wharves and warehouses on the Floss were
busy again, with echoes of eager voices, with hopeful lading and
unlading.

<p/>And every man and woman mentioned in this history was still living,
except those whose end we know.

<p/>Nature repairs her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ravages, but not all. The uptorn trees are not
rooted again; the parted hills are left scarred; if there is a new
growth, the trees are not the same as the old, and the hills
underneath their green vesture bear the marks of the past rending. To
the eyes that have dwelt on the past, there is no thorough repair.

<p/>Dorlcote Mill was rebuilt. And Dorlcote churchyard--where the brick
grave that held a father whom we know, was found with the stone laid
prostrate upon it after the flood--had recovered all its grassy order
and decent quiet.

<p/>Near that brick grave there was a tomb erected, very soon after the
flood, for two bodies that were found in close embrace; and it was
visited at different moments by two men who both felt that their
keenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever buried there.

<p/>One of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but
that was years after.

<p/>The other was always solitary. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) great companionship was among the
trees of the Red Deeps, where the buried joy seemed still to hover,
like a revisiting spirit.

<p/>The tomb bore the names of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, and below the
names it was written,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In their death they were not divided.''
