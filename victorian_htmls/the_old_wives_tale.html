<p/>To W. W. K.




<p/>PREFACE TO THIS EDITION

<p/>In the autumn of 1903 I used to dine frequently in a restaurant in the
Rue de Clichy, Paris. Here were, among others, two waitresses that
attracted my attention. One was a beautiful, pale young girl, to whom I
never spoke, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was employed far away from the table which I
affected. The other, a stout, middle-aged managing Breton woman, had
sole command over my table and me, and gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to assume
such a maternal tone towards me that I saw I should be compelled to
leave that restaurant. If I was absent for a couple of nights running
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would reproach me sharply: <div class="bookquote">``What! you are unfaithful to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Once,
when I complained about some French beans, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) informed me roundly that
French beans were a subject which I did not understand. I then decided
to be eternally unfaithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and I abandoned the restaurant. A
few nights before the final parting an old woman came into the
restaurant to dine. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy to see
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
developed the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the
thoughtless. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was burdened with a lot of small parcels, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
kept dropping. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chose one seat; and then, not liking it, chose
another; and then another. In a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the whole
restaurant laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). That my middle-aged Breton should laugh was
indifferent to me, but I was pained to see a coarse grimace of giggling
on the pale face of the beautiful young waitress to whom I had never
spoken.

<p/>I reflected, concerning the grotesque diner: <div class="bookquote">``This woman was once
young, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous
mannerisms. Very probably she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) singularities. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel
out of the history of a woman such as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Every stout, ageing woman
is not grotesque--far from it!--but there is an extreme pathos in the
mere fact that every stout ageing woman was once a young girl with the
unique charm of youth in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) form and movements and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind. And
the fact that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman
is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each
unperceived by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), only intensifies the pathos.

<p/>It was at this instant that I was visited by the idea of writing the
book which ultimately became <div class="bookquote">``The Old Wives' Tale.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Of course I felt
that the woman who caused the ignoble mirth in the restaurant would not
serve me as a type of heroine. For she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was much too old and obviously
unsympathetic. It is an absolute rule that the principal character of a
novel must not be unsympathetic, and the whole modern tendency of
realistic fiction is against oddness in a prominent figure. I knew that
I must choose the sort of woman who would pass unnoticed in a crowd.

<p/>I put the idea aside for a long time, but it was never very distant
from me. For several reasons it made a special appeal to me. I had
always been a convinced admirer of Mrs. W. K. Clifford's most precious
novel, <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. W. K. Clifford</b></font>)</div>but I wanted to see in the story of an old woman
many things that Mrs. W. K. Clifford had omitted from <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Anne.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. W. K. Clifford</b></font>)</div>Moreover, I had always revolted against the absurd youthfulness, the
unfading youthfulness of the average heroine. And as a protest against
this fashion, I was already, in 1903, planning a novel -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Leonora'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-RRB- of
which the heroine was aged forty, and had daughters old enough to be in
love. The reviewers, by the way, were staggered by my hardihood in
offering a woman of forty as a subject of serious interest to the
public. But I meant to go much farther than forty! Finally as a supreme
reason, I had the example and the challenge of Guy de Maupassant's <div class="bookquote">``Une
Vie.''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy de Maupassant</b></font>)</div>In the nineties we used to regard <div class="bookquote">``Une Vie''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with mute awe, as
being the summit of achievement in fiction. And I remember being very
cross with Mr. Bernard Shaw because, having read <div class="bookquote">``Une Vie''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bernard Shaw</b></font>)</div>at the
suggestion -LRB-I think-RRB- of Mr. William Archer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) failed to see in it
anything very remarkable. Here I must confess that, in 1908, I read
<div class="bookquote">``Une Vie''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>again, and in spite of a natural anxiety to differ from Mr.
Bernard Shaw, I was gravely disappointed with it. It is a fine novel,
but decidedly inferior to <div class="bookquote">``Pierre et Jean''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or even <div class="bookquote">``Fort Comme la
Mort.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>To return to the year 1903. <div class="bookquote">``Une Vie''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>relates the entire life
history of a woman. I settled in the privacy of my own head that my
book about the development of a young girl into a stout old lady must
be the English <div class="bookquote">``Une Vie.''  (<font color='red'><b>a stout lady</b></font>)</div>I have been accused of every fault except a
lack of self-confidence, and in a few weeks I settled a further point,
namely, that my book must <div class="bookquote">``go one better''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>than <div class="bookquote">``Une Vie,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and that to
this end it must be the life-history of two women instead of only one.
Hence, <div class="bookquote">``The Old Wives' Tale''  (<font color='red'><b>heroines</b></font>)</div>has two heroines. Constance was the
original; Sophia was created out of bravado, just to indicate that I
declined to consider Guy de Maupassant as the last forerunner of the
deluge. I was intimidated by the audacity of my project, but I had
sworn to carry it out. For several years I looked it squarely in the
face at intervals, and then walked away to write novels of smaller
scope, of which I produced five or six. But I could not dally forever,
and in the autumn of 1907 I actually began to write it, in a village
near Fontainebleau, where I rented half a house from a retired railway
servant. I calculated that it would be 200,000 words long -LRB-which it
exactly proved to be-RRB-, and I had a vague notion that no novel of such
dimensions -LRB-except Richardson's-RRB- had ever been written before. So I
counted the words in several famous Victorian novels, and discovered to
my relief that the famous Victorian novels average 400,000 words
apiece. I wrote the first part of the novel in six weeks. It was fairly
easy to me, because, in the seventies, in the first decade of my life,
I had lived in the actual draper's shop of the Baines's, and knew it as
only a child could know it. Then I went to London on a visit. I tried
to continue the book in a London hotel, but London was too distracting,
and I put the thing away, and during January and February of 1908, I
wrote <div class="bookquote">``Buried Alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which was published immediately, and was received
with majestic indifference by the English public, an indifference which
has persisted to this day.

<p/>I then returned to the Fontainebleau region and gave <div class="bookquote">``The Old Wives'
Tale''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>no rest till I finished it at the end of July, 1908. It was
published in the autumn of the same year, and for six weeks afterward
the English public steadily confirmed an opinion expressed by a certain
person in whose judgment I had confidence, to the effect that the work
was honest but dull, and that when it was not dull it had a regrettable
tendency to facetiousness. My publishers, though brave fellows, were
somewhat disheartened; however, the reception of the book gradually
became less and less frigid.

<p/>With regard to the French portion of the story, it was not until I had
written the first part that I saw from a study of my chronological
basis that the Siege of Paris might be brought into the tale. The idea
was seductive; but I hated, and still hate, the awful business of
research; and I only knew the Paris of the Twentieth Century. Now I was
aware that my railway servant and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wife had been living in Paris at
the time of the war. I said to the old man, <div class="bookquote">``By the way, you went
through the Siege of Paris, didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old wife and
said, uncertainly, <div class="bookquote">``The Siege of Paris? Yes, we did, didn't we?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>The
Siege of Paris had been only one incident among many in their lives. Of
course, they remembered it well, though not vividly, and I gained much
information from them. But the most useful thing which I gained from
them was the perception, startling at first, that ordinary people went
on living very ordinary lives in Paris during the siege, and that to
the vast mass of the population the siege was not the dramatic,
spectacular, thrilling, ecstatic affair that is described in history.
Encouraged by this perception, I decided to include the siege in my
scheme. I read Sarcey's diary of the siege aloud to my wife, and I
looked at the pictures in Jules Claretie's popular work on the siege
and the commune, and I glanced at the printed collection of official
documents, and there my research ended.

<p/>It has been asserted that unless I had actually been present at a
public execution, I could not have written the chapter in which Sophia
was at the Auxerre solemnity. I have not been present at a public
execution, as the whole of my information about public executions was
derived from a series of articles on them which I read in the Paris
Matin. Mr. Frank Harris, discussing my book in <div class="bookquote">``Vanity Fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Frank Harris</b></font>)</div>said it
was clear that I had not seen an execution, -LRB-or words to that effect-RRB-,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) proceeded to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) own description of an execution. It was a
brief but terribly convincing bit of writing, quite characteristic and
quite worthy of the author of <div class="bookquote">``Montes the Matador''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>and of a man who has
been almost everywhere and seen almost everything. I comprehended how
far short I had fallen of the truth! I wrote to Mr. Frank Harris,
regretting that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) description had not been printed before I wrote
mine, as I should assuredly have utilized it, and, of course, I
admitted that I had never witnessed an execution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) simply replied:
<div class="bookquote">``Neither have I.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>This detail is worth preserving, for it is a reproof
to that large body of readers, who, when a novelist has really carried
conviction to them, assert off hand: <div class="bookquote">``O, that must be autobiography!''

<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>THE SQUARE

<p/>I


<p/>Those two girls, Constance and Sophia Baines, paid no heed to the
manifold interest of their situation, of which, indeed, they had never
been conscious. They were, for example, established almost precisely on
the fifty-third parallel of latitude. A little way to the north of
them, in the creases of a hill famous for its religious orgies, rose
the river Trent, the calm and characteristic stream of middle England.
Somewhat further northwards, in the near neighbourhood of the highest
public-house in the realm, rose two lesser rivers, the Dane and the
Dove, which, quarrelling in early infancy, turned their backs on each
other, and, the one by favour of the Weaver and the other by favour of
the Trent, watered between them the whole width of England, and poured
themselves respectively into the Irish Sea and the German Ocean. What a
county of modest, unnoticed rivers! What a natural, simple county,
content to fix its boundaries by these tortuous island brooks, with
their comfortable names--Trent, Mease, Dove, Tern, Dane, Mees, Stour,
Tame, and even hasty Severn! Not that the Severn is suitable to the
county! In the county excess is deprecated. The county is happy in not
exciting remark. It is content that Shropshire should possess that
swollen bump, the Wrekin, and that the exaggerated wildness of the Peak
should lie over its border. It does not desire to be a pancake like
Cheshire. It has everything that England has, including thirty miles of
Watling Street; and England can show nothing more beautiful and nothing
uglier than the works of nature and the works of man to be seen within
the limits of the county. It is England in little, lost in the midst of
England, unsung by searchers after the extreme; perhaps occasionally
somewhat sore at this neglect, but how proud in the instinctive
cognizance of its representative features and traits!

<p/>Constance and Sophia, busy with the intense preoccupations of youth,
recked not of such matters. They were surrounded by the county. On
every side the fields and moors of Staffordshire, intersected by roads
and lanes, railways, watercourses and telegraph-lines, patterned by
hedges, ornamented and made respectable by halls and genteel parks,
enlivened by villages at the intersections, and warmly surveyed by the
sun, spread out undulating. And trains were rushing round curves in
deep cuttings, and carts and waggons trotting and jingling on the
yellow roads, and long, narrow boats passing in a leisure majestic and
infinite over the surface of the stolid canals; the rivers had only
themselves to support, for Staffordshire rivers have remained virgin of
keels to this day. One could imagine the messages concerning prices,
sudden death, and horses, in their flight through the wires under the
feet of birds. In the inns Utopians were shouting the universe into
order over beer, and in the halls and parks the dignity of England was
being preserved in a fitting manner. The villages were full of women
who did nothing but fight against dirt and hunger, and repair the
effects of friction on clothes. Thousands of labourers were in the
fields, but the fields were so broad and numerous that this scattered
multitude was totally lost therein. The cuckoo was much more
perceptible than man, dominating whole square miles with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resounding
call. And on the airy moors heath-larks played in the ineffaceable
mule-tracks that had served centuries before even the Romans thought of
Watling Street. In short, the usual daily life of the county was
proceeding with all its immense variety and importance; but though
Constance and Sophia were in it they were not of it.

<p/>The fact is, that while in the county they were also in the district;
and no person who lives in the district, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) should be old and
have nothing to do but reflect upon things in general, ever thinks
about the county. So far as the county goes, the district might almost
as well be in the middle of the Sahara. It ignores the county, save
that it uses it nonchalantly sometimes as leg-stretcher on holiday
afternoons, as a man may use his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back garden. It has nothing in common
with the county; it is richly sufficient to itself. Nevertheless, its
self-sufficiency and the true salt savour of its life can only be
appreciated by picturing it hemmed in by county. It lies on the face of
the county like an insignificant stain, like a dark Pleiades in a green
and empty sky. And Hanbridge has the shape of a horse and its rider,
Bursley of half a donkey, Knype of a pair of trousers, Longshaw of an
octopus, and little Turnhill of a beetle. The Five Towns seem to cling
together for safety. Yet the idea of clinging together for safety would
make them laugh. They are unique and indispensable. From the north of
the county right down to the south they alone stand for civilization,
applied science, organized manufacture, and the century--until you come
to Wolverhampton. They are unique and indispensable because you cannot
drink tea out of a teacup without the aid of the Five Towns; because
you cannot eat a meal in decency without the aid of the Five Towns. For
this the architecture of the Five Towns is an architecture of ovens and
chimneys; for this its atmosphere is as black as its mud; for this it
burns and smokes all night, so that Longshaw has been compared to hell;
for this it is unlearned in the ways of agriculture, never having seen
corn except as packing straw and in quartern loaves; for this, on the
other hand, it comprehends the mysterious habits of fire and pure,
sterile earth; for this it lives crammed together in slippery streets
where the housewife must change white window-curtains at least once a
fortnight if she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) wishes to remain respectable; for this it gets up in
the mass at six a.m., winter and summer, and goes to bed when the
public-houses close; for this it exists--that you may drink tea out of
a teacup and toy with a chop on a plate. All the everyday crockery used
in the kingdom is made in the Five Towns--all, and much besides. A
district capable of such gigantic manufacture, of such a perfect
monopoly--and which finds energy also to produce coal and iron and
great men--may be an insignificant stain on a county, considered
geographically, but it is surely well justified in treating the county
as its back garden once a week, and in blindly ignoring it the rest of
the time.

<p/>Even the majestic thought that whenever and wherever in all England a
woman washes up, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) washes up the product of the district; that
whenever and wherever in all England a plate is broken the fracture
means new business for the district--even this majestic thought had
probably never occurred to either of the girls. The fact is, that while
in the Five Towns they were also in the Square, Bursley and the Square
ignored the staple manufacture as perfectly as the district ignored the
county. Bursley has the honours of antiquity in the Five Towns. No
industrial development can ever rob it of its superiority in age, which
makes it absolutely sure in its conceit. And the time will never come
when the other towns--let them swell and bluster as they may--will not
pronounce the name of Bursley as one pronounces the name of one's
mother. Add to this that the Square was the centre of Bursley's retail
trade -LRB-which scorned the staple as something wholesale, vulgar, and
assuredly filthy-RRB-, and you will comprehend the importance and the
self-isolation of the Square in the scheme of the created universe.
There you have it, embedded in the district, and the district embedded
in the county, and the county lost and dreaming in the heart of England!

<p/>The Square was named after St. Luke. The Evangelist might have been
startled by certain phenomena in his (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) square, but, except in Wakes Week,
when the shocking always happened, St. Luke's Square lived in a manner
passably saintly--though it contained five public-houses. It contained
five public-houses, a bank, a barber's, a confectioner's, three
grocers', two chemists', an ironmonger's, a clothier's, and five
drapers'. These were all the catalogue. St. Luke's Square had no room
for minor establishments. The aristocracy of the Square undoubtedly
consisted of the drapers -LRB-for the bank was impersonal-RRB-; and among the
five the shop of Baines stood supreme. No business establishment could
possibly be more respected than that of Mr. Baines was respected. And
though John Baines had been bedridden for a dozen years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) still lived
on the lips of admiring, ceremonious burgesses as `our honoured
fellow-townsman.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) deserved his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reputation.

<p/>The Baines's shop, to make which three dwellings had at intervals been
thrown into one, lay at the bottom of the Square. It formed about
one-third of the south side of the Square, the remainder being made up
of Critchlow's -LRB-chemist-RRB-, the clothier's, and the Hanover Spirit
Vaults. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Vaults''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a favourite synonym of the public-house in the
Square. Only two of the public-houses were crude public-houses: the
rest were <div class="bookquote">``vaults.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB- It was a composite building of three storeys, in
blackish-crimson brick, with a projecting shop-front and, above and
behind that, two rows of little windows. On the sash of each window was
a red cloth roll stuffed with sawdust, to prevent draughts; plain white
blinds descended about six inches from the top of each window. There
were no curtains to any of the windows save one; this was the window of
the drawing-room, on the first floor at the corner of the Square and
King Street. Another window, on the second storey, was peculiar, in
that it had neither blind nor pad, and was very dirty; this was the
window of an unused room that had a separate staircase to itself, the
staircase being barred by a door always locked. Constance and Sophia
had lived in continual expectation of the abnormal issuing from that
mysterious room, which was next to their own. But they were
disappointed. The room had no shameful secret except the incompetence
of the architect who had made one house out of three; it was just an
empty, unemployable room. The building had also a considerable frontage
on King Street, where, behind the shop, was sheltered the parlour, with
a large window and a door that led directly by two steps into the
street. A strange peculiarity of the shop was that it bore no
signboard. Once it had had a large signboard which a memorable gale had
blown into the Square. Mr. Baines had decided not to replace it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had
always objected to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``puffing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and for this reason would
never hear of such a thing as a clearance sale. The hatred of <div class="bookquote">``puffing''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>grew on him (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) came to regard even a sign as <div class="bookquote">``puffing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Uninformed persons who wished to find Baines's must ask and learn. For
Mr. Baines, to have replaced the sign would have been to condone, yea,
to participate in, the modern craze for unscrupulous
self-advertisement. This abstention of Mr. Baines's from indulgence in
signboards was somehow accepted by the more thoughtful members of the
community as evidence that the height of Mr. Baines's principles was
greater even than they had imagined.

<p/>Constance and Sophia were the daughters of this credit to human nature.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had no other children.

<p/>II

<p/>They pressed their noses against the window of the show-room, and gazed
down into the Square as perpendicularly as the projecting front of the
shop would allow. The show-room was over the millinery and silken half
of the shop. Over the woollen and shirting half were the drawing-room
and the chief bedroom. When in quest of articles of coquetry, you
mounted from the shop by a curving stair, and your head gradually rose
level with a large apartment having a mahogany counter in front of the
window and along one side, yellow linoleum on the floor, many cardboard
boxes, a magnificent hinged cheval glass, and two chairs. The
window-sill being lower than the counter, there was a gulf between the
panes and the back of the counter, into which important articles such
as scissors, pencils, chalk, and artificial flowers were continually
disappearing: another proof of the architect's incompetence.

<p/>The girls could only press their noses against the window by kneeling
on the counter, and this they were doing. Constance's nose was snub,
but agreeably so. Sophia had a fine Roman nose; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a beautiful
creature, beautiful and handsome at the same time. They were both of
them rather like racehorses, quivering with delicate, sensitive, and
luxuriant life; exquisite, enchanting proof of the circulation of the
blood; innocent, artful, roguish, prim, gushing, ignorant, and
miraculously wise. Their ages were sixteen and fifteen; it is an epoch
when, if one is frank, one must admit that one has nothing to learn:
one has learnt simply everything in the previous six months.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) goes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sophia.

<p/>Up the Square, from the corner of King Street, passed a woman in a new
bonnet with pink strings, and a new blue dress that sloped at the
shoulders and grew to a vast circumference at the hem. Through the
silent sunlit solitude of the Square -LRB-for it was Thursday afternoon,
and all the shops shut except the confectioner's and one chemist's-RRB-
this bonnet and this dress floated northwards in search of romance,
under the relentless eyes of Constance and Sophia. Within them,
somewhere, was the soul of Maggie, domestic servant at Baines's. Maggie
had been at the shop since before the creation of Constance and Sophia.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lived seventeen hours of each day in an underground kitchen and
larder, and the other seven in an attic, never going out except to
chapel on Sunday evenings, and once a month on Thursday afternoons.
<div class="bookquote">``Followers''  (<font color='red'><b>an aunt</b></font>)</div>were most strictly forbidden to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); but on rare occasions
an aunt from Longshaw was permitted as a tremendous favour to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
in the subterranean den. Everybody, including herself, considered that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a good <div class="bookquote">``place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and was well treated. It was undeniable, for
instance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was allowed to fall in love exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chose,
provided she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not <div class="bookquote">``carry on''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in the kitchen or the yard. And as a
fact, Maggie had fallen in love. In seventeen years she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been
engaged eleven times. No one could conceive how that ugly and powerful
organism could softly languish to the undoing of even a butty-collier,
nor why, having caught a man in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sweet toils, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could ever be
imbecile enough to set him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free. There are, however, mysteries in the
souls of Maggies. The drudge had probably been affianced oftener than
any woman in Bursley. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) employers were so accustomed to an
interesting announcement that for years they had taken to saying naught
in reply but <div class="bookquote">``Really, Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>employers</b></font>)</div>Engagements and tragic partings were
Maggie's pastime. Fixed otherwise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have studied the piano
instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No gloves, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia criticized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can't expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to have gloves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>Then a pause, as the bonnet and dress neared the top of the Square.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turns round and sees us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with a haughtiness almost
impassioned; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head trembled slightly.

<p/>There were, as usual, several loafers at the top of the Square, in the
corner between the bank and the <div class="bookquote">``Marquis of Granby.''  (<font color='red'><b>loafers</b></font>)</div>And one of these
loafers stepped forward and shook hands with an obviously willing
Maggie. Clearly it was a rendezvous, open, unashamed. The twelfth
victim had been selected by the virgin of forty, whose kiss would not
have melted lard! The couple disappeared together down Oldcastle Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WELL!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>While Sophia, short of adequate words, flushed and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lip.

<p/>With the profound, instinctive cruelty of youth, Constance and Sophia
had assembled in their favourite haunt, the show-room, expressly to
deride Maggie in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) new clothes. They obscurely thought that a woman
so ugly and soiled as Maggie was had no right to possess new clothes.
Even her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) desire to take the air of a Thursday afternoon seemed to them
unnatural and somewhat reprehensible. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) want to stir out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kitchen? As for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tender yearnings, they positively grudged
these to Maggie. That Maggie should give rein to chaste passion was
more than grotesque; it was offensive and wicked. But let it not for an
instant be doubted that they were nice, kind-hearted, well-behaved, and
delightful girls! Because they were. They were not angels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too ridiculous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, severely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had youth, beauty,
and rank in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) favour. And to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) it really was ridiculous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured. Constance was foolishly
good-natured, a perfect manufactory of excuses for other people; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) benevolence was eternally rising up and overpowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reason.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time did mother say she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should be back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not until supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Hallelujah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia burst out, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hands in joy. And they
both slid down from the counter just as if they had been little boys,
and not, as their mother called them, <div class="bookquote">``great girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go and play the Osborne quadrilles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia suggested -LRB-the
Osborne quadrilles being a series of dances arranged to be performed on
drawing-room pianos by four jewelled hands-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, with a precocious gesture of
seriousness. In that gesture, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone, was something which
conveyed to Sophia: <div class="bookquote">``Sophia, how can you be so utterly blind to the
gravity of our fleeting existence as to ask me to go and strum the
piano with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div>Yet a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been a little boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never have another chance like to-day for getting on with
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, picking up a bag from the counter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat down and took from the bag a piece of loosely woven canvas, on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was embroidering a bunch of roses in coloured wools. The
canvas had once been stretched on a frame, but now, as the delicate
labour of the petals and leaves was done, and nothing remained to do
but the monotonous background, Constance was content to pin the stuff
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knee. With the long needle and several skeins of mustard-tinted
wool, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bent over the canvas and resumed the filling-in of the tiny
squares. The whole design was in squares--the gradations of red and
greens, the curves of the smallest buds--all was contrived in squares,
with a result that mimicked a fragment of uncompromising Axminster
carpet. Still, the fine texture of the wool, the regular and rapid
grace of those fingers moving incessantly at back and front of the
canvas, the gentle sound of the wool as it passed through the holes,
and the intent, youthful earnestness of that lowered gaze, excused and
invested with charm an activity which, on artistic grounds, could not
possibly be justified. The canvas was destined to adorn a gilt
firescreen in the drawing-room, and also to form a birthday gift to
Mrs. Baines from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) elder daughter. But whether the enterprise was as
secret from Mrs. Baines as Constance hoped, none save Mrs. Baines knew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Con,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``you're too sickening sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, blandly, <div class="bookquote">``it's no use pretending that this
hasn't got to be finished before we go back to school, because it has.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Sophia wandered about, a prey ripe for the Evil One. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
exclaimed joyously--even ecstatically--looking behind the cheval glass,
<div class="bookquote">``here's mother's new skirt! Miss Dunn's been putting the gimp on it!
Oh, mother, what a proud thing you will be!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Constance heard swishings
behind the glass. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, Sophia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You surely aren't putting that skirt on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll catch it finely, I can tell you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Without further defence, Sophia sprang out from behind the immense
glass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had already shed a notable part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own costume, and the
flush of mischief was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ran across to the other side of
the room and examined carefully a large coloured print that was affixed
to the wall.

<p/>This print represented fifteen sisters, all of the same height and
slimness of figure, all of the same age--about twenty-five or so, and
all with exactly the same haughty and bored beauty. That they were in
truth sisters was clear from the facial resemblance between them; their
demeanour indicated that they were princesses, offspring of some
impossibly prolific king and queen. Those hands had never toiled, nor
had those features ever relaxed from the smile of courts. The
princesses moved in a landscape of marble steps and verandahs, with a
bandstand and strange trees in the distance. One was in a riding-habit,
another in evening attire, another dressed for tea, another for the
theatre; another seemed to be ready to go to bed. One held a little
girl by the hand; it could not have been her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own little girl, for these
princesses were far beyond human passions. Where had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) obtained the
little girl? Why was one sister going to the theatre, another to tea,
another to the stable, and another to bed? Why was one in a heavy
mantle, and another sheltering from the sun's rays under a parasol? The
picture was drenched in mystery, and the strangest thing about it was
that all these highnesses were apparently content with the most
ridiculous and out-moded fashions. Absurd hats, with veils flying
behind; absurd bonnets, fitting close to the head, and spotted; absurd
coiffures that nearly lay on the nape; absurd, clumsy sleeves; absurd
waists, almost above the elbow's level; absurd scolloped jackets! And
the skirts! What a sight were those skirts! They were nothing but vast
decorated pyramids; on the summit of each was stuck the upper half of a
princess. It was astounding that princesses should consent to be so
preposterous and so uncomfortable. But Sophia perceived nothing uncanny
in the picture, which bore the legend: <div class="bookquote">``Newest summer fashions from
Paris. Gratis supplement to Myra's Journal.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia had never imagined
anything more stylish, lovely, and dashing than the raiment of the
fifteen princesses.

<p/>For Constance and Sophia had the disadvantage of living in the middle
ages. The crinoline had not quite reached its full circumference, and
the dress-improver had not even been thought of. In all the Five Towns
there was not a public bath, nor a free library, nor a municipal park,
nor a telephone, nor yet a board-school. People had not understood the
vital necessity of going away to the seaside every year. Bishop Colenso
had just staggered Christianity by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) shameless notions on the
Pentateuch. Half Lancashire was starving on account of the American
war. Garroting was the chief amusement of the homicidal classes.
Incredible as it may appear, there was nothing but a horse-tram running
between Bursley and Hanbridge--and that only twice an hour; and between
the other towns no stage of any kind! One went to Longshaw as one now
goes to Pekin. It was an era so dark and backward that one might wonder
how people could sleep in their beds at night for thinking about their
sad state.

<p/>Happily the inhabitants of the Five Towns in that era were passably
pleased with themselves, and they never even suspected that they were
not quite modern and quite awake. They thought that the intellectual,
the industrial, and the social movements had gone about as far as these
movements could go, and they were amazed at their own progress. Instead
of being humble and ashamed, they actually showed pride in their
pitiful achievements. They ought to have looked forward meekly to the
prodigious feats of posterity; but, having too little faith and too
much conceit, they were content to look behind and make comparisons
with the past. They did not foresee the miraculous generation which is
us. A poor, blind, complacent people! The ludicrous horse-car was
typical of them. The driver rang a huge bell, five minutes before
starting, that could be heard from the Wesleyan Chapel to the Cock
Yard, and then after deliberations and hesitations the vehicle rolled
off on its rails into unknown dangers while passengers shouted
good-bye. At Bleakridge it had to stop for the turnpike, and it was
assisted up the mountains of Leveson Place and Sutherland Street
-LRB-towards Hanbridge-RRB- by a third horse, on whose back was perched a tiny,
whip-cracking boy; that boy lived like a shuttle on the road between
Leveson Place and Sutherland Street, and even in wet weather he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutherland</b></font>) was the
envy of all other boys. After half an hour's perilous transit the car
drew up solemnly in a narrow street by the Signal office in Hanbridge,
and the ruddy driver, having revolved many times the polished iron
handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) sole brake, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) passengers in
calm triumph, dismissing them with a sort of unsung doxology.

<p/>And this was regarded as the last word of traction! A whip-cracking boy
on a tip horse! Oh, blind, blind! You could not foresee the hundred and
twenty electric cars that now rush madly bumping and thundering at
twenty miles an hour through all the main streets of the district!

<p/>So that naturally Sophia, infected with the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) period, had no
misgivings whatever concerning the final elegance of the princesses.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) studied them as the fifteen apostles of the ne plus ultra; then,
having taken some flowers and plumes out of a box, amid warnings from
Constance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) retreated behind the glass, and presently emerged as a
great lady in the style of the princesses. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's tremendous new
gown ballooned about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in all its fantastic richness and
expensiveness. And with the gown she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's
importance--that mien of assured authority, of capacity tested in many
a crisis, which characterized Mrs. Baines, and which Mrs. Baines seemed
to impart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) dresses even before she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had regularly worn them. For
it was a fact that Mrs. Baines's empty garments inspired respect, as
though some essence had escaped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) and remained in them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance stayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) needle, and, without lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head, gazed, with
eyes raised from the wool-work, motionless at the posturing figure of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sister. It was sacrilege that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was witnessing, a prodigious
irreverence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was conscious of an expectation that punishment would
instantly fall on this daring, impious child. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), who never felt
these mad, amazing impulses, could nevertheless only smile fearfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) breathed, with an intensity of alarm that merged into
condoning admiration. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever will you do next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia's lovely flushed face crowned the extraordinary structure like a
blossom, scarcely controlling its laughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was as tall as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mother, and as imperious, as crested, and proud; and in spite of the
pigtail, the girlish semi-circular comb, and the loose foal-like limbs,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could support as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother the majesty of the
gimp-embroidered dress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes sparkled with all the challenges of
the untried virgin as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) minced about the showroom. Abounding life
inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) movements. The confident and fierce joy of youth shone on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brow. <div class="bookquote">``What thing on earth equals me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seemed to demand with
enchanting and yet ruthless arrogance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the daughter of a
respected, bedridden draper in an insignificant town, lost in the
central labyrinth of England, if you like; yet what manner of man,
confronted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), would or could have denied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) naive claim to
dominion? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stood, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's hoops, for the desire of the
world. And in the innocence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soul she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew it! The heart of a
young girl mysteriously speaks and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) power long ere she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
can use her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) power. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can find nothing else to subdue, you may
catch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the early years subduing a gate-post or drawing homage
from an empty chair. Sophia's experimental victim was Constance, with
suspended needle and soft glance that shot out from the lowered face.

<p/>Then Sophia fell, in stepping backwards; the pyramid was overbalanced;
great distended rings of silk trembled and swayed gigantically on the
floor, and Sophia's small feet lay like the feet of a doll on the rim
of the largest circle, which curved and arched above them like a
cavern's mouth. The abrupt transition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) features from assured
pride to ludicrous astonishment and alarm was comical enough to have
sent into wild uncharitable laughter any creature less humane than
Constance. But Constance sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), a single embodied instinct of
benevolence, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) snub nose, and tried to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cried compassionately--that voice seemed not to know
the tones of reproof--<div class="bookquote">``I do hope you've not messed it, because mother
would be so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were interrupted by the sound of groans beyond the door
leading to the bedrooms. The groans, indicating direst physical
torment, grew louder. The two girls stared, wonder-struck and afraid,
at the door, Sophia with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dark head raised, and Constance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
arms round Sophia's waist. The door opened, letting in a much-magnified
sound of groans, and there entered a youngish, undersized man, who was
frantically clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and contorting all the
muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. On perceiving the sculptural group of two prone,
interlocked girls, one enveloped in a crinoline, and the other with a
wool-work bunch of flowers pinned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knee, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped back, ceased
groaning, arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and seriously tried to pretend that it was
not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had been vocal in anguish, that, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just passing
as a casual, ordinary wayfarer through the showroom to the shop below.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blushed darkly; and the girls also blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I beg pardon, I'm sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>said this youngish man suddenly; and with
a swift turn he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappeared whence he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Mr. Povey, a person universally esteemed, both within and
without the shop, the surrogate of bedridden Mr. Baines, the unfailing
comfort and stand-by of Mrs. Baines, the fount and radiating centre of
order and discipline in the shop; a quiet, diffident, secretive,
tedious, and obstinate youngish man, absolutely faithful, absolutely
efficient in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sphere; without brilliance, without distinction;
perhaps rather little-minded, certainly narrow-minded; but what a force
in the shop! The shop was inconceivable without Mr. Povey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was under
twenty and not out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) apprenticeship when Mr. Baines had been
struck down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had at once proved his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) worth. Of the assistants, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
alone slept in the house. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bedroom was next to that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) employer;
there was a door between the two chambers, and the two steps led down
from the larger to the less.

<p/>The girls regained their feet, Sophia with Constance's help. It was not
easy to right a capsized crinoline. They both began to laugh nervously,
with a trace of hysteria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d gone to the dentist's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>whispered Constance.

<p/>Mr. Povey's toothache had been causing anxiety in the microcosm for two
days, and it had been clearly understood at dinner that Thursday
morning that Mr. Povey was to set forth to Oulsnam Bros., the dentists
at Hillport, without any delay. Only on Thursdays and Sundays did Mr.
Povey dine with the family. On other days he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dined later, by himself,
but at the family table, when Mrs. Baines or one of the assistants
could <div class="bookquote">``relieve''  (<font color='red'><b>the assistants</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) in the shop. Before starting out to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) elder
sister at Axe, Mrs. Baines had insisted to Mr. Povey that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had eaten
practically nothing but <div class="bookquote">``slops''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for twenty-four hours, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
was not careful she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had replied in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
quietest, most sagacious, matter-of-fact tone--the tone that carried
weight with all who heard it--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had only been waiting for
Thursday afternoon, and should of course go instantly to Oulsnams' and
have the thing attended to in a proper manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had even added that
persons who put off going to the dentist's were simply sowing trouble
for themselves.

<p/>None could possibly have guessed that Mr. Povey was afraid of going to
the dentist's. But such was the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had not dared to set forth.
The paragon of commonsense, pictured by most people as being somehow
unliable to human frailties, could not yet screw himself up to the
point of ringing a dentist's door-bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did look funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought. I couldn't
help laughing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance made no answer; but when Sophia had resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own clothes,
and it was ascertained beyond doubt that the new dress had not
suffered, and Constance herself was calmly stitching again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said,
poising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) needle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had poised it to watch Sophia:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just wondering whether something oughtn't to be done for Mr.
Povey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) bedroom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go and listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia the adventuress.

<p/>They went, through the showroom door, past the foot of the stairs
leading to the second storey, down the long corridor broken in the
middle by two steps and carpeted with a narrow bordered carpet whose
parallel lines increased its apparent length. They went on tiptoe,
sticking close to one another. Mr. Povey's door was slightly ajar. They
listened; not a sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Povey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance coughed discreetly.

<p/>No reply. It was Sophia who pushed the door open. Constance made an
elderly prim plucking gesture at Sophia's bare arm, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) followed
Sophia gingerly into the forbidden room, which was, however, empty. The
bed had been ruffled, and on it lay a book, <div class="bookquote">``The Harvest of a Quiet
Eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harvest of a quiet tooth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia whispered, giggling very low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hsh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips forward.

<p/>From the next room came a regular, muffled, oratorical sound, as though
some one had begun many years ago to address a meeting and had
forgotten to leave off and never would leave off. They were familiar
with the sound, and they quitted Mr. Povey's chamber in fear of
disturbing it. At the same moment Mr. Povey reappeared, this time in
the drawing-room doorway at the other extremity of the long corridor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) seemed to be trying ineffectually to flee from his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) tooth as a
murderer tries to flee from his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) conscience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Povey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance quickly--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had surprised them
coming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) bedroom; <div class="bookquote">``we were just looking for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see if we could do anything for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) began to come down the corridor, slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't been to the dentist's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, as if Constance was indicating a fact
which had escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) attention. <div class="bookquote">``The truth is, I thought it looked
like rain, and if I'd got wet--you see--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miserable Mr. Povey!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, <div class="bookquote">``you certainly ought to keep out of draughts.
Don't you think it would be a good thing if you went and sat in the
parlour? There's a fire there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be all right, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. And after a pause:
<div class="bookquote">``Well, thanks, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div><p/>III

<p/>The girls made way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) to pass them at the head of the twisting
stairs which led down to the parlour. Constance followed, and Sophia
followed Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have father's chair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>There were two rocking-chairs with fluted backs covered by
antimacassars, one on either side of the hearth. That to the left was
still entitled <div class="bookquote">``father's chair,''  (<font color='red'><b>owner</b></font>)</div>though its owner had not sat in it
since long before the Crimean war, and would never sit in it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'd sooner have the other one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, <div class="bookquote">``because it's
on the right side, you see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) right cheek.

<p/>Having taken Mrs. Baines's chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) face down to the fire,
seeking comfort from its warmth. Sophia poked the fire, whereupon Mr.
Povey abruptly withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) then felt something light on his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
shoulders. Constance had taken the antimacassar from the back of the
chair, and protected him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) with it from the draughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) did not
instantly rebel, and therefore was permanently barred from rebellion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was entrapped by the antimacassar. It formally constituted him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) an
invalid, and Constance and Sophia his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) nurses. Constance drew the
curtain across the street door. No draught could come from the window,
for the window was not `made to open.'' The age of ventilation had not
arrived. Sophia shut the other two doors. And, each near a door, the
girls gazed at Mr. Povey behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) back, irresolute, but filled with a
delicious sense of responsibility.

<p/>The situation was on a different plane now. The seriousness of Mr.
Povey's toothache, which became more and more manifest, had already
wiped out the ludicrous memory of the encounter in the showroom.
Looking at these two big girls, with their short-sleeved black frocks
and black aprons, and their smooth hair, and their composed serious
faces, one would have judged them incapable of the least lapse from an
archangelic primness; Sophia especially presented a marvellous
imitation of saintly innocence. As for the toothache, its action on Mr.
Povey was apparently periodic; it gathered to a crisis like a wave,
gradually, the torture increasing till the wave broke and left Mr.
Povey exhausted, but free for a moment from pain. These crises recurred
about once a minute. And now, accustomed to the presence of the young
virgins, and having tacitly acknowledged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) acceptance of the
antimacassar that his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) state was abnormal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) gave himself up frankly to
affliction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) concealed nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) agony, which was fully
displayed by sudden contortions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) frame, and frantic oscillations
of the rocking-chair. Presently, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lay back enfeebled in the wash
of a spent wave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) murmured with a sick man's voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you haven't got any laudanum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>The girls started into life. <div class="bookquote">``Laudanum, Mr. Povey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to hold in my mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) sat up, tense; another wave was forming. The excellent fellow was
lost to all self-respect, all decency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's sure to be some in mother's cupboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>Constance, who bore Mrs. Baines's bunch of keys at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) girdle, a solemn
trust, moved a little fearfully to a corner cupboard which was hung in
the angle to the right of the projecting fireplace, over a shelf on
which stood a large copper tea-urn. That corner cupboard, of oak inlaid
with maple and ebony in a simple border pattern, was typical of the
room. It was of a piece with the deep green <div class="bookquote">``flock''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>wall paper, and the
tea-urn, and the rocking-chairs with their antimacassars, and the
harmonium in rosewood with a Chinese paper-mache tea-caddy on the top
of it; even with the carpet, certainly the most curious parlour carpet
that ever was, being made of lengths of the stair-carpet sewn together
side by side. That corner cupboard was already old in service; it had
held the medicines of generations. It gleamed darkly with the grave and
genuine polish which comes from ancient use alone. The key which
Constance chose from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bunch was like the cupboard, smooth and
shining with years; it fitted and turned very easily, yet with a firm
snap. The single wide door opened sedately as a portal.

<p/>The girls examined the sacred interior, which had the air of being
inhabited by an army of diminutive prisoners, each crying aloud with
the full strength of its label to be set free on a mission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia eagerly.

<p/>And there it was: a blue bottle, with a saffron label, <div class="bookquote">``Caution.
POISON. Laudanum. Charles Critchlow, M.P.S. Dispensing Chemist. St.
Luke's Square, Bursley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Those large capitals frightened the girls. Constance took the bottle as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have taken a loaded revolver, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glanced at Sophia.
Their omnipotent, all-wise mother was not present to tell them what to
do. They, who had never decided, had to decide now. And Constance was
the elder. Must this fearsome stuff, whose very name was a name of
fear, be introduced in spite of printed warnings into Mr. Povey's
mouth? The responsibility was terrifying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I'd just better ask Mr. Critchlow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance faltered.

<p/>The expectation of beneficent laudanum had enlivened Mr. Povey, had
already, indeed, by a sort of suggestion, half cured his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) toothache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``No need to ask Mr. Critchlow ... Two or three drops
in a little water.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) showed impatience to be at the laudanum.

<p/>The girls knew that an antipathy existed between the chemist and Mr.
Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's sure to be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get the water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance</b></font>)</div><p/>With youthful cries and alarms they succeeded in pouring four mortal
dark drops -LRB-one more than Constance intended-RRB- into a cup containing a
little water. And as they handed the cup to Mr. Povey their faces were
the faces of affrighted comical conspirators. They felt so old and they
looked so young.

<p/>Mr. Povey imbibed eagerly of the potion, put the cup on the
mantelpiece, and then tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) head to the right so as to submerge
the affected tooth. In this posture he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) remained, awaiting the sweet
influence of the remedy. The girls, out of a nice modesty, turned away,
for Mr. Povey must not swallow the medicine, and they preferred to
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) unhampered in the solution of a delicate problem. When next
they examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was leaning back in the rocking-chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
mouth open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) eyes shut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it done you any good, Mr. Povey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll lie down on the sofa for a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Povey's
strange reply; and forthwith he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) sprang up and flung himself on to the
horse-hair sofa between the fireplace and the window, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lay
stripped of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dignity, a mere beaten animal in a grey suit with
peculiar coat-tails, and a very creased waistcoat, and a lapel that was
planted with pins, and a paper collar and close-fitting paper cuffs.

<p/>Constance ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) with the antimacassar, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) spread softly
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) shoulders; and Sophia put another one over his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) thin little legs,
all drawn up.

<p/>They then gazed at their handiwork, with secret self-accusations and
the most dreadful misgivings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) surely never swallowed it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)'s asleep, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, more loudly.

<p/>Mr. Povey was certainly asleep, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mouth was very wide open--like
a shop-door. The only question was whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) sleep was not an eternal
sleep; the only question was whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was not out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) pain for
ever.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) snored--horribly; his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) snore seemed a portent of disaster.

<p/>Sophia approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) were a bomb, and stared, growing
bolder, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Con,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``do come and look! It's too droll!''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>In an instant all their four eyes were exploring the singular landscape
of Mr. Povey's mouth. In a corner, to the right of that interior, was
one sizeable fragment of a tooth, that was attached to Mr. Povey by the
slenderest tie, so that at each respiration of Mr. Povey, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) body
slightly heaved and the gale moaned in the cavern, this tooth moved
separately, showing that its long connection with Mr. Povey was drawing
to a close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, pointing. <div class="bookquote">``And it's as loose as
anything. Did you ever see such a funny thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div><p/>The extreme funniness of the thing had lulled in Sophia the fear of Mr.
Povey's sudden death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)'s taken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, preoccupied, going to
the mantelpiece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I do believe--''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia began, and then stopped, glancing at the
sewing-machine, which stood next to the sofa.

<p/>It was a Howe sewing-machine. It had a little tool-drawer, and in the
tool-drawer was a small pair of pliers. Constance, engaged in sniffing
at the lees of the potion in order to estimate its probable deadliness,
heard the well-known click of the little tool-drawer, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw
Sophia nearing Mr. Povey's mouth with the pliers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed, aghast. <div class="bookquote">``What in the name of goodness are you
doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>The next instant Mr. Povey sprang up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) laudanum dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It jumps!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) muttered; and, after a reflective pause, <div class="bookquote">``but it's much
better.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had at any rate escaped death.

<p/>Sophia's right hand was behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) back.

<p/>Just then a hawker passed down King Street, crying mussels and cockles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia almost shrieked. <div class="bookquote">``Do let's have mussels and cockles for
tea!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rushed to the door, and unlocked and opened it,
regardless of the risk of draughts to Mr. Povey.

<p/>In those days people often depended upon the caprices of hawkers for
the tastiness of their teas; but it was an adventurous age, when errant
knights of commerce were numerous and enterprising. You went on to your
doorstep, caught your meal as it passed, withdrew, cooked it and ate
it, quite in the manner of the early Briton.

<p/>Constance was obliged to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister on the top step. Sophia
descended to the second step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fresh mussels and cockles all alive oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the hawker</b></font>)</div>bawled the hawker, looking
across the road in the April breeze. He (<font color='blue'><b>hawker</b></font>) was the celebrated Hollins, a
professional Irish drunkard, aged in iniquity, who cheerfully saluted
magistrates in the street, and referred to the workhouse, which he (<font color='blue'><b>hawker</b></font>)
occasionally visited, as the Bastile.

<p/>Sophia was trembling from head to foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What ARE you laughing at, you silly thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance demanded.

<p/>Sophia surreptitiously showed the pliers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had partly thrust
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pocket. Between their points was a most perceptible, and even
recognizable, fragment of Mr. Povey.

<p/>This was the crown of Sophia's career as a perpetrator of the
unutterable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance's face showed the final contortions of that horrified
incredulity which is forced to believe.

<p/>Sophia nudged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) violently to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that they were in the street,
and also quite close to Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my little missies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hollins/Mrs. Hollins</b></font>)</div>said the vile Hollins. <div class="bookquote">``Three pence a pint,
and how's your honoured mother to-day? Yes, fresh, so help me God!''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>THE TOOTH

<p/>I


<p/>The two girls came up the unlighted stone staircase which led from
Maggie's cave to the door of the parlour. Sophia, foremost, was
carrying a large tray, and Constance a small one. Constance, who had
nothing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tray but a teapot, a bowl of steaming and balmy-scented
mussels and cockles, and a plate of hot buttered toast, went directly
into the parlour on the left. Sophia had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arms the entire
material and apparatus of a high tea for two, including eggs, jam, and
toast -LRB-covered with the slop-basin turned upside down-RRB-, but not
including mussels and cockles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned to the right, passed along
the corridor by the cutting-out room, up two steps into the sheeted and
shuttered gloom of the closed shop, up the showroom stairs, through the
showroom, and so into the bedroom corridor. Experience had proved it
easier to make this long detour than to round the difficult corner of
the parlour stairs with a large loaded tray. Sophia knocked with the
edge of the tray at the door of the principal bedroom. The muffled
oratorical sound from within suddenly ceased, and the door was opened
by a very tall, very thin, black-bearded man, who looked down at Sophia
as if to demand what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) meant by such an interruption.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've brought the tea, Mr. Critchlow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>And Mr. Critchlow carefully accepted the tray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that my little Sophia?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked a faint voice from the depths of the
bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not attempt to enter the room. Mr. Critchlow put the tray
on a white-clad chest of drawers near the door, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) shut the
door, with no ceremony. Mr. Critchlow was John Baines's oldest and
closest friend, though decidedly younger than the draper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) frequently
<div class="bookquote">``popped in''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to have a word with the invalid; but Thursday afternoon was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) special afternoon, consecrated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) to the service of the sick.
From two o'clock precisely till eight o'clock precisely he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) took charge
of John Baines, reigning autocratically over the bedroom. It was known
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would not tolerate invasions, nor even ambassadorial visits.
No! He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) weekly holiday to this business of friendship, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) must be allowed to conduct the business in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own way. Mrs. Baines
herself avoided disturbing Mr. Critchlow's ministrations on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was glad to do so; for Mr. Baines was never to be left
alone under any circumstances, and the convenience of being able to
rely upon the presence of a staid member of the Pharmaceutical Society
for six hours of a given day every week outweighed the slight affront
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) prerogatives as wife and house-mistress. Mr. Critchlow was an
extremely peculiar man, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was in the bedroom she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could leave
the house with an easy mind. Moreover, John Baines enjoyed these
Thursday afternoons. For him (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), there was `none like Charles Critchlow.''
The two old friends experienced a sort of grim, desiccated happiness,
cooped up together in the bedroom, secure from women and fools
generally. How they spent the time did not seem to be certainly known,
but the impression was that politics occupied them. Undoubtedly Mr.
Critchlow was an extremely peculiar man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was a man of habits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
must always have the same things for his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) tea. Black-currant jam, for
instance. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) called it ``preserve.<div class="bookquote">''-RRB- The idea of offering Mr. Critchlow
a tea which did not comprise black-currant jam was inconceivable by the
intelligence of St. Luke's Square. Thus for years past, in the
fruit-preserving season, when all the house and all the shop smelt
richly of fruit boiling in sugar, Mrs. Baines had filled an extra
number of jars with black-currant jam, `because Mr. Critchlow wouldn't
TOUCH any other sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>So Sophia, faced with the shut door of the bedroom, went down to the
parlour by the shorter route. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that on going up again, after
tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would find the devastated tray on the doormat.

<p/>Constance was helping Mr. Povey to mussels and cockles. And Mr. Povey
still wore one of the antimacassars. It must have stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
shoulders when he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) sprang up from the sofa, woollen antimacassars being
notoriously parasitic things. Sophia sat down, somewhat
self-consciously. The serious Constance was also perturbed. Mr. Povey
did not usually take tea in the house on Thursday afternoons; his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
practice was to go out into the great, mysterious world. Never before
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) shared a meal with the girls alone. The situation was
indubitably unexpected, unforeseen; it was, too, piquant, and what
added to its piquancy was the fact that Constance and Sophia were,
somehow, responsible for Mr. Povey. They felt that they were
responsible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). They had offered the practical sympathy of two
intelligent and well-trained young women, born nurses by reason of
their sex, and Mr. Povey had accepted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was now on their hands.
Sophia's monstrous, sly operation in Mr. Povey's mouth did not cause
either of them much alarm, Constance having apparently recovered from
the first shock of it. They had discussed it in the kitchen while
preparing the teas; Constance's extraordinarily severe and dictatorial
tone in condemning it had led to a certain heat. But the success of the
impudent wrench justified it despite any irrefutable argument to the
contrary. Mr. Povey was better already, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) evidently remained in
ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have some?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked of Sophia, with a large spoon hovering
over the bowl of shells.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, PLEASE,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, positively.

<p/>Constance well knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have some, and had only asked from
sheer nervousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pass your plate, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Now when everybody was served with mussels, cockles, tea, and toast,
and Mr. Povey had been persuaded to cut the crust off his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) toast, and
Constance had, quite unnecessarily, warned Sophia against the deadly
green stuff in the mussels, and Constance had further pointed out that
the evenings were getting longer, and Mr. Povey had agreed that they
were, there remained nothing to say. An irksome silence fell on them
all, and no one could lift it off. Tiny clashes of shell and crockery
sounded with the terrible clearness of noises heard in the night. Each
person avoided the eyes of the others. And both Constance and Sophia
kept straightening their bodies at intervals, and expanding their
chests, and then looking at their plates; occasionally a prim cough was
discharged. It was a sad example of the difference between young
women's dreams of social brilliance and the reality of life. These
girls got more and more girlish, until, from being women at the
administering of laudanum, they sank back to about eight years of
age--perfect children--at the tea-table.

<p/>The tension was snapped by Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) muttered, moved by a
startling discovery to this impious and disgraceful oath -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), the
pattern and exemplar--and in the presence of innocent girlhood too!-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``I've swallowed it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Swallowed what, Mr. Povey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance inquired.

<p/>The tip of Mr. Povey's tongue made a careful voyage of inspection all
round the right side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, as if solemnly accepting the inevitable. <div class="bookquote">``I've
swallowed it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia's face was now scarlet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seemed to be looking for some place
to hide it. Constance could not think of anything to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That tooth has been loose for two years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, <div class="bookquote">``and now
I've swallowed it with a mussel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Povey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance cried in confusion, and added, <div class="bookquote">``There's one
good thing, it can't hurt you any more now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't THAT tooth that was hurting me. It's
an old stump at the back that's upset me so this last day or two. I
wish it had been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) teacup close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) red face. At these words of Mr.
Povey her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cheeks seemed to fill out like plump apples. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dashed the
cup into its saucer, spilling tea recklessly, and then ran from the
room with stifled snorts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must just--''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia incoherently spluttered in the doorway. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall be all right. Don't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance, who had risen, sat down again.

<p/>II

<p/>Sophia fled along the passage leading to the shop and took refuge in
the cutting-out room, a room which the astonishing architect had
devised upon what must have been a backyard of one of the three
constituent houses. It was lighted from its roof, and only a wooden
partition, eight feet high, separated it from the passage. Here Sophia
gave rein to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) laughed and cried together, weeping
generously into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) handkerchief and wildly giggling, in a hysteria
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not control. The spectacle of Mr. Povey mourning for a
tooth which he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had swallowed, but which in fact lay all the
time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pocket, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to be by far the most ridiculous,
side-splitting thing that had ever happened or could happen on earth.
It utterly overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had exhausted
and conquered its surpassing ridiculousness, this ridiculousness seized
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again and rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) anew in depths of mad, trembling laughter.

<p/>Gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grew calmer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard the parlour door open, and
Constance descend the kitchen steps with a rattling tray of tea-things.
Tea, then, was finished, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! Constance did not remain in the
kitchen, because the cups and saucers were left for Maggie to wash up
as a fitting coda to Maggie's monthly holiday. The parlour door closed.
And the vision of Mr. Povey in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) antimacassar swept Sophia off into
another convulsion of laughter and tears. Upon this the parlour door
opened again, and Sophia choked herself into silence while Constance
hastened along the passage. In a minute Constance returned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
woolwork, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had got from the showroom, and the parlour received
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Not the least curiosity on the part of Constance as to what had
become of Sophia!

<p/>At length Sophia, a faint meditative smile being all that was left of
the storm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), ascended slowly to the showroom, through the shop.
Nothing there of interest! Thence she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wandered towards the
drawing-room, and encountered Mr. Critchlow's tray on the mat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
picked it up and carried it by way of the showroom and shop down to the
kitchen, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dreamily munched two pieces of toast that had cooled
to the consistency of leather. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mounted the stone steps and listened
at the door of the parlour. No sound! This seclusion of Mr. Povey and
Constance was really very strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) roved right round the house, and
descended creepingly by the twisted house-stairs, and listened intently
at the other door of the parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) now detected a faint regular
snore. Mr. Povey, a prey to laudanum and mussels, was sleeping while
Constance worked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fire-screen! It was now in the highest degree
odd, this seclusion of Mr. Povey and Constance; unlike anything in
Sophia's experience! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to go into the parlour, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
not bring herself to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) crept away again, forlorn and puzzled,
and next discovered herself in the bedroom which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shared with
Constance at the top of the house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lay down in the dusk on the bed
and began to read <div class="bookquote">``The Days of Bruce;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) read only with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard movements on the house-stairs, and the familiar
whining creak of the door at the foot thereof. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) skipped lightly to
the door of the bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mr. Povey. I hope you'll be able to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance's voice!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will probably come on again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Povey's voice, pessimistic!

<p/>Then the shutting of doors. It was almost dark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went back to the
bed, expecting a visit from Constance. But a clock struck eight, and
all the various phenomena connected with the departure of Mr. Critchlow
occurred one after another. At the same time Maggie came home from the
land of romance. Then long silences! Constance was now immured with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father, it being her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``turn''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>to nurse; Maggie was washing up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
cave, and Mr. Povey was lost to sight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) bedroom. Then Sophia heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's lively, commanding knock on the King Street door. Dusk had
definitely yielded to black night in the bedroom. Sophia dozed and
dreamed. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) awoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ear caught the sound of knocking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
jumped up, tiptoed to the landing, and looked over the balustrade,
whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a view of all the first-floor corridor. The gas had been
lighted; through the round aperture at the top of the porcelain globe
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could see the wavering flame. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother, still bonneted,
who was knocking at the door of Mr. Povey's room. Constance stood in
the doorway of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) parents' room. Mrs. Baines knocked twice with an
interval, and then said to Constance, in a resonant whisper that
vibrated up the corridor--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) seems to be fast asleep. I'd better not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wants something in the night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, child, I should hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) moving. Sleep's the best thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines left Mr. Povey to the effects of laudanum, and came along
the corridor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was a stout woman, all black stuff and gold chain,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) skirt more than filled the width of the corridor. Sophia
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) habitual heavy mounting gesture as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) climbed the two
steps that gave variety to the corridor. At the gas-jet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paused,
and, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand to the tap, gazed up into the globe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Sophia?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demanded, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes fixed on the gas as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
lowered the flame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must be in bed, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, nonchalantly.

<p/>The returned mistress was point by point resuming knowledge and control
of that complicated machine--her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) household.

<p/>Then Constance and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mother disappeared into the bedroom, and the
door was shut with a gentle, decisive bang that to the silent watcher
on the floor above seemed to create a special excluding intimacy round
about the figures of Constance and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father and mother. The watcher
wondered, with a little prick of jealousy, what they would be
discussing in the large bedroom, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father's beard wagging feebly and
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) long arms on the counterpane, Constance perched at the foot of the
bed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mother walking to and fro, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cameo brooch on the
dressing-table or stretching creases out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) gloves. Certainly, in
some subtle way, Constance had a standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) parents which was
more confidential than Sophia's.

<p/>III

<p/>When Constance came to bed, half an hour later, Sophia was already in
bed. The room was fairly spacious. It had been the girls' retreat and
fortress since their earliest years. Its features seemed to them as
natural and unalterable as the features of a cave to a cave-dweller. It
had been repapered twice in their lives, and each papering stood out in
their memories like an epoch; a third epoch was due to the replacing of
a drugget by a resplendent old carpet degraded from the drawing-room.
There was only one bed, the bedstead being of painted iron; they never
interfered with each other in that bed, sleeping with a detachment as
perfect as if they had slept on opposite sides of St. Luke's Square;
yet if Constance had one night lain down on the half near the window
instead of on the half near the door, the secret nature of the universe
would have seemed to be altered. The small fire-grate was filled with a
mass of shavings of silver paper; now the rare illnesses which they had
suffered were recalled chiefly as periods when that silver paper was
crammed into a large slipper-case which hung by the mantelpiece, and a
fire of coals unnaturally reigned in its place--the silver paper was
part of the order of the world. The sash of the window would not work
quite properly, owing to a slight subsidence in the wall, and even when
the window was fastened there was always a narrow slit to the left hand
between the window and its frame; through this slit came draughts, and
thus very keen frosts were remembered by the nights when Mrs. Baines
caused the sash to be forced and kept at its full height by means of
wedges--the slit of exposure was part of the order of the world.

<p/>They possessed only one bed, one washstand, and one dressing-table; but
in some other respects they were rather fortunate girls, for they had
two mahogany wardrobes; this mutual independence as regards wardrobes
was due partly to Mrs. Baines's strong commonsense, and partly to their
father's tendency to spoil them a little. They had, moreover, a chest
of drawers with a curved front, of which structure Constance occupied
two short drawers and one long one, and Sophia two long drawers. On it
stood two fancy work-boxes, in which each sister kept jewellery, a
savings-bank book, and other treasures, and these boxes were absolutely
sacred to their respective owners. They were different, but one was not
more magnificent than the other. Indeed, a rigid equality was the rule
in the chamber, the single exception being that behind the door were
three hooks, of which Constance commanded two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia began, when Constance appeared. <div class="bookquote">``How's darling Mr.
Povey?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) back, and smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) two hands, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) held up in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Asleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``At least mother thinks so. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says sleep is
the best thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`It will probably come on again,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked, undressing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`It will probably come on again.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>These words were a quotation from the utterances of darling Mr. Povey
on the stairs, and Sophia delivered them with an exact imitation of Mr.
Povey's vocal mannerism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, firmly, approaching the bed, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you
wouldn't be so silly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had benevolently ignored the satirical note
in Sophia's first remark, but a strong instinct in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rose up and
objected to further derision. <div class="bookquote">``Surely you've done enough for one day!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) added.

<p/>For answer Sophia exploded into violent laughter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made no
attempt to control. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) laughed too long and too freely while Constance
stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ don't know what's come over you!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only because I can't look at it without simply going off into
fits!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia gasped out. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) held up a tiny object in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) left
hand.

<p/>Constance started, flushing. <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say you've kept it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) protested earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``How horrid you are, Sophia! Give it me at
once and let me throw it away. I never heard of such doings. Now give
it me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia objected, still laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't part with it for
worlds. It's too lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had laughed away all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) secret resentment against Constance for
having ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) during the whole evening and for being on such
intimate terms with their parents. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was ready to be candidly
jolly with Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, doggedly.

<p/>Sophia hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand under the clothes. <div class="bookquote">``You can have his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) old stump,
when it comes out, if you like. But not this. What a pity it's the
wrong one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia, I'm ashamed of you! Give it me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Then it was that Sophia first perceived Constance's extreme
seriousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was surprised and a little intimidated by it. For the
expression of Constance's face, usually so benign and calm, was harsh,
almost fierce. However, Sophia had a great deal of what is called
<div class="bookquote">``spirit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>and not even ferocity on the face of mild Constance could
intimidate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) for more than a few seconds. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaiety expired and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
teeth were hidden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've said nothing to mother--''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope you haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia put in tersely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I certainly shall if you don't throw that away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance
finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can say what you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia retorted, adding contemptuously a
term of opprobrium which has long since passed out of use: <div class="bookquote">``Cant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you give it me or won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a battle suddenly engaged in the bedroom. The atmosphere had
altered completely with the swiftness of magic. The beauty of Sophia,
the angelic tenderness of Constance, and the youthful, naive, innocent
charm of both of them, were transformed into something sinister and
cruel. Sophia lay back on the pillow amid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dark-brown hair, and
gazed with relentless defiance into the angry eyes of Constance, who
stood threatening by the bed. They could hear the gas singing over the
dressing-table, and their hearts beating the blood wildly in their
veins. They ceased to be young without growing old; the eternal had
leapt up in them from its sleep.

<p/>Constance walked away from the bed to the dressing-table and began to
loose her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair and brush it, holding back her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head, shaking it, and
bending forward, in the changeless gesture of that rite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was so
disturbed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had unconsciously reversed the customary order of
the toilette. After a moment Sophia slipped out of bed and, stepping
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bare feet to the chest of drawers, opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) work-box and
deposited the fragment of Mr. Povey therein; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dropped the lid with
an uncompromising bang, as if to say, <div class="bookquote">``We shall see if I am to be trod
upon, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Their eyes met again in the looking-glass. Then Sophia got
back into bed.

<p/>Five minutes later, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair was quite finished, Constance knelt
down and said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) prayers. Having said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) prayers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went straight
to Sophia's work-box, opened it, seized the fragment of Mr. Povey, ran
to the window, and frantically pushed the fragment through the slit
into the Square.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed nervously.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had accomplished this inconceivable transgression of the code of
honour, beyond all undoing, before Sophia could recover from the
stupefaction of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sacred work-box impudently violated. In a
single moment one of Sophia's chief ideals had been smashed utterly,
and that by the sweetest, gentlest creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had ever known. It was
a revealing experience for Sophia--and also for Constance. And it
frightened them equally. Sophia, staring at the text, <div class="bookquote">``Thou God seest
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>framed in straw over the chest of drawers, did not stir. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
defeated, and so profoundly moved in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) defeat that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not even
reflect upon the obvious inefficacy of illuminated texts as a deterrent
from evil-doing. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cared a fig for the fragment of Mr.
Povey! It was the moral aspect of the affair, and the astounding,
inexplicable development in Constance's character, that staggered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
into silent acceptance of the inevitable.

<p/>Constance, trembling, took pains to finish undressing with dignified
deliberation. Sophia's behaviour under the blow seemed too good to be
true; but it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) courage. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned out the gas and lay
down by Sophia. And there was a little shuffling, and then stillness
for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance in a tone that mingled
amicableness with righteousness, <div class="bookquote">``mother's decided with Aunt Harriet
that we are BOTH to leave school next term.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>A BATTLE

<p/>I


<p/>The day sanctioned by custom in the Five Towns for the making of pastry
is Saturday. But Mrs. Baines made her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pastry on Friday, because
Saturday afternoon was, of course, a busy time in the shop. It is true
that Mrs. Baines made her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pastry in the morning, and that Saturday
morning in the shop was scarcely different from any other morning.
Nevertheless, Mrs. Baines made her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pastry on Friday morning instead of
Saturday morning because Saturday afternoon was a busy time in the
shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was thus free to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) marketing without breath-taking
flurry on Saturday morning.

<p/>On the morning after Sophia's first essay in dentistry, therefore, Mrs.
Baines was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pastry in the underground kitchen. This kitchen,
Maggie's cavern-home, had the mystery of a church, and on dark days it
had the mystery of a crypt. The stone steps leading down to it from the
level of earth were quite unlighted. You felt for them with the feet of
faith, and when you arrived in the kitchen, the kitchen, by contrast,
seemed luminous and gay; the architect may have considered and intended
this effect of the staircase. The kitchen saw day through a wide,
shallow window whose top touched the ceiling and whose bottom had been
out of the girls' reach until long after they had begun to go to
school. Its panes were small, and about half of them were of the <div class="bookquote">``knot''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>kind, through which no object could be distinguished; the other half
were of a later date, and stood for the march of civilization. The view
from the window consisted of the vast plate-glass windows of the newly
built Sun vaults, and of passing legs and skirts. A strong wire grating
prevented any excess of illumination, and also protected the glass from
the caprices of wayfarers in King Street. Boys had a habit of stopping
to kick with their full strength at the grating.

<p/>Forget-me-nots on a brown field ornamented the walls of the kitchen.
Its ceiling was irregular and grimy, and a beam ran across it; in this
beam were two hooks; from these hooks had once depended the ropes of a
swing, much used by Constance and Sophia in the old days before they
were grown up. A large range stood out from the wall between the stairs
and the window. The rest of the furniture comprised a table--against
the wall opposite the range--a cupboard, and two Windsor chairs.
Opposite the foot of the steps was a doorway, without a door, leading
to two larders, dimmer even than the kitchen, vague retreats made
visible by whitewash, where bowls of milk, dishes of cold bones, and
remainders of fruit-pies, reposed on stillages; in the corner nearest
the kitchen was a great steen in which the bread was kept. Another
doorway on the other side of the kitchen led to the first coal-cellar,
where was also the slopstone and tap, and thence a tunnel took you to
the second coal-cellar, where coke and ashes were stored; the tunnel
proceeded to a distant, infinitesimal yard, and from the yard, by ways
behind Mr. Critchlow's shop, you could finally emerge, astonished, upon
Brougham Street. The sense of the vast-obscure of those regions which
began at the top of the kitchen steps and ended in black corners of
larders or abruptly in the common dailiness of Brougham Street, a sense
which Constance and Sophia had acquired in infancy, remained with them
almost unimpaired as they grew old.

<p/>Mrs. Baines wore black alpaca, shielded by a white apron whose string
drew attention to the amplitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) waist. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sleeves were turned
up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hands, as far as the knuckles, covered with damp flour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
ageless smooth paste-board occupied a corner of the table, and near it
were her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) paste-roller, butter, some pie-dishes, shredded apples, sugar,
and other things. Those rosy hands were at work among a sticky
substance in a large white bowl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, are you there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) heard a voice from above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my chuck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Footsteps apparently reluctant and hesitating clinked on the stairs,
and Sophia entered the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put this curl straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head slightly
and holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) floured hands, which might not touch anything but
flour. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. It bothered me. And now stand out of my light. I'm
in a hurry. I must get into the shop so that I can send Mr. Povey off
to the dentist's. What is Constance doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helping Maggie to make Mr. Povey's bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Though fat, Mrs. Baines was a comely woman, with fine brown hair, and
confidently calm eyes that indicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own capacity to
accomplish whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could be called on to accomplish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) looked
neither more nor less than her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) age, which was forty-five. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was not a
native of the district, having been culled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) husband from the
moorland town of Axe, twelve miles off. Like nearly all women who
settle in a strange land upon marriage, at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
had considered herself just a trifle superior to the strange land and
its ways. This feeling, confirmed by long experience, had never left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). It was this feeling which induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) to continue making her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own
pastry--with two thoroughly trained <div class="bookquote">``great girls''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>in the house!
Constance could make good pastry, but it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother's pastry.
In pastry-making everything can be taught except the <div class="bookquote">``hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>light and
firm, which wields the roller. One is born with this hand, or without
it. And if one is born without it, the highest flights of pastry are
impossible. Constance was born without it. There were days when Sophia
seemed to possess it; but there were other days when Sophia's pastry
was uneatable by any one except Maggie. Thus Mrs. Baines, though
intensely proud and fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughters, had justifiably preserved a
certain condescension towards them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) honestly doubted whether either
of them would develop into the equal of their mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you little vixen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed. Sophia was stealing and eating
slices of half-cooked apple. <div class="bookquote">``This comes of having no breakfast! And
why didn't you come down to supper last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I forgot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines scrutinized the child's eyes, which met hers with a sort of
diffident boldness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew everything that a mother can know of a
daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sure that Sophia had no cause to be indisposed.
Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) scrutinized those eyes with a faint apprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can't find anything better to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``butter me the
inside of this dish. Are your hands clean? No, better not touch it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines was now at the stage of depositing little pats of butter in
rows on a large plain of paste. The best fresh butter! Cooking butter,
to say naught of lard, was unknown in that kitchen on Friday mornings.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) doubled the expanse of paste on itself and rolled the butter
in--supreme operation!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Constance has told you--about leaving school?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, in
the vein of small-talk, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) trimmed the paste to the shape of a
pie-dish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia replied shortly. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) moved away from the table to
the range. There was a toasting-fork on the rack, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began to play
with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, are you glad? Your aunt Harriet thinks you are quite old enough
to leave. And as we'd decided in any case that Constance was to leave,
it's really much simpler that you should both leave together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, rattling the toasting-fork, <div class="bookquote">``what am I going to
do after I've left school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines answered with that sententiousness which even the
cleverest of parents are not always clever enough to deny themselves,
<div class="bookquote">``I hope that both of you will do what you can to help your mother--and
father,''  (<font color='red'><b>parents</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, irritated. <div class="bookquote">``But what am I going to DO?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be considered. As Constance is to learn the millinery, I've
been thinking that you might begin to make yourself useful in the
underwear, gloves, silks, and so on. Then between you, you would one
day be able to manage quite nicely all that side of the shop, and I
should be--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go into the shop, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This interruption was made in a voice apparently cold and inimical. But
Sophia trembled with nervous excitement as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) uttered the words. Mrs.
Baines gave a brief glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), unobserved by the child, whose face
was towards the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) deemed herself a finished expert in the
reading of Sophia's moods; nevertheless, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked at that straight
back and proud head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no suspicion that the whole essence and
being of Sophia was silently but intensely imploring sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would be quiet with that fork,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with the
curious, grim politeness which often characterized her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) relations with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>The toasting-fork fell on the brick floor, after having rebounded from
the ash-tin. Sophia hurriedly replaced it on the rack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what SHALL you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines proceeded, conquering the
annoyance caused by the toasting-fork. <div class="bookquote">``I think it's me that should ask
you instead of you asking me. What shall you do? Your father and I were
both hoping you would take kindly to the shop and try to repay us for
all the--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines was unfortunate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) phrasing that morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) happened
to be, in truth, rather an exceptional parent, but that morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
seemed unable to avoid the absurd pretensions which parents of those
days assumed quite sincerely and which every good child with meekness
accepted.

<p/>Sophia was not a good child, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) obstinately denied in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart
the cardinal principle of family life, namely, that the parent has
conferred on the offspring a supreme favour by bringing it into the
world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother again, rudely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to leave school at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said passionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will have to leave school sooner or later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>argued Mrs.
Baines, with an air of quiet reasoning, of putting herself on a level
with Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``You can't stay at school for ever, my pet, can you? Out
of my way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hurried across the kitchen with a pie, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) whipped into the
oven, shutting the iron door with a careful gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to be a teacher. That's what I want
to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The tap in the coal-cellar, out of repair, could be heard distinctly
and systematically dropping water into a jar on the slopstone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A school-teacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>inquired Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. What other kind is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``With Miss
Chetwynd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think your father would like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't be quite suitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl demanded with a sort of ferocity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had
now quitted the range. A man's feet twinkled past the window.

<p/>Mrs. Baines was startled and surprised. Sophia's attitude was really
very trying; her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) manners deserved correction. But it was not these
phenomena which seriously affected Mrs. Baines; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was used to them
and had come to regard them as somehow the inevitable accompaniment of
Sophia's beauty, as the penalty of that surpassing charm which
occasionally emanated from the girl like a radiance. What startled and
surprised Mrs. Baines was the perfect and unthinkable madness of
Sophia's infantile scheme. It was a revelation to Mrs. Baines. Why in
the name of heaven had the girl taken such a notion into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head?
Orphans, widows, and spinsters of a certain age suddenly thrown on the
world--these were the women who, naturally, became teachers, because
they had to become something. But that the daughter of comfortable
parents, surrounded by love and the pleasures of an excellent home,
should wish to teach in a school was beyond the horizons of Mrs.
Baines's common sense. Comfortable parents of to-day who have a
difficulty in sympathizing with Mrs. Baines, should picture what their
feelings would be if their Sophias showed a rude desire to adopt the
vocation of chauffeur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would take you too much away from home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines,
achieving a second pie.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) spoke softly. The experience of being Sophia's mother for nearly
sixteen years had not been lost on Mrs. Baines, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was now
discovering undreamt-of dangers in Sophia's erratic temperament, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) presence of mind sufficiently well to behave with diplomatic
smoothness. It was undoubtedly humiliating to a mother to be forced to
use diplomacy in dealing with a girl in short sleeves. In HER day
mothers had been autocrats. But Sophia was Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What if it did?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia curtly demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there's no opening in Bursley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Chetwynd would have me, and then after a time I could go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) sister? What sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) sister that has a big school in London somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) unprecedented emotions by gazing into the oven
at the first pie. The pie was doing well, under all the circumstances.
In those few seconds she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) reflected rapidly and decided that to a
desperate disease a desperate remedy must be applied.

<p/>London! She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) herself had never been further than Manchester. London,
`after a time'! No, diplomacy would be misplaced in this crisis of
Sophia's development!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, in a changed and solemn voice, fronting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
daughter, and holding away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) apron those floured, ringed hands,
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know what has come over you. Truly I don't! Your father and I
are prepared to put up with a certain amount, but the line must be
drawn. The fact is, we've spoilt you, and instead of getting better as
you grow up, you're getting worse. Now let me hear no more of this,
please. I wish you would imitate your sister a little more. Of course
if you won't do your share in the shop, no one can make you. If you
choose to be an idler about the house, we shall have to endure it. We
can only advise you for your own good. But as for this ...''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
stopped, and let silence speak, and then finished: <div class="bookquote">``Let me hear no more
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a powerful and impressive speech, enunciated clearly in such a
tone as Mrs. Baines had not employed since dismissing a young lady
assistant five years ago for light conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mother--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A commotion of pails resounded at the top of the stone steps. It was
Maggie in descent from the bedrooms. Now, the Baines family passed its
life in doing its best to keep its affairs to itself, the assumption
being that Maggie and all the shop-staff -LRB-Mr. Povey possibly excepted-RRB-
were obsessed by a ravening appetite for that which did not concern
them. Therefore the voices of the Baineses always died away, or fell to
a hushed, mysterious whisper, whenever the foot of the eavesdropper was
heard.

<p/>Mrs. Baines put a floured finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) double chin. <div class="bookquote">``That will do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), with finality.

<p/>Maggie appeared, and Sophia, with a brusque precipitation of herself,
vanished upstairs.

<p/>II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, really, Mr. Povey, this is not like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, who,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) way into the shop, had discovered the Indispensable in the
cutting-out room.

<p/>It is true that the cutting-out room was almost Mr. Povey's sanctum,
whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) retired from time to time to cut out suits of clothes and
odd garments for the tailoring department. It is true that the
tailoring department flourished with orders, employing several tailors
who crossed legs in their own homes, and that appointments were
continually being made with customers for trying-on in that room. But
these considerations did not affect Mrs. Baines's attitude of
disapproval.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just cutting out that suit for the minister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/>The Reverend Mr. Murley, superintendent of the Wesleyan Methodist
circuit, called on Mr. Baines every week. On a recent visit Mr. Baines
had remarked that the parson's coat was ageing into green, and had
commanded that a new suit should be built and presented to Mr. Murley.
Mr. Murley, who had a genuine mediaeval passion for souls, and who
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Murley</b></font>) money and health freely in gratifying the passion, had
accepted the offer strictly on behalf of Christ, and had carefully
explained to Mr. Povey Christ's use for multifarious pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines tartly. <div class="bookquote">``But that's no reason why you
should be without a coat--and in this cold room too. You with
toothache!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was that Mr. Povey always doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) coat when cutting out.
Instead of a coat he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wore a tape-measure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My tooth doesn't hurt me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), sheepishly, dropping the great
scissors and picking up a cake of chalk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/>This exclamation shocked Mr. Povey. It was not unknown on the lips of
Mrs. Baines, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) usually reserved it for members of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own sex.
Mr. Povey could not recall that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had ever applied it to any
statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with the woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) thought. The
redness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) face did not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) to answer the question, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
face was always red after the operations of Friday in the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You men are all alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines continued. <div class="bookquote">``The very thought of
the dentist's cures you. Why don't you go in at once to Mr. Critchlow
and have it out--like a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Critchlow extracted teeth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) shop sign said <div class="bookquote">``Bone-setter and
chemist.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Povey had his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) views.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I make no account of Mr. Critchlow as a dentist,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then for goodness' sake go up to Oulsnam's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When? I can't very well go now, and to-morrow is Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you go now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course, I COULD go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) admitted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me advise you to go, then, and don't come back with that tooth in
your head. I shall be having you laid up next. Show some pluck, do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! pluck--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) protested, hurt.

<p/>At that moment Constance came down the passage singing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Constance, my pet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines called.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey was
assuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Povey is going to the dentist's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm going at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey confirmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I'm so GLAD!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance exclaimed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) face expressed a pure
sympathy, uncomplicated by critical sentiments. Mr. Povey rapidly
bathed in that sympathy, and then decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) must show himself a
man of oak and iron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always best to get these things done with,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), with stern
detachment. <div class="bookquote">``I'll just slip my overcoat on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, quickly. Mr. Povey's overcoat and hat
were hung on a hook immediately outside the room, in the passage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) the overcoat, anxious to be of service.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't call you in here to be Mr. Povey's valet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines
to herself with mild grimness; and aloud: <div class="bookquote">``I can't stay in the shop
long, Constance, but you can be there, can't you, till Mr. Povey comes
back? And if anything happens run upstairs and tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance eagerly consented. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hesitated and then
turned to obey at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you first, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). And
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) tone was peculiar, charged with import, confidential, and therefore
very flattering to Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll go out by the side-door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``It'll be
nearer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would save about ten yards, in two miles, by going
out through the side-door instead of through the shop. Who could have
guessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was ashamed to be seen going to the dentist's, afraid
lest, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) went through the shop, Mrs. Baines might follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) and
utter some remark prejudicial to his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dignity before the assistants?
-LRB-Mrs. Baines could have guessed, and did.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't want that tape-measure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, dryly, as Mr.
Povey dragged open the side-door. The ends of the forgotten
tape-measure were dangling beneath coat and overcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey scowled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) forgetfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll put it in its place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, offering to receive the
tape-measure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose they'll be long
over my bit of a job,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) added, with a difficult, miserable smile.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) went off down King Street, with an exterior of gay briskness
and dignified joy in the fine May morning. But there was no May morning
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) cowardly human heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi! Povey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from the Square.

<p/>But Mr. Povey disregarded all appeals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hand to the
plough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would not look back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi! Povey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Useless!

<p/>Mrs. Baines and Constance were both at the door. A middle-aged man was
crossing the road from Boulton Terrace, the lofty erection of new shops
which the envious rest of the Square had decided to call <div class="bookquote">``showy.''  (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
waved a hand to Mrs. Baines, who kept the door open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Dr. Harrop,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said to Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't be surprised if
that baby's come at last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wanted to tell Mr. Povey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance blushed, full of pride. Mrs. Povey, wife of <div class="bookquote">``our Mr. Povey's''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>renowned cousin, the high-class confectioner and baker in Boulton
Terrace, was a frequent subject of discussion in the Baines family,
but this was absolutely the first time that Mrs. Baines had
acknowledged, in presence of Constance, the marked and growing change
which had characterized Mrs. Povey's condition during recent months.
Such frankness on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mother, coming after the decision
about leaving school, proved indeed that Constance had ceased to be a
mere girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor, who carried a little bag and wore riding-breeches -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
the last doctor in Bursley to abandon the saddle for the dog-cart-RRB-,
saluted and straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) high, black stock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Morning! Morning, missy! Well, it's a boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Yonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Baines, indicating the confectioner's.

<p/>Dr. Harrop nodded. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
shoulder in the direction of the swaggering coward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I tell you, Constance?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
daughter.

<p/>Constance's confusion was equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pleasure. The alert doctor had
halted at the foot of the two steps, and with one hand in the pocket of
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``full-fall''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>breeches, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gazed up, smiling out of little eyes, at
the ample matron and the slender virgin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Been up most of th' night. Difficult! Difficult!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all RIGHT, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. Fine child! Fine child! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mother to some trouble,
for all that. Nothing fresh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes to indicate
Mr. Baines's bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with a different expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keeps cheerful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! A very good morning to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) strode off towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) house, which was lower down the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll turn over a new leaf now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Baines to
Constance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) closed the door. Constance knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother was
referring to the confectioner's wife; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) gathered that the hope was
slight in the extreme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you want to speak to me about, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) asked, as a way
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) delicious confusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut that door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines replied, pointing to the door which led
to the passage; and while Constance obeyed, Mrs. Baines herself shut
the staircase-door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) then said, in a low, guarded voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all this about Sophia wanting to be a school-teacher?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wanting to be a school-teacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance repeated, in tones of
amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said anything to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wants to keep on with Miss Chetwynd and be a
teacher.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines had half a mind to add that Sophia had mentioned
London. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) restrained herself. There are some things which one
cannot bring one's self to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Instead of going into the
shop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard of such a thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured brokenly, in the
excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) astonishment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was rolling up Mr. Povey's tape-measure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither did I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall you let her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>), mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither your father nor I would ever dream of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines
replied, with calm and yet terrible decision. <div class="bookquote">``I only mentioned it to
you because I thought Sophia would have told you something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>As Constance put Mr. Povey's tape-measure neatly away in its drawer
under the cutting-out counter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) thought how serious life was--what
with babies and Sophias. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was very proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother's confidence
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>); this simple pride filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ardent breast with a most
agreeable commotion. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wanted to help everybody, to show in some
way how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sympathized with and loved everybody. Even the madness
of Sophia did not weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) longing to comfort Sophia.

<p/>III

<p/>That afternoon there was a search for Sophia, whom no one had seen
since dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was discovered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother, sitting alone and
unoccupied in the drawing-room. The circumstance was in itself
sufficiently peculiar, for on weekdays the drawing-room was never used,
even by the girls during their holidays, except for the purpose of
playing the piano. However, Mrs. Baines offered no comment on Sophia's
geographical situation, nor on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) idleness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said, standing at the door, with a self-conscious effort
to behave as though nothing had happened, <div class="bookquote">``will you come and sit with
your father a bit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>answered Sophia, with a sort of cold alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia is coming, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines at the open door of the
bedroom, which was at right-angles with, and close to, the drawing-room
door. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) surged swishing along the corridor and went into the
showroom, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been called.

<p/>Sophia passed to the bedroom, the eternal prison of John Baines.
Although, on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) nervous restlessness, Mr. Baines was never
left alone, it was not a part of the usual duty of the girls to sit
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). The person who undertook the main portion of the vigils was a
certain Aunt Maria--whom the girls knew to be not a real aunt, not a
powerful, effective aunt like Aunt Harriet of Axe--but a poor second
cousin of John Baines; one of those necessitous, pitiful relatives who
so often make life difficult for a great family in a small town. The
existence of Aunt Maria, after being rather a <div class="bookquote">``trial''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>to the Baineses,
had for twelve years past developed into something absolutely
<div class="bookquote">``providential''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>for them. -LRB-It is to be remembered that in those days
Providence was still busying himself with everybody's affairs, and
foreseeing the future in the most extraordinary manner. Thus, having
foreseen that John Baines would have a <div class="bookquote">``stroke''  (<font color='red'><b>John Baines/John</b></font>)</div>and need a faithful,
tireless nurse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had begun fifty years in advance by creating Aunt
Maria, and had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) carefully in misfortune's way, so that at the
proper moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would be ready to cope with the stroke. Such at least
is the only theory which will explain the use by the Baineses, and
indeed by all thinking Bursley, of the word <div class="bookquote">``providential''  (<font color='red'><b>Bursley/Bursley Town Silver Prize Band</b></font>)</div>in
connection with Aunt Maria.-RRB- She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was a shrivelled little woman, capable
of sitting twelve hours a day in a bedroom and thriving on the regime.
At nights she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) went home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) little cottage in Brougham Street; she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) Thursday afternoons and generally her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) Sundays, and during the
school vacations she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was supposed to come only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) felt inclined,
or when the cleaning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) cottage permitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) to come. Hence, in
holiday seasons, Mr. Baines weighed more heavily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) household than
at other times, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) nurses relieved each other according to the
contingencies of the moment rather than by a set programme of hours.

<p/>The tragedy in ten thousand acts of which that bedroom was the scene,
almost entirely escaped Sophia's perception, as it did Constance's.
Sophia went into the bedroom as though it were a mere bedroom, with its
majestic mahogany furniture, its crimson rep curtains -LRB-edged with
gold-RRB-, and its white, heavily tasselled counterpane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was aged four
when John Baines had suddenly been seized with giddiness on the steps
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) shop, and had fallen, and, without losing consciousness, had
been transformed from John Baines into a curious and pathetic survival
of John Baines. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no notion of the thrill which ran through the
town on that night when it was known that John Baines had had a stroke,
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) left arm and left leg and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) right eyelid were paralyzed,
and that the active member of the Local Board, the orator, the
religious worker, the very life of the town's life, was permanently
done for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never heard of the crisis through which her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother,
assisted by Aunt Harriet, had passed, and out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
triumphantly emerged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not yet old enough even to suspect it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) possessed only the vaguest memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
finished with the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) simply as an organism on a bed,
whose left side was wasted, whose eyes were often inflamed, whose mouth
was crooked, who had no creases from the nose to the corners of the
mouth like other people, who experienced difficulty in eating because
the food would somehow get between his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gums and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cheek, who slept a
great deal but was excessively fidgety while awake, who seemed to hear
what was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a long time after it was uttered, as if the sense
had to travel miles by labyrinthine passages to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brain, and who
talked very, very slowly in a weak, trembling voice.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had an image of that remote brain as something with a red spot
on it, for once Constance had said: <div class="bookquote">``Mother, why did father have a
stroke?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Baines had replied: <div class="bookquote">``It was a haemorrhage of the
brain, my dear, here'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>--putting a thimbled finger on a particular part
of Sophia's head.

<p/>Not merely had Constance and Sophia never really felt their father's
tragedy; Mrs. Baines herself had largely lost the sense of it--such is
the effect of use. Even the ruined organism only remembered fitfully
and partially that it had once been John Baines. And if Mrs. Baines had
not, by the habit of years, gradually built up a gigantic fiction that
the organism remained ever the supreme consultative head of the family;
if Mr. Critchlow had not obstinately continued to treat it as a crony,
the mass of living and dead nerves on the rich Victorian bedstead would
have been of no more account than some Aunt Maria in similar case.
These two persons, his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) friend, just managed to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
morally alive by indefatigably feeding his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) importance and his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) dignity.
The feat was a miracle of stubborn self-deceiving, splendidly blind
devotion, and incorrigible pride.

<p/>When Sophia entered the room, the paralytic followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
nervous gaze until she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had sat down on the end of the sofa at the foot
of the bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) seemed to study her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) for a long time, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
murmured in his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) slow, enfeebled, irregular voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that Sophia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) answered cheerfully.

<p/>And after another pause, the old man said: <div class="bookquote">``Ay! It's Sophia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>And later: <div class="bookquote">``Your mother said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should send ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia saw that this was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bad, dull days. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had,
occasionally, days of comparative nimbleness, when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wits seized
almost easily the meanings of external phenomena.

<p/>Presently his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sallow face and long white beard began to slip down the
steep slant of the pillows, and a troubled look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left eye.
Sophia rose and, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) armpits, lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) higher
in the bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not heavy, but only a strong girl of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) years could
have done it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``That's it. That's it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) controllable right hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood by
the bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so young and fresh, such an incarnation of the spirit
of health, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so far gone in decay and corruption, that there
seemed in this contact of body with body something unnatural and
repulsive. But Sophia did not so feel it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and made preparatory noises in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) waited.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued after an interval, now clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``Your mother's
been telling me you don't want to go in the shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anxious, dim gaze met hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mumbled, with the extreme of slowness. <div class="bookquote">``I'm surprised
at ye... Trade's bad, bad! Ye know trade's bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still
clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arm.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nodded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, in fact, aware of the badness of trade, caused by
a vague war in the United States. The words <div class="bookquote">``North''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``South''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>had a
habit of recurring in the conversation of adult persons. That was all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew, though people were starving in the Five Towns as they were
starving in Manchester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought struggled on, like an aged horse
over a hilly road. <div class="bookquote">``There's your mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated, as if wishful to
direct Sophia's attention to the spectacle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Working
hard! Con--Constance and you must help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)... Trade's bad! What can I
do ... lying here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The heat from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dry fingers was warming her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to move,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not have withdrawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arm without appearing impatient.
For a similar reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not avert her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glance. A deepening flush
increased the lustre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) immature loveliness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
But though it was so close he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not feel that radiance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had long
outlived a susceptibility to the strange influences of youth and beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Teaching!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay! I canna' allow that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) white beard rose at the tip as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up at the ceiling
above his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, reflectively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questioned finally.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nodded again; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not
have spoken. Glittering tears enriched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was saddened into
a profound and sudden grief by the ridiculousness of the scene. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
youth, physical perfection; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brimmed with energy, with the sense of
vital power; all existence lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips
together she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt capable of outvying no matter whom in fortitude of
resolution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had always hated the shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not understand how
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and Constance could bring themselves to be deferential and
flattering to every customer that entered. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not understand
it; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother -LRB-though a proud woman-RRB- and Constance seemed to
practise such behaviour so naturally, so unquestioningly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
never imparted to either of them her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) guessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would not be comprehended. But long ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
never <div class="bookquote">``go into the shop.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would be expected to do
something, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had fixed on teaching as the one possibility. These
decisions had formed part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) inner life for years past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not
mentioned them, being secretive and scarcely anxious for
unpleasantness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been slowly preparing herself to mention
them. The extraordinary announcement that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was to leave school at
the same time as Constance had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) unawares, before the
preparations ripening in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind were complete--before, as it were,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had girded up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loins for the fray. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been caught unready,
and the opposing forces had obtained the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But did they
suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was beaten?

<p/>No argument from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother! No hearing, even! Just a curt and haughty
``Let me hear no more of this'! And so the great desire of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life,
nourished year after year in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) inmost bosom, was to be flouted and
sacrificed with a word! Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother did not appear ridiculous in the
affair, for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother was a genuine power, commanding by turns genuine
love and genuine hate, and always, till then, obedience and the respect
of reason. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father who appeared tragically ridiculous; and,
in turn, the whole movement against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grew grotesque in its
absurdity. Here was this antique wreck, helpless, useless,
powerless--merely pathetic--actually thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had only to
mumble in order to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) `understand'! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) perceived
nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a ferocious egoist, like most bedridden invalids, out
of touch with life,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought himself justified in making
destinies, and capable of making them! Sophia could not, perhaps,
define the feelings which overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of
their tendency. They aged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), by years. They aged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) so that, in a
kind of momentary ecstasy of insight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be a good girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure o' that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was too painful. The grotesqueness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father's complacency
humiliated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) past bearing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was humiliated, not for herself, but
for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Singular creature! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ran out of the room.

<p/>Fortunately Constance was passing in the corridor, otherwise Sophia had
been found guilty of a great breach of duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) whispered hysterically to Constance, and fled
upwards to the second floor.

<p/>IV

<p/>At supper, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) red, downcast eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had returned to sheer
girlishness again, overawed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother. The meal had an unusual
aspect. Mr. Povey, safe from the dentist's, but having lost two teeth
in two days, was being fed on `slops'--bread and milk, to wit; he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) sat
near the fire. The others had cold pork, half a cold apple-pie, and
cheese; but Sophia only pretended to eat; each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried to
swallow, the tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) throat shut itself up.
Mrs. Baines and Constance had a too careful air of eating just as
usual. Mrs. Baines's handsome ringlets dominated the table under the
gas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so set up with my pastry to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Baines,
critically munching a fragment of pie-crust.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) rang a little hand-bell. Maggie appeared from the cave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wore a
plain white bib-less apron, but no cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, will you have some pie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you can spare it, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>This was Maggie's customary answer to offers of food.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can always spare it, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mistress, as usual. <div class="bookquote">``Sophia,
if you aren't going to use that plate, give it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie disappeared with liberal pie.

<p/>Mrs. Baines then talked to Mr. Povey about his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) condition, and in
particular as to the need for precautions against taking cold in the
bereaved gum. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was a brave and determined woman; from start to
finish she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) behaved as though nothing whatever in the household except
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pastry and Mr. Povey had deviated that day from the normal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
kissed Constance and Sophia with the most exact equality, and called
them `my chucks' when they went up to bed.

<p/>Constance, excellent kind heart, tried to imitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's tactics
as the girls undressed in their room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not do
better than ignore Sophia's deplorable state.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother's new dress is quite finished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s going to wear it on
Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), blandly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you say another word I'll scratch your eyes out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia turned on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) viciously, with a catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) voice, and then began to sob at
intervals. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not mean this threat, but its utterance gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
relief. Constance, faced with the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's shoes were too
big for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), decided to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyesight.

<p/>Long after the gas was out, rare sobs from Sophia shook the bed, and
they both lay awake in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you and mother have been talking me over finely to-day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia burst forth, to Constance's surprise, in a wet voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``Mother only told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Told you what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you wanted to be a teacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I will be, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>thought Constance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made no audible
comment.

<p/>There was another detached, hard sob. And then, such is the astonishing
talent of youth, they both fell asleep.

<p/>The next morning, early, Sophia stood gazing out of the window at the
Square. It was Saturday, and all over the Square little stalls, with
yellow linen roofs, were being erected for the principal market of the
week. In those barbaric days Bursley had a majestic edifice, black as
basalt, for the sale of dead animals by the limb and rib--it was
entitled `the Shambles'--but vegetables, fruit, cheese, eggs, and
pikelets were still sold under canvas. Eggs are now offered at five
farthings apiece in a palace that cost twenty-five thousand pounds. Yet
you will find people in Bursley ready to assert that things generally
are not what they were, and that in particular the romance of life has
gone. But until it has gone it is never romance. To Sophia, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was in a mood which usually stimulates the sense of the romantic, there
was nothing of romance in this picturesque tented field. It was just
the market. Holl's, the leading grocer's, was already open, at the
extremity of the Square, and a boy apprentice was sweeping the pavement
in front of it. The public-houses were open, several of them
specializing in hot rum at 5.30 a.m.. The town-crier, in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blue coat
with red facings, crossed the Square, carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) big bell by the
tongue. There was the same shocking hole in one of Mrs. Povey's
-LRB-confectioner's-RRB- window-curtains--a hole which even her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) recent travail
could scarcely excuse. Such matters it was that Sophia noticed with
dull, smarting eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia, you'll take your death of cold standing there like that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) jumped. The voice was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's. That vigorous woman, after a
calm night by the side of the paralytic, was already up and neatly
dressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) carried a bottle and an egg-cup, and a small quantity of
jam in a table-spoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get into bed again, do! There's a dear! You're shivering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div><p/>White Sophia obeyed. It was true; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was shivering. Constance awoke.
Mrs. Baines went to the dressing-table and filled the egg-cup out of
the bottle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that for, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked sleepily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's for Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with good cheer. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Sophia!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) advanced with the egg-cup in one hand and the table-spoon in
the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Sophia, who well knew what it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Castor-oil, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, winningly.

<p/>The ludicrousness of attempting to cure obstinacy and yearnings for a
freer life by means of castor-oil is perhaps less real than apparent.
The strange interdependence of spirit and body, though only understood
intelligently in these intelligent days, was guessed at by sensible
mediaeval mothers. And certainly, at the period when Mrs. Baines
represented modernity, castor-oil was still the remedy of remedies. It
had supplanted cupping. And, if part of its vogue was due to its
extreme unpleasantness, it had at least proved its qualities in many a
contest with disease. Less than two years previously old Dr. Harrop
-LRB-father of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) who told Mrs. Baines about Mrs. Povey-RRB-, being then aged
eighty-six, had fallen from top to bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
scrambled up, taken a dose of castor-oil at once, and on the morrow was
as well as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never seen a staircase. This episode was town
property and had sunk deep into all hearts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, in dejection. <div class="bookquote">``I'm quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You simply ate nothing all day yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As if to say, <div class="bookquote">``There's always this silly fuss with
castor-oil. Don't keep me waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't WANT any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, irritated and captious.

<p/>The two girls lay side by side, on their backs. They seemed very thin
and fragile in comparison with the solidity of their mother. Constance
wisely held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) peace.

<p/>Mrs. Baines put her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) lips together, meaning: <div class="bookquote">``This is becoming tedious.
I shall have to be angry in another moment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) again.

<p/>The girls could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) foot tapping on the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really don't want it, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia fought. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I ought to
know whether I need it or not!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was insolence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia, will you take this medicine, or won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>In conflicts with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) children, the mother's ultimatum always took the
formula in which this phrase was cast. The girls knew, when things had
arrived at the pitch of `or won't you' spoken in Mrs. Baines's firmest
tone, that the end was upon them. Never had the ultimatum failed.

<p/>There was a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll thank you to mind your manners,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, sullenly and flatly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
face in the pillow.

<p/>It was a historic moment in the family life. Mrs. Baines thought the
last day had come. But still she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) held herself in dignity while the
apocalypse roared in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ears.

<p/>``OF COURSE I CAN``T FORCE YOU TO TAKE IT,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said with superb
evenness, masking anger by compassionate grief. <div class="bookquote">``You're a big girl and
a naughty girl. And if you will be ill you must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this immense admission, Mrs. Baines departed.

<p/>Constance trembled.

<p/>Nor was that all. In the middle of the morning, when Mrs. Baines was
pricing new potatoes at a stall at the top end of the Square, and
Constance choosing threepennyworth of flowers at the same stall, whom
should they both see, walking all alone across the empty corner by the
Bank, but Sophia Baines! The Square was busy and populous, and Sophia
was only visible behind a foreground of restless, chattering figures.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was unmistakably seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been beyond the Square and was
returning. Constance could scarcely believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes. Mrs. Baines's
heart jumped. For let it be said that the girls never under any
circumstances went forth without permission, and scarcely ever alone.
That Sophia should be at large in the town, without leave, without
notice, exactly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) were her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own mistress, was a proposition
which a day earlier had been inconceivable. Yet there she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, and
moving with a leisureliness that must be described as effrontery!

<p/>Red with apprehension, Constance wondered what would happen. Mrs.
Baines said nought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) feelings, did not even indicate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had
seen the scandalous, the breath-taking sight. And they descended the
Square laden with the lighter portions of what they had bought during
an hour of buying. They went into the house by the King Street door;
and the first thing they heard was the sound of the piano upstairs.
Nothing happened. Mr. Povey had his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dinner alone; then the table was
laid for them, and the bell rung, and Sophia came insolently downstairs
to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and sister. And nothing happened. The dinner was
silently eaten, and Constance having rendered thanks to God, Sophia
rose abruptly to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Constance, stay where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines suddenly to
Constance, who had meant to flee. Constance was therefore destined to
be present at the happening, doubtless in order to emphasize its
importance and seriousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines resumed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) younger daughter in an ominous
voice. <div class="bookquote">``No, please shut the door. There is no reason why everybody in
the house should hear. Come right into the room--right in! That's it.
Now, what were you doing out in the town this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia was fidgeting nervously with the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) little black apron,
and worrying a seam of the carpet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) toes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) left shoulder, at first smiling vaguely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said nothing,
but every limb, every glance, every curve, was speaking. Mrs. Baines
sat firmly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own rocking-chair, full of the sensation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had
Sophia, as it were, writhing on the end of a skewer. Constance was
braced into a moveless anguish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will have an answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs. Baines. <div class="bookquote">``What were you doing out
in the town this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I just went out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>answered Sophia at length, still with eyes downcast,
and in a rather simpering tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you go out? You said nothing to me about going out. I heard
Constance ask you if you were coming with us to the market, and you
said, very rudely, that you weren't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say it rudely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia objected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes you did. And I'll thank you not to answer back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to say it rudely, did I, Constance?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia's head
turned sharply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister. Constance knew not where to look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't answer back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines repeated sternly. <div class="bookquote">``And don't try to
drag Constance into this, for I won't have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course Constance is always right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>observed Sophia, with an
irony whose unparalleled impudence shook Mrs. Baines to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) massive
foundations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to have to smack you, child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) temper flashed out and you could see ringlets vibrating under the
provocation of Sophia's sauciness. Then Sophia's lower lip began to
fall and to bulge outwards, and all the muscles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face seemed to
slacken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a very naughty girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with restraint. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I've
got her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines to herself. <div class="bookquote">``I may just as well keep my
temper.'' (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>And a sob broke out of Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was behaving like a little child.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bore no trace of the young maiden sedately crossing the Square
without leave and without an escort.

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was going to cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, breathing relief.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines aloud.

<p/>A second sob. Mrs. Baines manufactured patience to meet the demand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You tell me not to answer back, and then you say you're waiting,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia blubbered thickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that you say? How can I tell what you say if you talk like
that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>-LRB-But Mrs. Baines failed to hear out of discretion, which is
better than valour.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's of no consequence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia blurted forth in a sob. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
weeping now, and tears were ricocheting off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lovely crimson cheeks
on to the carpet; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) whole body was trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a great baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines enjoined, with a touch of rough
persuasiveness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's you who make me cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``You make me cry and
then you call me a great baby!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And sobs ran through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) frame like
waves one after another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spoke so indistinctly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother now
really had some difficulty in catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with god-like calm, <div class="bookquote">``it is not I who make
you cry. It is your guilty conscience makes you cry. I have merely
asked you a question, and I intend to have an answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Here Sophia checked the sobs with an immense effort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you told me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I just went out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will have no trifling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines. <div class="bookquote">``What did you go out for,
and without telling me? If you had told me afterwards, when I came in,
of your own accord, it might have been different. But no, not a word!
It is I who have to ask! Now, quick! I can't wait any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I gave way over the castor-oil, my girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own
breast. <div class="bookquote">``But not again! Not again!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean--you don't know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sobbing recommenced tempestuously. <div class="bookquote">``I mean I don't know. I just
went out.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) voice rose; it was noisy, but scarcely articulate. <div class="bookquote">``What
if I did go out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia, I am not going to be talked to like this. If you think because
you're leaving school you can do exactly as you like--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I want to leave school?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>yelled Sophia, stamping. In a moment a
hurricane of emotion overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), as though that stamping of the
foot had released the demons of the storm. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face was transfigured by
uncontrollable passion. <div class="bookquote">``You all want to make me miserable!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
shrieked with terrible violence. <div class="bookquote">``And now I can't even go out! You are
a horrid, cruel woman, and I hate you! And you can do what you like!
Put me in prison if you like! I know you'd be glad if I was dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dashed from the room, banging the door with a shock that made the
house rattle. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had shouted so loud that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have been
heard in the shop, and even in the kitchen. It was a startling
experience for Mrs. Baines. Mrs. Baines, why did you saddle yourself
with a witness? Why did you so positively say that you intended to have
an answer?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) stammered, pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) dignity about her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) shoulders like a
garment that the wind has snatched off. <div class="bookquote">``I never dreamed that poor girl
had such a dreadful temper! What a pity it is, for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) OWN sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It
was the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could do.

<p/>Constance, who could not bear to witness her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother's humiliation,
vanished very quietly from the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) got halfway upstairs to the
second floor, and then, hearing the loud, rapid, painful, regular
intake of sobbing breaths, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hesitated and crept down again.

<p/>This was Mrs. Baines's first costly experience of the child thankless
for having been brought into the world. It robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) profound,
absolute belief in herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
house and could do everything there. And lo! she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had suddenly stumbled
against an unsuspected personality at large in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) house, a sort of
hard marble affair that informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) by means of bumps that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did
not want to be hurt she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) must keep out of the way.

<p/>V

<p/>On the Sunday afternoon Mrs. Baines was trying to repose a little in
the drawing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had caused a fire to be lighted. Constance
was in the adjacent bedroom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) father. Sophia lay between
blankets in the room overhead with a feverish cold. This cold and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
new dress were Mrs. Baines's sole consolation at the moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
prophesied a cold for Sophia, refuser of castor-oil, and it had come.
Sophia had received, for standing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nightdress at a draughty
window of a May morning, what Mrs. Baines called `nature's slap in the
face.'' As for the dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had worshipped God in it, and prayed for
Sophia in it, before dinner; and its four double rows of gimp on the
skirt had been accounted a great success. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lace-bordered mantle
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) low, stringed bonnet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had assuredly given a unique lustre to
the congregation at chapel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was stout; but the fashions,
prescribing vague outlines, broad downward slopes, and vast amplitudes,
were favourable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shape. It must not be supposed that stout women
of a certain age never seek to seduce the eye and trouble the
meditations of man by other than moral charms. Mrs. Baines knew that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was comely, natty, imposing, and elegant; and the knowledge gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) real pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would look over her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) shoulder in the glass as
anxious as a girl: make no mistake.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did not repose; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sat thinking, in exactly the
same posture as Sophia's two afternoons previously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have been
surprised to hear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attitude, bearing, and expression powerfully
recalled those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reprehensible daughter. But it was so. A good
angel made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) restless, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went idly to the window and glanced
upon the empty, shuttered Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) too, majestic matron, had
strange, brief yearnings for an existence more romantic than this;
shootings across her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spirit's firmament of tailed comets; soft,
inexplicable melancholies. The good angel, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from such a
mood, directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze to a particular spot at the top of the square.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) passed at once out of the room--not precisely in a hurry, yet
without wasting time. In a recess under the stairs, immediately outside
the door, was a box about a foot square and eighteen inches deep
covered with black American cloth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bent down and unlocked this box,
which was padded within and contained the Baines silver tea-service.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) drew from the box teapot, sugar-bowl, milk-jug, sugar-tongs,
hot-water jug, and cake-stand -LRB-a flattish dish with an arching
semicircular handle-RRB---chased vessels, silver without and silver-gilt
within; glittering heirlooms that shone in the dark corner like the
secret pride of respectable families. These she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put on a tray that
always stood on end in the recess. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked upwards through the
banisters to the second floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) piercingly whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came a voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you dressed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum. I'm just coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, put on your muslin.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Apron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines implied.

<p/>Maggie understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take these for tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines when Maggie descended. <div class="bookquote">``Better
rub them over. You know where the cake is--that new one. The best cups.
And the silver spoons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both heard a knock at the side-door, far off, below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Baines. <div class="bookquote">``Now take these right down into the
kitchen before you open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, departing.

<p/>Mrs. Baines was wearing a black alpaca apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) removed it and put on
another one of black satin embroidered with yellow flowers, which, by
merely inserting her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) arm into the chamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had taken from off the
chest of drawers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bedroom. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) fixed herself in the
drawing-room.

<p/>Maggie returned, rather short of breath, convoying the visitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Miss Chetwynd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, rising to welcome. ``I'm sure I'm
delighted to see you. I saw you coming down the Square, and I said to
myself, <div class="bookquote">``Now, I do hope Miss Chetwynd isn't going to forget us.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Chetwynd, simpering momentarily, came forward with that
self-conscious, slightly histrionic air, which is one of the penalties
of pedagogy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) lived under the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) pupils. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) life was one
ceaseless effort to avoid doing anything which might influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
charges for evil or shock the natural sensitiveness of their parents.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had to wind her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) earthly way through a forest of the most delicate
susceptibilities--fern-fronds that stretched across the path, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) must not even accidentally disturb with her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) skirt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) passed. No
wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) walked mincingly! No wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had a habit of keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
elbows close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) sides, and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) mantle tight in the streets!
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) prospectus talked about 'a sound and religious course of training,<div class="bookquote">''
`study embracing the usual branches of English, with music by a
talented master, drawing, dancing, and calisthenics.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Also `needlework
plain and ornamental;' also `moral influence;' and finally about terms,
`which are very moderate, and every particular, with references to
parents and others, furnished on application.'' -LRB-Sometimes, too, without
application.-RRB- As an illustration of the delicacy of fern-fronds, that
single word `dancing' had nearly lost her (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>) Constance and Sophia seven
years before!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>) was a pinched virgin, aged forty, and not `well off;' in her (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>) family
the gift of success had been monopolized by her (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>) elder sister. For these
characteristics Mrs. Baines, as a matron in easy circumstances, pitied
Miss Chetwynd. On the other hand, Miss Chetwynd could choose ground
from which to look down upon Mrs. Baines, who after all was in trade.
Miss Chetwynd had no trace of the local accent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) spoke with a
southern refinement which the Five Towns, while making fun of it,
envied. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) O's had a genteel leaning towards <div class="bookquote">``ow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as ritualism
leans towards Romanism. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was the fount of etiquette, a wonder of
correctness; in the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) pupils' parents not so much 'a perfect
LADY' as 'a PERFECT lady.'' So that it was an extremely nice question
whether, upon the whole, Mrs. Baines secretly condescended to Miss
Chetwynd or Miss Chetwynd to Mrs. Baines. Perhaps Mrs. Baines, by
virtue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wifehood, carried the day.

<p/>Miss Chetwynd, carefully and precisely seated, opened the conversation
by explaining that even if Mrs. Baines had not written she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) should have
called in any case, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) made a practice of calling at the home of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pupils in vacation time: which was true. Mrs. Baines, it should be
stated, had on Friday afternoon sent to Miss Chetwynd one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) most
luxurious notes--lavender-coloured paper with scalloped edges, the
selectest mode of the day--to announce, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) Italian hand, that
Constance and Sophia would both leave school at the end of the next
term, and giving reasons in regard to Sophia.

<p/>Before the visitor had got very far, Maggie came in with a lacquered
tea-caddy and the silver teapot and a silver spoon on a lacquered tray.
Mrs. Baines, while continuing to talk, chose a key from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bunch,
unlocked the tea-caddy, and transferred four teaspoonfuls of tea from
it to the teapot and relocked the caddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strawberry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mysteriously whispered to Maggie; and Maggie
disappeared, bearing the tray and its contents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is your sister? It is quite a long time since she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was down
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines went on to Miss Chetwynd, after whispering
<div class="bookquote">``strawberry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark was merely in the way of small-talk--for the hostess felt a
certain unwilling hesitation to approach the topic of daughters--but it
happened to suit the social purpose of Miss Chetwynd to a nicety. Miss
Chetwynd was a vessel brimming with great tidings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is very well, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div>said Miss Chetwynd, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) expression
grew exceedingly vivacious. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) face glowed with pride as she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Of course everything is changed now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Baines, with polite curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div>said Miss Chetwynd. <div class="bookquote">``You've not heard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines. Miss Chetwynd knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had not heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About Elizabeth's engagement? To the Reverend Archibald Jones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>It is the fact that Mrs. Baines was taken aback. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did nothing
indiscreet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did not give vent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) excusable amazement that the
elder Miss Chetwynd should be engaged to any one at all, as some women
would have done in the stress of the moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) presence of
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is really MOST interesting!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>).

<p/>It was. For Archibald Jones was one of the idols of the Wesleyan
Methodist Connexion, a special preacher famous throughout England. At
``Anniversaries' and ``Trust sermons,'' Archibald Jones had probably no
rival. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) Christian name helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>); it was a luscious, resounding
mouthful for admirers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was not an itinerant minister, migrating
every three years. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) function was to direct the affairs of the <div class="bookquote">``Book
Room,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the publishing department of the Connexion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) lived in London,
and shot out into the provinces at week-ends, preaching on Sundays and
giving a lecture, tinctured with bookishness, `in the chapel' on Monday
evenings. In every town he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) visited there was competition for the
privilege of entertaining him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had zeal, indefatigable energy, and a
breezy wit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was a widower of fifty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) wife had been dead for
twenty years. It had seemed as if women were not for this bright star.
And here Elizabeth Chetwynd, who had left the Five Towns a quarter of a
century before at the age of twenty, had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)! Austere,
moustached, formidable, desiccated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must have done it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
powerful intellect! It must be a union of intellects! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had been
impressed by hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and then their intellects had
kissed. Within a week fifty thousand women in forty counties had
pictured to themselves this osculation of intellects, and shrugged
their shoulders, and decided once more that men were incomprehensible.
These great ones in London, falling in love like the rest! But no! Love
was a ribald and voluptuous word to use in such a matter as this. It
was generally felt that the Reverend Archibald Jones and Miss Chetwynd
the elder would lift marriage to what would now be termed an astral
plane.

<p/>After tea had been served, Mrs. Baines gradually recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
position, both in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own private esteem and in the deference of Miss
Aline Chetwynd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You can talk about your sister, and you can call HIM
Archibald, and you can mince up your words. But have you got a
tea-service like this? Can you conceive more perfect strawberry jam
than this? Did not my dress cost more than you spend on your clothes in
a year? Has a man ever looked at you? After all, is there not something
about my situation ... in short, something...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) did not say this aloud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) in no way deviated from the scrupulous
politeness of a hostess. There was nothing in even her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) tone to indicate
that Mrs. John Baines was a personage. Yet it suddenly occurred to Miss
Chetwynd that her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) pride in being the prospective sister-in-law of the
Rev. Archibald Jones would be better for a while in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) pocket. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
inquired after Mr. Baines. After this the conversation limped somewhat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you weren't surprised by my letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was and I wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div>answered Miss Chetwynd, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) professional
manner and not her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) manner of a prospective sister-in-law. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I
am naturally sorry to lose two such good pupils, but we can't keep our
pupils for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) smiled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was not without fortitude--it is
easier to lose pupils than to replace them. <div class="bookquote">``Still'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--a pause--<div class="bookquote">``what you
say of Sophia is perfectly true, perfectly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) is quite as advanced as
Constance. Still'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--another pause and a more rapid enunciation--<div class="bookquote">``Sophia
is by no means an ordinary girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hasn't been a very great trouble to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Chetwynd. <div class="bookquote">``Sophia and I have got on very well
together. I have always tried to appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reason. I have never
FORCED her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ... Now, with some girls ... In some ways I look on Sophia
as the most remarkable girl--not pupil--but the most remarkable--what
shall I say?--individuality, that I have ever met with.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
demeanour added, <div class="bookquote">``And, mind you, this is something--from me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) told herself, <div class="bookquote">``I am not your common
foolish parent. I see my children impartially. I am incapable of being
flattered concerning them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was flattered, and the thought shaped itself that
really Sophia was no ordinary girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) has talked to you about becoming a teacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div>asked Miss
Chetwynd, taking a morsel of the unparalleled jam.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) held the spoon with her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) thumb and three fingers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) fourth finger,
in matters of honest labour, would never associate with the other
three; delicately curved, it always drew proudly away from them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mentioned that to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines demanded, startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Chetwynd/Miss Aline Chetwynd</b></font>)</div>said Miss Chetwynd. <div class="bookquote">``Several times. Sophia is a very
secretive girl, very--but I think I may say I have always had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
confidence. There have been times when Sophia and I have been very near
each other. Elizabeth was much struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Indeed, I may tell you
that in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) last letters to me she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke of Sophia and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to Mr. Jones, and Mr. Jones remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) quite
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a parent</b></font>)</div><p/>Impossible for even a wise, uncommon parent not to be affected by such
an announcement!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say your sister will give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) school now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs.
Baines, to divert attention from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) self-consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>And this time Mrs. Baines had genuinely shocked Miss Chetwynd.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing would induce Elizabeth to give up the cause of education.
Archibald takes the keenest interest in the school. Oh no! Not for
worlds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``THEN YOU THINK SOPHIA WOULD MAKE A GOOD TEACHER?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Baines
with apparent inconsequence, and with a smile. But the words marked an
epoch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mind. All was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>SOPHIA</b></font>) is very much set on it and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That wouldn't affect her (<font color='blue'><b>SOPHIA</b></font>) father--or me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not! I merely say that she (<font color='blue'><b>SOPHIA</b></font>) is very much set on it. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>SOPHIA</b></font>)
would, at any rate, make a teacher far superior to the average.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``That
girl has got the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother without me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) reflected.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
Here is dear Constance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance, tempted beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) strength by the sounds of the visit and
the colloquy, had slipped into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've left both doors open, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) excused herself for quitting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) father, and kissed Miss Chetwynd.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) blushed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) blushed happily, and really made a most creditable
debut as a young lady. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother rewarded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into the
conversation. And history was soon made.

<p/>So Sophia was apprenticed to Miss Aline Chetwynd. Mrs. Baines bore
herself greatly. It was Miss Chetwynd who had urged, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) respect
for Miss Chetwynd ... Also somehow the Reverend Archibald Jones came
into the cause.

<p/>Of course the idea of Sophia ever going to London was ridiculous,
ridiculous! -LRB-Mrs. Baines secretly feared that the ridiculous might
happen; but, with the Reverend Archibald Jones on the spot, the worst
could be faced.-RRB- Sophia must understand that even the apprenticeship in
Bursley was merely a trial. They would see how things went on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
to thank Miss Chetwynd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made Miss Chetwynd come and talk to mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia
magnificently one night to simple Constance, as if to imply, <div class="bookquote">``Your Miss
Chetwynd is my washpot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>To Constance, Sophia's mere enterprise was just as staggering as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
success. Fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) deliberately going out that Saturday morning, after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's definite decision, to enlist Miss Chetwynd in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) aid!

<p/>There is no need to insist on the tragic grandeur of Mrs. Baines's
renunciation--a renunciation which implied her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) acceptance of a change
in the balance of power in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) realm. Part of its tragedy was that
none, not even Constance, could divine the intensity of Mrs. Baines's
suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had no confidant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was incapable of showing a wound.
But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) lay awake at night by the organism which had once been her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) dwelt long and deeply on the martyrdom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) life. What
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) done to deserve it? Always had she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) conscientiously endeavoured
to be kind, just, patient. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew herself to be sagacious and
prudent. In the frightful and unguessed trials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) existence as a
wife, surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) might have been granted consolations as a mother! Yet
no; it had not been! And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt all the bitterness of age against
youth--youth egotistic, harsh, cruel, uncompromising; youth that is so
crude, so ignorant of life, so slow to understand! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had Constance.
Yes, but it would be twenty years before Constance could appreciate the
sacrifice of judgment and of pride which her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother had made, in a
sudden decision, during that rambling, starched, simpering interview
with Miss Aline Chetwynd. Probably Constance thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had
yielded to Sophia's passionate temper! Impossible to explain to
Constance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had yielded to nothing but a perception of Sophia's
complete inability to hear reason and wisdom. Ah! Sometimes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lay
in the dark, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would, in fancy, snatch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bosom and
fling it down before Sophia, bleeding, and cry: <div class="bookquote">``See what I carry about
with me, on your account!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would take it back and hide it
again, and sweeten her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bitterness with wise admonitions to herself.

<p/>All this because Sophia, aware that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stayed in the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would be compelled to help in the shop, chose an honourable activity
which freed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from the danger. Heart, how absurd of you to bleed!




<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>ELEPHANT

<p/>I


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia, will you come and see the elephant? Do come!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Constance
entered the drawing-room with this request on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eager lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with a touch of condescension. <div class="bookquote">``I'm far too busy for
elephants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Only two years had passed; but both girls were grown up now; long
sleeves, long skirts, hair that had settled down in life; and a
demeanour immensely serious, as though existence were terrific in its
responsibilities; yet sometimes childhood surprisingly broke through
the crust of gravity, as now in Constance, aroused by such things as
elephants, and proclaimed with vivacious gestures that it was not dead
after all. The sisters were sharply differentiated. Constance wore the
black alpaca apron and the scissors at the end of a long black elastic,
which indicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) vocation in the shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was proving a
considerable success in the millinery department. She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had learnt how to
talk to people, and was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) modest way, very self-possessed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
was getting a little stouter. Everybody liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). Sophia had developed
into the student. Time had accentuated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reserve. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sole friend was
Miss Chetwynd, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, having regard to the disparity of
their ages, very intimate. At home she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spoke little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lacked
amiability; as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``touchy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) required
diplomacy from others, but did not render it again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attitude,
indeed, was one of half-hidden disdain, now gentle, now coldly bitter.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not wear an apron, in an age when aprons were almost
essential to decency. No! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not wear an apron, and there was an
end of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not so tidy as Constance, and if Constance's hands
had taken on the coarse texture which comes from commerce with needles,
pins, artificial flowers, and stuffs, Sophia's fine hands were seldom
innocent of ink. But Sophia was splendidly beautiful. And even her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mother and Constance had an instinctive idea that that face was, at any
rate, a partial excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asperity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, <div class="bookquote">``if you won't, I do believe I shall ask mother
if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) books, made no answer. But the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head
said: <div class="bookquote">``This has no interest for me whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance left the room, and in a moment returned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother, with gay excitement, <div class="bookquote">``you might go and sit
with your father for a bit while Constance and I just run up to the
playground to see the elephant. You can work just as well in there as
here. Your father's asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia agreed haughtily. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever is all this fuss
about an elephant? Anyhow, it'll be quieter in your room. The noise
here is splitting.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gave a supercilious glance into the Square as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) languidly rose.

<p/>It was the morning of the third day of Bursley Wakes; not the modern
finicking and respectable, but an orgiastic carnival, gross in all its
manifestations of joy. The whole centre of the town was given over to
the furious pleasures of the people. Most of the Square was occupied by
Wombwell's Menagerie, in a vast oblong tent, whose raging beasts roared
and growled day and night. And spreading away from this supreme
attraction, right up through the market-place past the Town Hall to
Duck Bank, Duck Square and the waste land called the `playground' were
hundreds of booths with banners displaying all the delights of the
horrible. You could see the atrocities of the French Revolution, and of
the Fiji Islands, and the ravages of unspeakable diseases, and the
living flesh of a nearly nude human female guaranteed to turn the scale
at twenty-two stone, and the skeletons of the mysterious phantoscope,
and the bloody contests of champions naked to the waist -LRB-with the
chance of picking up a red tooth as a relic-RRB-. You could try your
strength by hitting an image of a fellow-creature in the stomach, and
test your aim by knocking off the heads of other images with a wooden
ball. You could also shoot with rifles at various targets. All the
streets were lined with stalls loaded with food in heaps, chiefly dried
fish, the entrails of animals, and gingerbread. All the public-houses
were crammed, and frenzied jolly drunkards, men and women, lunged along
the pavements everywhere, their shouts vying with the trumpets, horns,
and drums of the booths, and the shrieking, rattling toys that the
children carried.

<p/>It was a glorious spectacle, but not a spectacle for the leading
families. Miss Chetwynd's school was closed, so that the daughters of
leading families might remain in seclusion till the worst was over. The
Baineses ignored the Wakes in every possible way, choosing that week to
have a show of mourning goods in the left-hand window, and refusing to
let Maggie outside on any pretext. Therefore the dazzling social
success of the elephant, which was quite easily drawing Mrs. Baines
into the vortex, cannot imaginably be over-estimated.

<p/>On the previous night one of the three Wombwell elephants had suddenly
knelt on a man in the tent; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had then walked out of the tent and
picked up another man at haphazard from the crowd which was staring at
the great pictures in front, and tried to put this second man into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mouth. Being stopped by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Indian attendant with a pitchfork, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
placed the man on the ground and stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tusk through an artery of
the victim's arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then, amid unexampled excitement, suffered himself
to be led away. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was conducted to the rear of the tent, just in front
of Baines's shuttered windows, and by means of stakes, pulleys, and
ropes forced to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was whitewashed, and six men of the
Rifle Corps were engaged to shoot at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at a distance of five yards,
while constables kept the crowd off with truncheons. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died instantly,
rolling over with a soft thud. The crowd cheered, and, intoxicated by
their importance, the Volunteers fired three more volleys into the
carcase, and were then borne off as heroes to different inns. The
elephant, by the help of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two companions, was got on to a railway
lorry and disappeared into the night. Such was the greatest sensation
that has ever occurred, or perhaps will ever occur, in Bursley. The
excitement about the repeal of the Corn Laws, or about Inkerman, was
feeble compared to that excitement. Mr. Critchlow, who had been called
on to put a hasty tourniquet round the arm of the second victim, had
popped in afterwards to tell John Baines all about it. Mr. Baines's
interest, however, had been slight. Mr. Critchlow succeeded better with
the ladies, who, though they had witnessed the shooting from the
drawing-room, were thirsty for the most trifling details.

<p/>The next day it was known that the elephant lay near the playground,
pending the decision of the Chief Bailiff and the Medical Officer as to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) burial. And everybody had to visit the corpse. No social
exclusiveness could withstand the seduction of that dead elephant.
Pilgrims travelled from all the Five Towns to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're going now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had assumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bonnet
and shawl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, pretending to be absorbed in study, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
sat on the sofa at the foot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father's bed.

<p/>And Constance, having put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head in at the door, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) like a magnet.

<p/>Then Sophia heard a remarkable conversation in the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going up to see the elephant, Mrs. Baines?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>asked the voice of
Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I had better come with you. The crowd is sure to be very
rough.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey's tone was firm; he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had a position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the shop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall not be long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance added appealingly.

<p/>Sophia felt the house thrill as the side-door banged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sprang up and
watched the three cross King Street diagonally, and so plunge into the
Wakes. This triple departure was surely the crowning tribute to the
dead elephant! It was simply astonishing. It caused Sophia to perceive
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had miscalculated the importance of the elephant. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) scorn of the elephant as an attraction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was left behind;
and the joy of life was calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could see down into the Vaults
on the opposite side of the street, where working men--potters and
colliers--in their best clothes, some with high hats, were drinking,
gesticulating, and laughing in a row at a long counter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) noticed, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was thus at the bedroom window, a young man
ascending King Street, followed by a porter trundling a flat barrow of
luggage. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) passed slowly under the very window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flushed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
evidently been startled by the sight of this young man into no ordinary
state of commotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glanced at the books on the sofa, and then at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father. Mr. Baines, thin and gaunt, and acutely pitiable, still
slept. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) brain had almost ceased to be active now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had to be fed
and tended like a bearded baby, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would sleep for hours at a
stretch even in the daytime. Sophia left the room. A moment later she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
ran into the shop, an apparition that amazed the three young lady
assistants. At the corner near the window on the fancy side a little
nook had been formed by screening off a portion of the counter with
large flower-boxes placed end-up. This corner had come to be known as
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Baines's corner.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia hastened to it, squeezing past a young
lady assistant in the narrow space between the back of the counter and
the shelf-lined wall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat down in Constance's chair and pretended
to look for something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had examined herself in the cheval-glass in
the showroom, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) way from the sick-chamber. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard a voice
near the door of the shop asking first for Mr. Povey and then for Mrs.
Baines, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) rose, and seizing the object nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), which happened
to be a pair of scissors, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hurried towards the showroom stairs as
though the scissors had been a grail, passionately sought and to be
jealously hidden away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wanted to stop and turn round, but something
prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was at the end of the counter, under the curving
stairs, when one of the assistants said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you don't know when Mr. Povey or your mother are likely to
be back, Miss Sophia? Here's--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the assistants</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a divine release for Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're--I--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stammered, turning round abruptly. Luckily she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
still sheltered behind the counter.

<p/>The young man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had seen in the street came boldly forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Miss Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), hat in hand. <div class="bookquote">``It is a long time
since I had the pleasure of seeing you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blushed then. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) scarcely knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) moved slowly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister's corner again, the
young man following her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) on the customer's side of the counter.

<p/>II

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a traveller for the most renowned and gigantic of
all Manchester wholesale firms--Birkinshaws. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
name, which was Gerald Scales. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a rather short but extremely
well-proportioned man of thirty, with fair hair, and a distinguished
appearance, as became a representative of Birkinshaws. His (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) broad, tight
necktie, with an edge of white collar showing above it, was
particularly elegant. He (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) had been on the road for Birkinshaws for
several years; but Sophia had only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) once before in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a little girl, three years ago. The relations between the
travellers of the great firms and their solid, sure clients in small
towns were in those days often cordially intimate. The traveller came
with the lustre of a historic reputation around him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>); there was no need
to fawn for orders; and the client's immense and immaculate
respectability made him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) the equal of no matter what ambassador. It was
a case of mutual esteem, and of that confidence-generating phenomenon,
<div class="bookquote">``an old account.''  (<font color='red'><b>a traveller</b></font>)</div>The tone in which a commercial traveller of middle
age would utter the phrase <div class="bookquote">``an old account''  (<font color='red'><b>a traveller</b></font>)</div>revealed in a flash all
that was romantic, prim, and stately in mid-Victorian commerce. In the
days of Baines, after one of the elaborately engraved advice-circulars
had arrived -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Our Mr. -- will have the pleasure of waiting upon you
on --day next, the -- inst.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>-RRB- John might in certain cases be expected to
say, on the morning of --day, <div class="bookquote">``Missis, what have ye gotten for supper
to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Baines/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gerald Scales had never been asked to supper; he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had never even
seen John Baines; but, as the youthful successor of an aged traveller
who had had the pleasure of St. Luke's Square, on behalf of
Birkinshaws, since before railways, Mrs. Baines had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) with a
faint agreeable touch of maternal familiarity; and, both her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughters
being once in the shop during his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) visit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had on that occasion
commanded the gawky girls to shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>).

<p/>Sophia had never forgotten that glimpse. The young man without a name
had lived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind, brightly glowing, as the very symbol and
incarnation of the masculine and the elegant.

<p/>The renewed sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to have wakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) out of a sleep.
Assuredly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not the same Sophia. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister's chair
in the corner, entrenched behind the perpendicular boxes, playing
nervously with the scissors, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beautiful face was transfigured into
the ravishingly angelic. It would have been impossible for Mr. Gerald
Scales, or anybody else, to credit, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) gazed at those lovely,
sensitive, vivacious, responsive features, that Sophia was not a
character of heavenly sweetness and perfection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was doing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was nothing but the exquisite expression of a deep
instinct to attract and charm. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soul itself emanated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in an
atmosphere of allurement and acquiescence. Could those laughing lips
hang in a heavy pout? Could that delicate and mild voice be harsh?
Could those burning eyes be coldly inimical? Never! The idea was
inconceivable! And Mr. Gerald Scales, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) head over the top of the
boxes, yielded to the spell. Remarkable that Mr. Gerald Scales, with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) experience, should have had to come to Bursley to find the
pearl, the paragon, the ideal! But so it was. They met in an equal
abandonment; the only difference between them was that Mr. Scales, by
force of habit, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it's your wakes here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was polite to the wakes; but now, with the least inflection in the
world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) put the wakes at its proper level in the scheme of things as
a local unimportance! She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) adored him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) for this; she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was athirst for
sympathy in the task of scorning everything local.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect you didn't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) said, implying that there was every
reason why a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mundane interests should not know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have remembered if I had thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I didn't
think. What's this about an elephant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My porter was full of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``of course it's a very big thing in Bursley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) smiled in gentle pity of poor Bursley, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) naturally did the
same. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought how much more advanced and broad the younger
generation was than the old! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never have dared to express his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
real feelings about Bursley to Mrs. Baines, or even to Mr. Povey -LRB-who
was, however, of no generation-RRB-; yet here was a young woman actually
sharing them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) all the history of the elephant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must have been very exciting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) commented, despite himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``it WAS.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After all, Bursley was climbing in their opinion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And mother and my sister and Mr. Povey have all gone to see it. That's
why they're not here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>That the elephant should have caused both Mr. Povey and Mrs. Baines to
forget that the representative of Birkinshaws was due to call was
indeed a final victory for the elephant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But not you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Not me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you go too?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) flattering investigations
with a generous smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I simply didn't care to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), proudly nonchalant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose you are in charge here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I just happened to have run down here for these
scissors. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I often see your sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">''`Often' do I say?--that is,
generally, when I come; but never you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm never in the shop,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's just an accident to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! So you leave the shop to your sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) teaching.

<p/>Then there was a silence. Sophia was very thankful to be hidden from
the curiosity of the shop. The shop could see nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and only
the back of the young man; and the conversation had been conducted in
low voices. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) foot, stared at the worn, polished surface
of the counter, with the brass yard-measure nailed along its edge, and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) uneasily turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze to the left and seemed to be
examining the backs of the black bonnets which were perched on high
stands in the great window. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for an important
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) breathed. Somebody had to say something. If the shop missed
the murmur of their voices the shop would wonder what had happened to
them.

<p/>Mr. Scales looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) watch. '<div class="bookquote">``I dare say if I come in again about
two--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, they're SURE to be in then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) burst out before he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could
finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) sentence.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) left abruptly, queerly, without shaking hands -LRB-but then it would
have been difficult--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) argued--for him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) to have put his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) arm over the
boxes-RRB-, and without expressing the hope of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) peeped
through the black bonnets, and saw the porter put the leather strap
over his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) shoulders, raise the rear of the barrow, and trundle off; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not see Mr. Scales. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was drunk; thoughts were tumbling about
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brain like cargo loose in a rolling ship. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) entire conception
of herself was being altered; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attitude towards life was being
altered. The thought which knocked hardest against its fellows was,
<div class="bookquote">``Only in these moments have I begun to live!''

 (<font color='red'><b>fellows</b></font>)</div><p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flitted upstairs to resume watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sought
to devise an innocent-looking method by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might see Mr. Scales
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) next called. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) speculated as to what his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) name was.

<p/>III

<p/>When Sophia arrived in the bedroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was startled because her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
father's head and beard were not in their accustomed place on the
pillow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could only make out something vaguely unusual sloping off
the side of the bed. A few seconds passed--not to be measured in
time--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that the upper part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) body had slipped down, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head was hanging, inverted, near the floor between the bed and the
ottoman. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, neck, and hands were dark and congested; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mouth
was open, and the tongue protruded between the black, swollen, mucous
lips; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes were prominent and coldly staring. The fact was that Mr.
Baines had wakened up, and, being restless, had slid out partially from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bed and died of asphyxia. After having been unceasingly watched for
fourteen years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had, with an invalid's natural perverseness, taken
advantage of Sophia's brief dereliction to expire. Say what you will,
amid Sophia's horror, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) terrible grief and shame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
visitings of the idea: he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did it on purpose!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ran out of the room, knowing by intuition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was dead, and
shrieked out, <div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) voice; the house echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, quite close, coming out of Mr. Povey's
chamber with a slop-pail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch Mr. Critchlow at once. Be quick. Just as you are. It's father--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, perceiving darkly that disaster was in the air, and instantly
filled with importance and a sort of black joy, dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pail in the
exact middle of the passage, and almost fell down the crooked stairs.
One of Maggie's deepest instincts, always held in check by the stern
dominance of Mrs. Baines, was to leave pails prominent on the main
routes of the house; and now, divining what was at hand, it flamed into
insurrection.

<p/>No sleepless night had ever been so long to Sophia as the three minutes
which elapsed before Mr. Critchlow came. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stood on the mat
outside the bedroom door she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and Constance and
Mr. Povey by magnetic force out of the wakes into the house, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
muscles were contracted in this strange effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that it was
impossible to continue living if the secret of the bedroom remained
unknown one instant longer, so intense was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) torture, and yet that
the torture which could not be borne must be borne. Not a sound in the
house! Not a sound from the shop! Only the distant murmur of the wakes!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did I forget father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked herself with awe. <div class="bookquote">``I only meant to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that they were all out, and run back. Why did I forget
father?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would never be able to persuade anybody that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
literally forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father's existence for quite ten minutes; but
it was true, though shocking.

<p/>Then there were noises downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us! Bless us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>came the unpleasant voice of Mr. Critchlow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
bounded up the stairs on his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) long legs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) strode over the pail.
<div class="bookquote">``What's amiss?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) white apron, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
spectacles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) bony hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's father--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s--''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia faltered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stood away so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) should enter the room first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) glanced at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) keenly, and as it were resentfully, and went in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) followed,
timidly, remaining near the door while Mr. Critchlow inspected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
handiwork. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) spectacles with strange deliberation, and
then, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) knees outwards, thus lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) body so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
could examine John Baines point-blank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) remained staring like this,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) sharp apron-covered knees, for a little space; and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) seized the inert mass and restored it to the bed, and wiped
those clotted lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) apron.

<p/>Sophia heard loud breathing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). It was Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard a
huge, snorting sob; Maggie was showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go fetch doctor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Critchlow rasped. <div class="bookquote">``And don't stand gaping there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Run for the doctor, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How came ye to let him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fall?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Critchlow demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was out of the room. I just ran down into the shop--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gallivanting with that young Scales!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow, with
devilish ferocity. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you've killed yer father; that's all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) must have been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) shop door and seen the entry of the traveller!
And it was precisely characteristic of Mr. Critchlow to jump in the
dark at a horrible conclusion, and to be right after all. For Sophia
Mr. Critchlow had always been the personification of malignity and
malevolence, and now these qualities in him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), almost
obscene. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pride brought up tremendous reinforcements, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
approached the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked in a quiet tone. -LRB-Somewhere within a voice was
whispering, <div class="bookquote">``So his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name is Scales.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pail on the stairs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This mild exclamation came from the passage. Mrs. Baines, misliking the
crowds abroad, had returned alone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had left Constance in charge of
Mr. Povey. Coming into her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) house by the shop and showroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had
first noted the phenomenon of the pail--proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) theory of
Maggie's incurable untidiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Been to see the elephant, I reckon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow, in fierce
sarcasm, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) recognized Mrs. Baines's voice.

<p/>Sophia leaped towards the door, as though to bar her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's entrance.
But Mrs. Baines was already opening the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my pet--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was beginning cheerfully.

<p/>Mr. Critchlow confronted her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had no more pity for the wife than
for the daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was furiously angry because his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) precious property
had been irretrievably damaged by the momentary carelessness of a silly
girl. Yes, John Baines was his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) property, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) dearest toy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was
convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) alone had kept John Baines alive for fourteen years,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) alone had fully understood the case and sympathized with the
sufferer, that none but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been capable of displaying ordinary
common sense in the sick-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had learned to regard John Baines as,
in some sort, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) creation. And now, with their stupidity, their
neglect, their elephants, between them they had done for John Baines.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had always known it would come to that, and it had come to that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fall out o' bed, and ye're a widow now, missis!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
announced with a virulence hardly conceivable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) angular features and
dark eyes expressed a murderous hate for every woman named Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>cried Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``I only ran down into the shop to--to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother's arm in frenzied agony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, rising miraculously to the situation with
a calm benevolence of tone and gesture that remained for ever sublime
in the stormy heart of Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``do not hold me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div>With infinite
gentleness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loosed herself from those clasping hands. <div class="bookquote">``Have you sent
for the doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) questioned Mr. Critchlow.

<p/>The fate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) husband presented no mysteries to Mrs. Baines.
Everybody had been warned a thousand times of the danger of leaving the
paralytic, whose life depended on his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) position, and whose fidgetiness
was thereby a constant menace of death to him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>). For five thousand nights
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had wakened infallibly every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) stirred, and rearranged him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) by
the flicker of a little oil lamp. But Sophia, unhappy creature, had
merely left him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>). That was all.

<p/>Mr. Critchlow and the widow gazed, helplessly waiting, at the pitiable
corpse, of which the salient part was the white beard. They knew not
that they were gazing at a vanished era. John Baines had belonged to
the past, to the age when men really did think of their souls, when
orators by phrases could move crowds to fury or to pity, when no one
had learnt to hurry, when Demos was only turning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sleep, when the
sole beauty of life resided in its inflexible and slow dignity, when
hell really had no bottom, and a gilt-clasped Bible really was the
secret of England's greatness. Mid-Victorian England lay on that
mahogany bed. Ideals had passed away with John Baines. It is thus that
ideals die; not in the conventional pageantry of honoured death, but
sorrily, ignobly, while one's head is turned--

<p/>And Mr. Povey and Constance, very self-conscious, went and saw the dead
elephant, and came back; and at the corner of King Street, Constance
exclaimed brightly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why! who's gone out and left the side-door open?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>For the doctor had at length arrived, and Maggie, in showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
upstairs with pious haste, had forgotten to shut the door.

<p/>And they took advantage of the side-door, rather guiltily, to avoid the
eyes of the shop. They feared that in the parlour they would be the
centre of a curiosity half ironical and half reproving; for had they
not accomplished an escapade? So they walked slowly.

<p/>The real murderer was having his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) dinner in the commercial room up at
the Tiger, opposite the Town Hall.

<p/>IV

<p/>Several shutters were put up in the windows of the shop, to indicate a
death, and the news instantly became known in trading circles
throughout the town. Many people simultaneously remarked upon the
coincidence that Mr. Baines should have died while there was a show of
mourning goods in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) establishment. This coincidence was regarded as
extremely sinister, and it was apparently felt that, for the sake of
the mind's peace, one ought not to inquire into such things too
closely. From the moment of putting up the prescribed shutters, John
Baines and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) funeral began to acquire importance in Bursley, and
their importance grew rapidly almost from hour to hour. The wakes
continued as usual, except that the Chief Constable, upon
representations being made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) by Mr. Critchlow and other citizens,
descended upon St. Luke's Square and forbade the activities of
Wombwell's orchestra. Wombwell and the Chief Constable differed as to
the justice of the decree, but every well-minded person praised the
Chief Constable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) himself considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) had enhanced the
town's reputation for a decent propriety. It was noticed, too, not
without a shiver of the uncanny, that that night the lions and tigers
behaved like lambs, whereas on the previous night they had roared the
whole Square out of its sleep.

<p/>The Chief Constable was not the only individual enlisted by Mr.
Critchlow in the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) friend's fame. Mr. Critchlow spent
hours in recalling the principal citizens to a due sense of John
Baines's past greatness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was determined that his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) treasured toy
should vanish underground with due pomp, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) left nothing undone to
that end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) went over to Hanbridge on the still wonderful horse-car,
and saw the editor-proprietor of the Staffordshire Signal -LRB-then a
two-penny weekly with no thought of Football editions-RRB-, and on the very
day of the funeral the Signal came out with a long and eloquent
biography of John Baines. This biography, giving details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) public
life, definitely restored him (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) legitimate position in the civic
memory as an ex-chief bailiff, an ex-chairman of the Burial Board, and
of the Five Towns Association for the Advancement of Useful Knowledge,
and also as a <div class="bookquote">``prime mover''  (<font color='red'><b>an bailiff</b></font>)</div>in the local Turnpike Act, in the
negotiations for the new Town Hall, and in the Corinthian facade of the
Wesleyan Chapel; it narrated the anecdote of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) courageous speech from
the portico of the Shambles during the riots of 1848, and it did not
omit a eulogy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) steady adherence to the wise old English maxims of
commerce and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) avoidance of dangerous modern methods. Even in the
sixties the modern had reared its shameless head. The panegyric closed
with an appreciation of the dead man's fortitude in the terrible
affliction with which a divine providence had seen fit to try him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and
finally the Signal uttered its absolute conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) native town
would raise a cenotaph to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honour. Mr. Critchlow, being unfamiliar
with the word <div class="bookquote">``cenotaph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>consulted Worcester's Dictionary, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
found that it meant <div class="bookquote">``a sepulchral monument to one who is buried
elsewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was as pleased with the Signal's language as with the
idea, and decided that a cenotaph should come to pass.

<p/>The house and shop were transformed into a hive of preparation for the
funeral. All was changed. Mr. Povey kindly slept for three nights on
the parlour sofa, in order that Mrs. Baines might have his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) room. The
funeral grew into an obsession, for multitudinous things had to be
performed and done sumptuously and in strict accordance with precedent.
There were the family mourning, the funeral repast, the choice of the
text on the memorial card, the composition of the legend on the coffin,
the legal arrangements, the letters to relations, the selection of
guests, and the questions of bell-ringing, hearse, plumes, number of
horses, and grave-digging. Nobody had leisure for the indulgence of
grief except Aunt Maria, who, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had helped in the laying-out,
simply sat down and bemoaned unceasingly for hours her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) absence on the
fatal morning. <div class="bookquote">``If I hadn't been so fixed on polishing my
candle-sticks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) weepingly repeated, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mit ha' been alive and well
now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Not that Aunt Maria had been informed of the precise
circumstances of the death; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was not clearly aware that Mr. Baines
had died through a piece of neglect. But, like Mr. Critchlow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
convinced that there had been only one person in the world truly
capable of nursing Mr. Baines. Beyond the family, no one save Mr.
Critchlow and Dr. Harrop knew just how the martyr had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>)
career. Dr. Harrop, having been asked bluntly if an inquest would be
necessary, had reflected a moment and had then replied: <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Harrop/Harrop</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``Least said soonest mended--mark me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They had marked him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>)
was commonsense in breeches.

<p/>As for Aunt Maria, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was sent about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) snivelling business by Aunt
Harriet. The arrival in the house of this genuine aunt from Axe, of
this majestic and enormous widow whom even the imperial Mrs. Baines
regarded with a certain awe, set a seal of ultimate solemnity on the
whole event. In Mr. Povey's bedroom Mrs. Baines fell like a child into
Aunt Harriet's arms and sobbed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it had been anything else but that elephant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Aunt Harriet</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was Mrs. Baines's sole weakness from first to last.

<p/>Aunt Harriet was an exhaustless fountain of authority upon every detail
concerning interments. And, to a series of questions ending with the
word <div class="bookquote">``sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and answers ending with the word <div class="bookquote">``sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the
prodigious travail incident to the funeral was gradually and
successfully accomplished. Dress and the repast exceeded all other
matters in complexity and difficulty. But on the morning of the funeral
Aunt Harriet had the satisfaction of beholding her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) younger sister the
centre of a tremendous cocoon of crape, whose slightest pleat was
perfect. Aunt Harriet seemed to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) then, like a veteran,
formally into the august army of relicts. As they stood side by side
surveying the special table which was being laid in the showroom for
the repast, it appeared inconceivable that they had reposed together in
Mr. Povey's limited bed. They descended from the showroom to the
kitchen, where the last delicate dishes were inspected. The shop was,
of course, closed for the day, but Mr. Povey was busy there, and in
Aunt Harriet's all-seeing glance he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) came next after the dishes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
rose from the kitchen to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got your boxes of gloves all ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Maddack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not forget to have a measure handy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mrs. Maddack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find you'll want more of seven-and-three-quarters and eights
than anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have allowed for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you place yourself behind the side-door and put your boxes on the
harmonium, you'll be able to catch every one as they come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I had thought of, Mrs. Maddack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) went upstairs. Mrs. Baines had reached the showroom again, and was
smoothing out creases in the white damask cloth and arranging glass
dishes of jam at equal distances from each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maddack. <div class="bookquote">``A last look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>And they passed into the mortuary bedroom to gaze at Mr. Baines before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) should be everlastingly nailed down. In death he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had recovered some
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) earlier dignity; but even so he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was a startling sight. The two
widows bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), one on either side, and gravely stared at that
twisted, worn white face all neatly tucked up in linen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall fetch Constance and Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maddack, with tears in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Do you go into the drawing-room, sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Maddack only succeeded in fetching Constance.

<p/>Then there was the sound of wheels in King Street. The long rite of the
funeral was about to begin. Every guest, after having been measured and
presented with a pair of the finest black kid gloves by Mr. Povey, had
to mount the crooked stairs and gaze upon the carcase of John Baines,
going afterwards to the drawing-room to condole briefly with the widow.
And every guest, while conscious of the enormity of so thinking,
thought what an excellent thing it was that John Baines should be at
last dead and gone. The tramping on the stairs was continual, and
finally Mr. Baines himself went downstairs, bumping against corners,
and led a cortege of twenty vehicles.

<p/>The funeral tea was not over at seven o'clock, five hours after the
commencement of the rite. It was a gigantic and faultless meal, worthy
of John Baines's distant past. Only two persons were absent from
it--John Baines and Sophia. The emptiness of Sophia's chair was much
noticed; Mrs. Maddack explained that Sophia was very high-strung and
could not trust herself. Great efforts were put forth by the company to
be lugubrious and inconsolable, but the secret relief resulting from
the death would not be entirely hidden. The vast pretence of acute
sorrow could not stand intact against that secret relief and the lavish
richness of the food.

<p/>To the offending of sundry important relatives from a distance, Mr.
Critchlow informally presided over that assemblage of grave men in high
stocks and crinolined women. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) shop, which had never
before been closed on a weekday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had a great deal to say about
this extraordinary closure. It was due as much to the elephant as to
the funeral. The elephant had become a victim to the craze for
souvenirs. Already in the night his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) tusks had been stolen; then his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>)
feet disappeared for umbrella-stands, and most of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) flesh had
departed in little hunks. Everybody in Bursley had resolved to
participate in the elephant. One consequence was that all the chemists'
shops in the town were assaulted by strings of boys. <div class="bookquote">``Please a pennorth
o' alum to tak' smell out o' a bit o' elephant.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Critchlow hated
boys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`I'll alum ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>says I, and I did. I alummed him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) out o' my shop with a
pestle. If there'd been one there'd been twenty between opening and
nine o'clock. <div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says to my apprentice, `shut shop up. My old
friend John Baines is going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) long home to-day, and I'll close.
I've had enough o' alum for one day.'''

<p/>The elephant fed the conversation until after the second relay of hot
muffins. When Mr. Critchlow had eaten to his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) capacity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) took the
Signal importantly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) pocket, posed his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) spectacles, and read the
obituary all through in slow, impressive accents. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) reached the
end Mrs. Baines began to perceive that familiarity had blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) to
the heroic qualities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) late husband. The fourteen years of
ceaseless care were quite genuinely forgotten, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
strength and in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) glory. When Mr. Critchlow arrived at the eulogy of
the husband and father, Mrs. Baines rose and left the showroom. The
guests looked at each other in sympathy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). Mr. Critchlow shot a
glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) spectacles and continued steadily reading. After
he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) approached the question of the cenotaph.

<p/>Mrs. Baines, driven from the banquet by her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) feelings, went into the
drawing-room. Sophia was there, and Sophia, seeing tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mother's eyes, gave a sob, and flung herself bodily against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother,
clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face in that broad crape, which abraded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soft skin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wept passionately, <div class="bookquote">``I want to leave the school now. I
want to please you. I'll do anything in the world to please you. I'll
go into the shop if you'd like me to!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) voice lost itself in tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Calm yourself, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, tenderly, caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). It
was a triumph for the mother in the very hour when she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) needed a triumph.




<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>THE TRAVELLER

<p/>I


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Equisite, 1s. 11d.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>These singular signs were being painted in shiny black on an
unrectangular parallelogram of white cardboard by Constance one evening
in the parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was seated, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) left side to the fire and to
the fizzing gas, at the dining-table, which was covered with a checked
cloth in red and white. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) dress was of dark crimson; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wore a cameo
brooch and a gold chain round her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) neck; over her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) shoulders was thrown a
white knitted shawl, for the weather was extremely cold, the English
climate being much more serious and downright at that day than it is
now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bent low to the task, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head slightly askew, putting
the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) tongue between her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) lips, and expending all the energy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) soul and body in an intense effort to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was doing as well
as it could be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/>Mr. Povey was fronting her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) at the table; he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) elbows on the
table, and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) carefully, with the breathless and divine
anxiety of a dreamer who is witnessing the realization of his (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) dream.
And Constance, without moving any part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) frame except her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head,
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) and smiled for a moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
delicious little nostrils at the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) snub nose.

<p/>Those two, without knowing or guessing it, were making history--the
history of commerce. They had no suspicion that they were the forces of
the future insidiously at work to destroy what the forces of the past
had created, but such was the case. They were conscious merely of a
desire to do their duty in the shop and to the shop; probably it had
not even occurred to them that this desire, which each stimulated in
the breast of the other, had assumed the dimensions of a passion. It
was ageing Mr. Povey, and it had made of Constance a young lady
tremendously industrious and preoccupied.

<p/>Mr. Povey had recently been giving attention to the question of
tickets. It is not too much to say that Mr. Povey, to whom heaven had
granted a minimum share of imagination, had nevertheless discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
little parcel of imagination in the recesses of being, and brought it
effectively to bear on tickets. Tickets ran in conventional grooves.
There were heavy oblong tickets for flannels, shirting, and other
stuffs in the piece; there were smaller and lighter tickets for
intermediate goods; and there were diamond-shaped tickets -LRB-containing
nothing but the price-RRB- for bonnets, gloves, and flimflams generally.
The legends on the tickets gave no sort of original invention. The
words <div class="bookquote">``lasting,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``durable,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``unshrinkable,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``latest,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``cheap,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``stylish,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``novelty,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`choice' -LRB-as an adjective-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``new,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``tasteful,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exhausted the entire vocabulary of tickets. Now Mr. Povey
attached importance to tickets, and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was acknowledged to be the
best window-dresser in Bursley, his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) views were entitled to respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
dreamed of other tickets, in original shapes, with original legends. In
brief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) achieved, in regard to tickets, the rare feat of ridding
himself of preconceived notions, and of approaching a subject with
fresh, virginal eyes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) indicated the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wishes to Mr.
Chawner, the wholesale stationer who supplied all the Five Towns with
shop-tickets, Mr. Chawner grew uneasy and worried; Mr. Chawner was
indeed shocked. For Mr. Chawner there had always been certain
well-defined genera of tickets, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chawner</b></font>) could not conceive the existence
of other genera. When Mr. Povey suggested circular tickets--tickets
with a blue and a red line round them, tickets with legends such as
<div class="bookquote">``unsurpassable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>`very dainty,<div class="bookquote">'' or `please note,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Chawner hummed
and hawed, and finally stated that it would be impossible to
manufacture these preposterous tickets, these tickets which would
outrage the decency of trade.

<p/>If Mr. Povey had not happened to be an exceedingly obstinate man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
might have been defeated by the crass Toryism of Mr. Chawner. But Mr.
Povey was obstinate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had resources of ingenuity which Mr.
Chawner little suspected. The great, tramping march of progress was not
to be impeded by Mr. Chawner. Mr. Povey began to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own tickets.
At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) suffered as all reformers and inventors suffer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) used the
internal surface of collar-boxes and ordinary ink and pens, and the
result was such as to give customers the idea that Baineses were too
poor or too mean to buy tickets like other shops. For bought tickets
had an ivory-tinted gloss, and the ink was black and glossy, and the
edges were very straight and did not show yellow between two layers of
white. Whereas Mr. Povey's tickets were of a bluish-white, without
gloss; the ink was neither black nor shiny, and the edges were
amateurishly rough: the tickets had an unmistakable air of having been
`made out of something else'; moreover, the lettering had not the free,
dashing style of Mr. Chawner's tickets.

<p/>And did Mrs. Baines encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Chawner</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chawner</b></font>) single-minded enterprise on
behalf of HER business? Not a bit! Mrs. Baines's attitude, when not
disdainful, was inimical! So curious is human nature, so blind is man
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own advantage! Life was very complex for Mr. Povey. It might
have been less complex had Bristol board and Chinese ink been less
expensive; with these materials he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could have achieved marvels to
silence all prejudice and stupidity; but they were too costly. Still,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) persevered, and Constance morally supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
inspiration and his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) courage from Constance. Instead of the internal
surface of collar-boxes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) tried the external surface, which was at
any rate shiny. But the ink would not `take' on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) made as many
experiments as Edison was to make, and as many failures. Then Constance
was visited by a notion for mixing sugar with ink. Simple, innocent
creature--why should providence have chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to be the vessel of
such a sublime notion? Puzzling enigma, which, however, did not
exercise Mr. Povey! He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) found it quite natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) should save him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).
Save him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) did. Sugar and ink would `take' on anything, and it shone
like a `patent leather' boot. Further, Constance developed a `hand' for
lettering which outdid Mr. Povey's. Between them they manufactured
tickets by the dozen and by the score--tickets which, while possessing
nearly all the smartness and finish of Mr. Chawner's tickets, were much
superior to these in originality and strikingness. Constance and Mr.
Povey were delighted and fascinated by them. As for Mrs. Baines, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
said little, but the modern spirit was too elated by its success to
care whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said little or much. And every few days Mr. Povey
thought of some new and wonderful word to put on a ticket.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) last miracle was the word <div class="bookquote">``exquisite.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exquisite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>pinned on a
piece of broad tartan ribbon, appeared to Constance and Mr. Povey as
the finality of appropriateness. A climax worthy to close the year! Mr.
Povey had cut the card and sketched the word and figures in pencil, and
Constance was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) executive portion of the undertaking. They were
very happy, very absorbed, in this strictly business matter. The clock
showed five minutes past ten. Stern duty, a pure desire for the
prosperity of the shop, had kept them at hard labour since before eight
o'clock that morning!

<p/>The stairs-door opened, and Mrs. Baines appeared, in bonnet and furs
and gloves, all clad for going out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had abandoned the cocoon of
crape, but still wore weeds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was stouter than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Not ready! Now really!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother! How you made me jump!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance protested. <div class="bookquote">``What time is
it? It surely isn't time to go yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the clock!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured, confused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, put your things together, and don't keep me waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Baines, going past the table to the window, and lifting the blind to
peep out. <div class="bookquote">``Still snowing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) observed. ``Oh, the band's going away at
last! I wonder how they can play at all in this weather. By the way,
what was that tune they gave us just now? I couldn't make out whether
it was ``Redhead,<div class="bookquote">'' or--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Band?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>questioned Constance--the simpleton!

<p/>Neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) nor Mr. Povey had heard the strains of the Bursley Town
Silver Prize Band which had been enlivening the season according to its
usual custom. These two practical, duteous, commonsense young and
youngish persons had been so absorbed in their efforts for the welfare
of the shop that they had positively not only forgotten the time, but
had also failed to notice the band! But if Constance had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wits
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would at least have pretended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had heard it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Baines, bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) vast form to the table
and picking up a ticket.

<p/>Mr. Povey said nothing. Constance said: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Povey thought of it
to-day. Don't you think it's very good, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines coldly replied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had mildly objected already to certain words; but `exquisite'
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) silly; it seemed out of place; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) considered that it
would merely bring ridicule on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) shop. ``Exquisite' written upon a
window-ticket! No! What would John Baines have thought of `exquisite'?

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Exquisite!'''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) repeated the word with a sarcastic inflection,
putting the accent, as every one put it, on the second syllable. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't think that will quite do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not suitable, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) dropped the ticket from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) gloved hand. Mr. Povey had darkly
flashed. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) spoke little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was as sensitive as he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was
obstinate. On this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) feelings
by seizing the ticket and throwing it into the fire.

<p/>The situation was extremely delicate. Priceless employes like Mr. Povey
cannot be treated as machines, and Mrs. Baines of course instantly saw
that tact was needed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along to my bedroom and get ready, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) to Constance.
<div class="bookquote">``Sophia is there. There's a good fire. I must just speak to Maggie.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) tactfully left the room.

<p/>Mr. Povey glanced at the fire and the curling red remains of the
ticket. Trade was bad; owing to weather and war, destitution was
abroad; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had been doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) utmost for the welfare of the shop;
and here was the reward!

<p/>Constance's eyes were full of tears. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) murmured, and
went upstairs.

<p/>It was all over in a moment.

<p/>II

<p/>In the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel on Duck Bank there was a full and
influential congregation. For in those days influential people were not
merely content to live in the town where their fathers had lived,
without dreaming of country residences and smokeless air--they were
content also to believe what their fathers had believed about the
beginning and the end of all. There was no such thing as the unknowable
in those days. The eternal mysteries were as simple as an addition sum;
a child could tell you with absolute certainty where you would be and
what you would be doing a million years hence, and exactly what God
thought of you. Accordingly, every one being of the same mind, every
one met on certain occasions in certain places in order to express the
universal mind. And in the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, for example,
instead of a sparse handful of persons disturbingly conscious of being
in a minority, as now, a magnificent and proud majority had collected,
deeply aware of its rightness and its correctness.

<p/>And the minister, backed by minor ministers, knelt and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) face
in the superb mahogany rostrum; and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>), in what was then still
called the `orchestra' -LRB-though no musical instruments except the grand
organ had sounded in it for decades-RRB-, the choir knelt and covered their
faces; and all around in the richly painted gallery and on the
ground-floor, multitudinous rows of people, in easy circumstances of
body and soul, knelt in high pews and covered their faces. And there
floated before them, in the intense and prolonged silence, the clear
vision of Jehovah on a throne, a God of sixty or so with a moustache
and a beard, and a non-committal expression which declined to say
whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would require more bloodshed; and this God, destitute
of pinions, was surrounded by white-winged creatures that wafted
themselves to and fro while chanting; and afar off was an obscene
monstrosity, with cloven hoofs and a tail very dangerous and rude and
interfering, who could exist comfortably in the middle of a coal-fire,
and who took a malignant and exhaustless pleasure in coaxing you by
false pretences into the same fire; but of course you had too much
sense to swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wicked absurdities. Once a year, for ten minutes
by the clock, you knelt thus, in mass, and by meditation convinced
yourself that you had too much sense to swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wicked absurdities.
And the hour was very solemn, the most solemn of all the hours.

<p/>Strange that immortal souls should be found with the temerity to
reflect upon mundane affairs in that hour! Yet there were undoubtedly
such in the congregation; there were perhaps many to whom the vision,
if clear, was spasmodic and fleeting. And among them the inhabitants of
the Baines family pew! Who would have supposed that Mr. Povey, a recent
convert from Primitive Methodism in King Street to Wesleyan Methodism
on Duck Bank, was dwelling upon window-tickets and the injustice of
women, instead of upon his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) relations with Jehovah and the tailed one?
Who would have supposed that the gentle-eyed Constance, pattern of
daughters, was risking her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) eternal welfare by smiling at the tailed
one, who, concealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) tail, had assumed the image of Mr. Povey? Who
would have supposed that Mrs. Baines, instead of resolving that Jehovah
and not the tailed one should have ultimate rule over her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), was
resolving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) and not Mr. Povey should have ultimate rule over her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
house and shop? It was a pew-ful that belied its highly satisfactory
appearance. -LRB-And possibly there were other pew-fuls equally deceptive.-RRB-

<p/>Sophia alone, in the corner next to the wall, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beautiful stern
face pressed convulsively against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hands, was truly busy with
immortal things. Turbulent heart, the violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spiritual life
had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) older! Never was a passionate, proud girl in a harder case
than Sophia! In the splendour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remorse for a fatal forgetfulness,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had renounced that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loved and thrown herself into that
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loathed. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nature so to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had done it
haughtily, and not with kindness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had done it with the whole
force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) will. Constance had been compelled to yield up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the
millinery department, for Sophia's fingers had a gift of manipulating
ribbons and feathers that was beyond Constance. Sophia had accomplished
miracles in the millinery. Yes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would be utterly polite to
customers; but afterwards, when the customers were gone, let mothers,
sisters, and Mr. Poveys beware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fiery darts!

<p/>But why, when nearly three months had elapsed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father's death,
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spent more and more time in the shop, secretly aflame with
expectancy? Why, when one day a strange traveller entered the shop and
announced himself the new representative of Birkinshaws--why had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
very soul died away within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and an awful sickness seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
knew then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own deceiver. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recognized and
admitted, abasing herself lower than the lowest, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) motive in
leaving Miss Chetwynd's and joining the shop had been, at the best,
very mixed, very impure. Engaged at Miss Chetwynd's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) might easily
have never set eyes on Gerald Scales again. Employed in the shop, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
could not fail to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). In this light was to be seen the true
complexion of the splendour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) remorse. A terrible thought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)!
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) could not dismiss it. It contaminated her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) existence, this
thought! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) could confide in no one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was incapable of showing
a wound. Quarter had succeeded quarter, and Gerald Scales was no more
heard of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had sacrificed her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) life for worse than nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) own tragedy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) father, cheated and shamed
herself with a remorse horribly spurious, exchanged content for misery
and pride for humiliation--and with it all, Gerald Scales had vanished!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was ruined.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) took to religion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) conscientious Christian virtues,
practised with stern inclemency, were the canker of the family. Thus a
year and a half had passed.

<p/>And then, on this last day of the year, the second year of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) shame
and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) heart's widowhood, Mr. Scales had reappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had gone
casually into the shop and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) mother and Mr.
Povey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had come back to the provincial round and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) shook
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hand and fled, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) could not have stayed. None had noticed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) agitation, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had held her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) body as in a vice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) knew the
reason neither of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) absence nor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) knew nothing. And
not a word had been said at meals. And the day had gone and the night
come; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was in chapel, with Constance by her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) side and Gerald
Scales in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) soul! Happy beyond previous conception of happiness!
Wretched beyond an unutterable woe! And none knew! What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) to pray
for? To what purpose and end ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) to steel herself? Ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) to
hope, or ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) to despair? <div class="bookquote">``O God, help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) kept whispering to
Jehovah whenever the heavenly vision shone through the wrack of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
meditation. <div class="bookquote">``O God, help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had a conscience that, when it was in
the mood for severity, could be unspeakably cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>).

<p/>And whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) looked, with dry, hot eyes, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) gloved
fingers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) saw in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) on the wall a marble tablet inscribed
in gilt letters, the cenotaph! She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) knew all the lines by heart, in
their spacious grandiloquence; lines such as:

<p/>EVER READY WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) TONGUE HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) PEN AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) PURSE TO HELP THE CHURCH OF
HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) FATHERS IN HER HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) LIVED AND IN HER HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) DIED CHERISHING A DEEP AND
ARDENT AFFECTION FOR HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) BELOVED FAITH AND CREED.

<p/>And again:

<p/>HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) SYMPATHIES EXTENDED BEYOND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) OWN COMMUNITY HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) WAS ALWAYS TO THE
FORE IN GOOD WORKS AND HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) SERVED THE CIRCUIT THE TOWN AND THE DISTRICT
WITH GREAT ACCEPTANCE AND USEFULNESS.

<p/>Thus had Mr. Critchlow's vanity been duly appeased.

<p/>As the minutes sped in the breathing silence of the chapel the
emotional tension grew tighter; worshippers sighed heavily, or called
upon Jehovah for a sign, or merely coughed an invocation. And then at
last the clock in the middle of the balcony gave forth the single
stroke to which it was limited; the ministers rose, and the
congregation after them; and everybody smiled as though it was the
millennium, and not simply the new year, that had set in. Then,
faintly, through walls and shut windows, came the sound of bells and of
steam syrens and whistles. The superintendent minister opened his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>)
hymn-book, and the hymn was sung which had been sung in Wesleyan
Chapels on New Year's morn since the era of John Wesley himself. The
organ finished with a clanguor of all its pipes; the minister had a few
last words with Jehovah, and nothing was left to do except to persevere
in well-doing. The people leaned towards each other across the high
backs of the pews.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A happy New Year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, thank ye! The same to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another Watch Night service over!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And a sigh.

<p/>Then the aisles were suddenly crowded, and there was a good-humoured,
optimistic pushing towards the door. In the Corinthian porch occurred a
great putting-on of cloaks, ulsters, goloshes, and even pattens, and a
great putting-up of umbrellas. And the congregation went out into the
whirling snow, dividing into several black, silent-footed processions,
down Trafalgar Road, up towards the playground, along the market-place,
and across Duck Square in the direction of St. Luke's Square.

<p/>Mr. Povey was between Mrs. Baines and Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must take my arm, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines to Sophia.

<p/>Then Mr. Povey and Constance waded on in front through the drifts.
Sophia balanced that enormous swaying mass, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother. Owing to their
hoops, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had much difficulty in keeping close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Mrs. Baines
laughed with the complacent ease of obesity, yet a fall would have been
almost irremediable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>); and so Sophia had to laugh too. But,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) laughed, God had not helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was going, nor what might happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) next.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, bless us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Baines, as they turned the corner into
King Street. <div class="bookquote">``There's some one sitting on our door-step!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was: a figure swathed in an ulster, a maud over the ulster, and a
high hat on the top of all. It could not have been there very long,
because it was only speckled with snow. Mr. Povey plunged forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Mr. Scales, of all people!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Scales!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Baines.

<p/>And, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Scales!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Sophia, terribly afraid.

<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was afraid of miracles. Mr. Scales sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's
doorstep in the middle of the snowy night had assuredly the air of a
miracle, of something dreamed in a dream, of something pathetically and
impossibly appropriate--<div class="bookquote">``pat,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>as they say in the Five Towns. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
was a tangible fact there. And years afterwards, in the light of
further knowledge of Mr. Scales, Sophia came to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) being on the
doorstep as the most natural and characteristic thing in the world.
Real miracles never seem to be miracles, and that which at the first
blush resembles one usually proves to be an instance of the extremely
prosaic.

<p/>III

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Mrs. Baines?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>asked Gerald Scales, in a half-witted
voice, looking up, and then getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Is this your house?
So it is! Well, I'd no idea I was sitting on your doorstep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) smiled timidly, nay, sheepishly, while the women and Mr. Povey
surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) with their astonished faces under the light of the
gas-lamp. Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was very pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But whatever is the matter, Mr. Scales?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines demanded in an
anxious tone. <div class="bookquote">``Are you ill? Have you been suddenly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man lightly. <div class="bookquote">``It's nothing. Only I was set on
just now, down there,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed to the depths of King Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Set on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines repeated, alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes the fourth case in a week, that we KNOW of!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Povey. <div class="bookquote">``It really is becoming a scandal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was that, owing to depression of trade, lack of employment,
and rigorous weather, public security in the Five Towns was at that
period not as perfect as it ought to have been. In the stress of hunger
the lower classes were forgetting their manners--and this in spite of
the altruistic and noble efforts of their social superiors to relieve
the destitution due, of course, to short-sighted improvidence. When
-LRB-the social superiors were asking in despair-RRB- will the lower classes
learn to put by for a rainy day? -LRB-They might have said a snowy and a
frosty day.-RRB- It was `really too bad' of the lower classes, when
everything that could be done was being done for them, to kill, or even
attempt to kill, the goose that lays the golden eggs! And especially in
a respectable town! What, indeed, were things coming to? Well, here was
Mr. Gerald Scales, gentleman from Manchester, a witness and victim to
the deplorable moral condition of the Five Towns. What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) think
of the Five Towns? The evil and the danger had been a topic of
discussion in the shop for a week past, and now it was brought home to
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you weren't--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, apologetically and
sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Scales interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) quite gaily. <div class="bookquote">``I managed to beat
them off. Only my elbow--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile it was continuing to snow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't think of troubling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales. <div class="bookquote">``I'm all right
now, and I can find my way to the Tiger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come in, if it's only for a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with
decision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had to think of the honour of the town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales.

<p/>The door was suddenly opened from within, and Maggie surveyed them from
the height of the two steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A happy New Year, mum, to all of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, and primly added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The same to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>And in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said that Maggie could best
prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) desire for a happy new year by contriving in future not to
`scamp her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) corners,'' and not to break so much crockery.

<p/>Sophia, scarce knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did, mounted the steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Scales ought to let our New Year in, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines stopped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia concurred with, a gasp, springing back
nervously.

<p/>Mr. Scales raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) hat, and duly let the new year, and much snow,
into the Baines parlour. And there was a vast deal of stamping of feet,
agitating of umbrellas, and shaking of cloaks and ulsters on the
doormat in the corner by the harmonium. And Maggie took away an armful
of everything snowy, including goloshes, and received instructions to
boil milk and to bring <div class="bookquote">``mince.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey said <div class="bookquote">``B-r-r-r!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>and shut the
door -LRB-which was bordered with felt to stop ventilation-RRB-; Mrs. Baines
turned up the gas till it sang, and told Sophia to poke the fire, and
actually told Constance to light the second gas.

<p/>Excitement prevailed.

<p/>The placidity of existence had been agreeably disturbed -LRB-yes,
agreeably, in spite of horror at the attack on Mr. Scales's elbow-RRB- by
an adventure. Moreover, Mr. Scales proved to be in evening-dress. And
nobody had ever worn evening-dress in that house before.

<p/>Sophia's blood was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face, and it remained there, enhancing the
vivid richness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was dizzy with a strange and
disconcerting intoxication. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seemed to be in a world of unrealities
and incredibilities. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ears heard with indistinctness, and the edges
of things and people had a prismatic colouring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in a state of
ecstatic, unreasonable, inexplicable happiness. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) misery, doubts,
despair, rancour, churlishness, had disappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was as softly
gentle as Constance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes were the eyes of a fawn, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gestures
delicious in their modest and sensitive grace. Constance was sitting on
the sofa, and, after glancing about as if for shelter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat down on
the sofa by Constance's side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried not to stare at Mr. Scales, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze would not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was the most perfect
man in the world. A shortish man, perhaps, but a perfect. That such
perfection could be was almost past her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) belief. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excelled all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
dreams of the ideal man. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hair--never were such! Why, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke--it was positively music!
When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled--it was heaven! His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile, to Sophia, was one of those
natural phenomena which are so lovely that they make you want to shed
tears. There is no hyperbole in this description of Sophia's
sensations, but rather an under-statement of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was utterly
obsessed by the unique qualities of Mr. Scales. Nothing would have
persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that the peer of Mr. Scales existed among men, or could
possibly exist. And it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) intense and profound conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
complete pre-eminence that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) sat there in the
rocking-chair in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's parlour, that air of the unreal and the
incredible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stayed in the town on purpose to go to a New Year's party at Mr.
Lawton's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Mr. Scales was saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! So you know Lawyer Lawton!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Baines, impressed, for
Lawyer Lawton did not consort with tradespeople. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) was jolly with
them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) did their legal business for them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) was not of them.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) friends came from afar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My people are old acquaintances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales, sipping the
milk which Maggie had brought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Scales, you must taste my mince. A happy month for every tart
you eat, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) bowed. <div class="bookquote">``And it was as I was coming away from there that I got into
difficulties.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) recounted the struggle, which had, however, been brief, as the
assailants lacked pluck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had slipped and fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) elbow on the
kerb, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) elbow might have been broken, had not the snow been so
thick. No, it did not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) now; doubtless a mere bruise. It was
fortunate that the miscreants had not got the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) pocket-book a considerable sum of money in notes--accounts paid!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had often thought what an excellent thing it would be if commercials
could travel with dogs, particularly in winter. There was nothing like
a dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are fond of dogs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Povey, who had always had a secret
but impracticable ambition to keep a dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales, turning now to Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Povey, in a sporting tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a fox-terrier bitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales, <div class="bookquote">``that took a first at
Knutsford; but she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>)'s getting old now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/>The sexual epithet fell queerly on the room. Mr. Povey, being a man of
the world, behaved as if nothing had happened; but Mrs. Baines's curls
protested against this unnecessary coarseness. Constance pretended not
to hear. Sophia did not understandingly hear. Mr. Scales had no
suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was transgressing a convention by virtue of which
dogs have no sex. Further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had no suspicion of the local fame of
Mrs. Baines's mince-tarts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had already eaten more mince-tarts than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could enjoy, before beginning upon hers, and Mrs. Baines missed the
enthusiasm to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was habituated from consumers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pastry.

<p/>Mr. Povey, fascinated, proceeded in the direction of dogs, and it grew
more and more evident that Mr. Scales, who went out to parties in
evening dress, instead of going in respectable broad-cloth to
watch night-services, who knew the great ones of the land, and who kept
dogs of an inconvenient sex, was neither an ordinary commercial
traveller nor the kind of man to which the Square was accustomed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
came from a different world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lawyer Lawton's party broke up early--at least I mean, considering--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines hesitated.

<p/>After a pause Mr. Scales replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I left immediately the clock
struck twelve. I've a heavy day to-morrow--I mean to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scales</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not an hour for a prolonged visit, and in a few minutes Mr.
Scales was ready again to depart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) admitted a certain feebleness
-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``wankiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) playfully called it, being proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) skill in the
dialect-RRB-, and a burning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) elbow; but otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was quite
well--thanks to Mrs. Baines's most kind hospitality ... He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) really
didn't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) came to be sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) doorstep. Mrs. Baines
urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) met a policeman on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) road to the Tiger, to furnish
all particulars about the attempted highway robbery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
decidedly would.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) leave with distinguished courtliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have a moment I shall run in to-morrow morning just to let you
know I'm all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), in the white street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. Constance's perfect innocence made her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
strangely forward at times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A happy New Year and many of them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks! Same to you! Don't get lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Straight up the Square and first on the right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>called the commonsense
of Mr. Povey.

<p/>Nothing else remained to say, and the visitor disappeared silently in
the whirling snow. <div class="bookquote">``Brrr!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>murmured Mr. Povey, shutting the door.
Everybody felt: <div class="bookquote">``What a funny ending of the old year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines began.

<p/>But Sophia had vanished to bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) new night-dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines to Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I'm so set up with that young man, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Baines reflected aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance protested. <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s just lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never looks you straight in the face,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell ME!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>laughed Constance, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother good night.
<div class="bookquote">``You're only on your high horse because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't praise your mince.
_I_ noticed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>IV

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If anybody thinks I'm going to stand the cold in this showroom any
longer, they're mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia the next morning loudly, and in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's hearing. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went down into the shop carrying bonnets.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pretended to be angry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt, on the contrary,
extremely joyous, and charitable to all the world. Usually she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
take pains to keep out of the shop; usually she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was preoccupied and
stern. Hence her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) presence on the ground-floor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demeanour,
excited interest among the three young lady assistants who sat sewing
round the stove in the middle of the shop, sheltered by the great pile
of shirtings and linseys that fronted the entrance.

<p/>Sophia shared Constance's corner. They had hot bricks under their feet,
and fine-knitted wraps on their shoulders. They would have been more
comfortable near the stove, but greatness has its penalties. The
weather was exceptionally severe. The windows were thickly frosted
over, so that Mr. Povey's art in dressing them was quite wasted.
And--rare phenomenon!--the doors of the shop were shut. In the ordinary
way they were not merely open, but hidden by a display of `cheap
lines.'' Mr. Povey, after consulting Mrs. Baines, had decided to close
them, foregoing the customary display. Mr. Povey had also, in order to
get a little warmth into his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) limbs, personally assisted two casual
labourers to scrape the thick frozen snow off the pavement; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wore
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) kid mittens. All these things together proved better than the
evidence of barometers how the weather nipped.

<p/>Mr. Scales came about ten o'clock. Instead of going to Mr. Povey's
counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) walked boldly to Constance's corner, and looked over the
boxes, smiling and saluting. Both the girls candidly delighted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
visit. Both blushed; both laughed--without knowing why they laughed.
Mr. Scales said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was just departing and had slipped in for a moment
to thank all of them for their kindness of last night--`or rather this
morning.'' The girls laughed again at this witticism. Nothing could have
been more simple than his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) speech. Yet it appeared to them magically
attractive. A customer entered, a lady; one of the assistants rose from
the neighbourhood of the stove, but the daughters of the house ignored
the customer; it was part of the etiquette of the shop that customers,
at any rate chance customers, should not exist for the daughters of the
house, until an assistant had formally drawn attention to them.
Otherwise every one who wanted a pennyworth of tape would be expecting
to be served by Miss Baines, or Miss Sophia, if Miss Sophia were there.
Which would have been ridiculous.

<p/>Sophia, glancing sidelong, saw the assistant parleying with the
customer; and then the assistant came softly behind the counter and
approached the corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Constance, can you spare a minute?''  (<font color='red'><b>the assistant</b></font>)</div>the assistant whispered
discreetly.

<p/>Constance extinguished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smile for Mr. Scales, and, turning away,
lighted an entirely different and inferior smile for the customer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Miss Baines. Very cold, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Mrs. Chatterley. Yes, it is. I suppose you're getting
anxious about those--''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance stopped.

<p/>Sophia was now alone with Mr. Scales, for in order to discuss the
unnameable freely with Mrs. Chatterley her (<font color='blue'><b>Chatterley</b></font>) sister was edging up the
counter. Sophia had dreamed of a private conversation as something
delicious and impossible. But chance had favoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was alone
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). And his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) neat fair hair and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) blue eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) delicate
mouth were as wonderful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was gentlemanly to a degree
that impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) more than anything had impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life.
And all the proud and aristocratic instinct that was at the base of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
character sprang up and seized on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gentlemanliness like a famished
animal seizing on food.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The last time I saw you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales, in a new tone, <div class="bookquote">``you said
you were never in the shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scales</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Yesterday? Did I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I mean the last time I saw you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``It's just an accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's exactly what you said last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Was it his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) manner, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said, that flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), that
intensified her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beautiful vivacity?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you don't often go out?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? In this weather?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I go to chapel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and marketing with mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a
little pause. <div class="bookquote">``And to the Free Library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. You've got a Free Library here now, haven't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We've had it over a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you belong to it? What do you read?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, stories, you know. I get a fresh book out once a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saturdays, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Wednesdays.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Usually.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Wednesday to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Not been already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall go to-day. It's too cold. I
don't think I shall venture out to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be very fond of reading,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/>Then Mr. Povey appeared, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mittened hands. And Mrs.
Chatterley went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll run and fetch mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>Mrs. Baines was very polite to the young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) related his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) interview
with the police, whose opinion was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had been attacked by stray
members of a gang from Hanbridge. The young lady assistants, with ears
cocked, gathered the nature of Mr. Scales's adventure, and were
thrilled to the point of questioning Mr. Povey about it after Mr.
Scales had gone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) farewell was marked by much handshaking, and
finally Mr. Povey ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) into the Square to mention something
about dogs.

<p/>At half-past one, while Mrs. Baines was dozing after dinner, Sophia
wrapped herself up, and with a book under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arm went forth into the
world, through the shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) returned in less than twenty minutes. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother had already awakened, and was hovering about the back of the
shop. Mothers have supernatural gifts.

<p/>Sophia nonchalantly passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and hurried into the parlour where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) muff and a book and knelt before the fire to warm
herself.

<p/>Mrs. Baines followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Been to the Library?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>questioned Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother. And it's simply perishing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder at your going on a day like to-day. I thought you always went
on Thursdays?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do. But I'd finished my book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines picked up the volume, which was covered
with black oil-cloth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) picked it up with a hostile air. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) attitude towards the Free
Library was obscurely inimical. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) never read anything herself except
The Sunday at Home, and Constance never read anything except The Sunday
at Home. There were scriptural commentaries, Dugdale's Gazetteer,
Culpepper's Herbal, and works by Bunyan and Flavius Josephus in the
drawing-room bookcase; also Uncle Tom's Cabin. And Mrs. Baines, in
considering the welfare of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughters, looked askance at the whole
remainder of printed literature. If the Free Library had not formed
part of the Famous Wedgwood Institution, which had been opened with
immense eclat by the semi-divine Gladstone; if the first book had not
been ceremoniously `taken out' of the Free Library by the Chief Bailiff
in person--a grandfather of stainless renown--Mrs. Baines would
probably have risked her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) authority in forbidding the Free Library.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't be afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It's Miss Sewell's
Experience of Life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A novel, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Baines, dropping the book.

<p/>Gold and jewels would probably not tempt a Sophia of these days to read
Experience of Life; but to Sophia Baines the bland story had the
piquancy of the disapproved.

<p/>The next day Mrs. Baines summoned Sophia into her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), trembling, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad if you will not walk
about the streets with young men until you have my permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl blushed violently. <div class="bookquote">``I--I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were seen in Wedgwood Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's been gossiping--Mr. Critchlow, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia exclaimed
scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one has been `gossiping,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if I meet some
one by accident in the street I can't help it, can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia's voice
shook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what I mean, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with careful calm.

<p/>Sophia dashed angrily from the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like the idea of him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) having 'a heavy day'!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines reflected
ironically, recalling a phrase which had lodged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mind. And very
vaguely, with an uneasiness scarcely perceptible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) remembered that
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and no other, had been in the shop on the day her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) husband died.




<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>ESCAPADE

<p/>I


<p/>The uneasiness of Mrs. Baines flowed and ebbed, during the next three
months, influenced by Sophia's moods. There were days when Sophia was
the old Sophia--the forbidding, difficult, waspish, and even hedgehog
Sophia. But there were other days on which Sophia seemed to be drawing
joy and gaiety and goodwill from some secret source, from some fount
whose nature and origin none could divine. It was on these days that
the uneasiness of Mrs. Baines waxed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had the wildest suspicions;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was almost capable of accusing Sophia of carrying on a clandestine
correspondence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw Sophia and Gerald Scales deeply and wickedly in
love; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw them with their arms round each other's necks... And
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) called herself a middle-aged fool, to base such a structure of
suspicion on a brief encounter in the street and on an idea, a fancy, a
curious and irrational notion! Sophia had a certain streak of pure
nobility in that exceedingly heterogeneous thing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) character.
Moreover, Mrs. Baines watched the posts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) also watched
Sophia--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not the woman to trust to a streak of pure
nobility--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) came to be sure that Sophia's sinfulness, if any, was
not such as could be weighed in a balance, or collected together by
stealth and then suddenly placed before the girl on a charger.

<p/>Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have given much to see inside Sophia's lovely head.
Ah! Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) have done so, what sleep-destroying wonders she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
have witnessed! By what bright lamps burning in what mysterious
grottoes and caverns of the brain would her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mature eyes have been
dazzled! Sophia was living for months on the exhaustless ardent
vitality absorbed during a magical two minutes in Wedgwood Street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was living chiefly on the flaming fire struck in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soul by the shock
of seeing Gerald Scales in the porch of the Wedgwood Institution as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
came out of the Free Library with Experience Of Life tucked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
large astrakhan muff. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had stayed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), then: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew it!
<div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart said, <div class="bookquote">``I must be very beautiful, for I have
attracted the pearl of men!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face in the glass.
The value and the power of beauty were tremendously proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>),
the great man of the world, the handsome and elegant man with a
thousand strange friends and a thousand interests far remote from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
had remained in Bursley on the mere chance of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
proud, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pride was drowned in bliss. <div class="bookquote">``I was just looking at this
inscription about Mr. Gladstone.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So you decided to come out as
usual!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And may I ask what book you have chosen?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>These were the
phrases she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard, and to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) responded with similar phrases. And
meanwhile a miracle of ecstasy had opened--opened like a flower. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was walking along Wedgwood Street by his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) side, slowly, on the scraped
pavements, where marble bulbs of snow had defied the spade and
remained. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) were exactly of the same height, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kept
looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) into hers. This was all the miracle.
Except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not walking on the pavement--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was walking on the
intangible sward of paradise! Except that the houses had receded and
faded, and the passers-by were subtilized into unnoticeable ghosts!
Except that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and Constance had become phantasmal beings
existing at an immense distance!

<p/>What had happened? Nothing! The most commonplace occurrence! The
eternal cause had picked up a commercial traveller -LRB-it might have been
a clerk or curate, but it in fact was a commercial traveller-RRB-, and
endowed him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) with all the glorious, unique, incredible attributes of a
god, and planted him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) down before Sophia in order to produce the eternal
effect. A miracle performed specially for Sophia's benefit! No one else
in Wedgwood Street saw the god walking along by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) side. No one else
saw anything but a simple commercial traveller. Yes, the most
commonplace occurrence!

<p/>Of course at the corner of the street he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had to go. <div class="bookquote">``Till next time!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) murmured. And fire came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eyes and lighted in Sophia's
lovely head those lamps which Mrs. Baines was mercifully spared from
seeing. And he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had shaken hands and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) hat. Imagine a god
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) hat! And he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) went off on two legs, precisely like a dashing
little commercial traveller.

<p/>And, escorted by the equivocal Angel of Eclipses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had turned into
King Street, and arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) face, and courageously met her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother had not at first perceived the unusual; for mothers, despite
their reputation to the contrary, really are the blindest creatures.
Sophia, the naive ninny, had actually supposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) walking along a
hundred yards of pavement with a god by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) side was not going to
excite remark! What a delusion! It is true, certainly, that no one saw
the god by direct vision. But Sophia's cheeks, Sophia's eyes, the curve
of Sophia's neck as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soul yearned towards the soul of the god--these
phenomena were immeasurably more notable than Sophia guessed. An
account of them, in a modified form to respect Mrs. Baines's notorious
dignity, had healed the mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blindness and led to that
characteristic protest from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad if you will not walk
about the streets with young men,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>etc..

<p/>When the period came for the reappearance of Mr. Scales, Mrs. Baines
outlined a plan, and when the circular announcing the exact time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
arrival was dropped into the letter-box, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) formulated the plan in
detail. In the first place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was determined to be indisposed and
invisible herself, so that Mr. Scales might be foiled in any possible
design to renew social relations in the parlour. In the second place,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) flattered Constance with a single hint--oh, the vaguest and
briefest!--and Constance understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was not to quit the shop
on the appointed morning. In the third place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) invented a way of
explaining to Mr. Povey that the approaching advent of Gerald Scales
must not be mentioned. And in the fourth place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) deliberately made
appointments for Sophia with two millinery customers in the showroom,
so that Sophia might be imprisoned in the showroom.

<p/>Having thus left nothing to chance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a
foolish woman full of nonsense. But this did not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips together firmly and resolving that Mr. Scales should
have no finger in the pie of HER family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had acquired information
concerning Mr. Scales, at secondhand, from Lawyer Pratt. More than
this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) posed the question in a broader form--why should a young girl
be permitted any interest in any young man whatsoever? The everlasting
purpose had made use of Mrs. Baines and cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) off, and, like most
persons in a similar situation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was, unconsciously and quite
honestly, at odds with the everlasting purpose.

<p/>II

<p/>On the day of Mr. Scales's visit to the shop to obtain orders and money
on behalf of Birkinshaws, a singular success seemed to attend the
machinations of Mrs. Baines. With Mr. Scales punctuality was not an
inveterate habit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had rarely been known, in the past, to fulfil
exactly the prophecy of the letter of advice concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) arrival.
But that morning his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) promptitude was unexampled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) entered the shop,
and by chance Mr. Povey was arranging unshrinkable flannels in the
doorway. The two youngish little men talked amiably about flannels,
dogs, and quarter-day -LRB-which was just past-RRB-, and then Mr. Povey led Mr.
Scales to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) desk in the dark corner behind the high pile of twills,
and paid the quarterly bill, in notes and gold--as always; and then Mr.
Scales offered for the august inspection of Mr. Povey all that
Manchester had recently invented for the temptation of drapers, and Mr.
Povey gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) an order which, if not reckless, was nearer `handsome'
than <div class="bookquote">``good.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>During the process Mr. Scales had to go out of the shop
twice or three times in order to bring in from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) barrow at the
kerb-stone certain small black boxes edged with brass. On none of these
excursions did Mr. Scales glance wantonly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) in satisfaction of
the lust of the eye. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had permitted himself this freedom he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
would have seen nothing more interesting than three young lady
assistants seated round the stove and sewing with pricked fingers from
which the chilblains were at last deciding to depart. When Mr. Scales
had finished writing down the details of the order with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
ivory-handled stylo, and repacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) boxes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) drew the interview to a
conclusion after the manner of a capable commercial traveller; that is
to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) implanted in Mr. Povey his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) opinion that Mr. Povey was a
wise, a shrewd and an upright man, and that the world would be all the
better for a few more like him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) inquired for Mrs. Baines, and was
deeply pained to hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) indisposition while finding consolation in
the assurance that the Misses Baines were well. Mr. Povey was on the
point of accompanying the pattern of commercial travellers to the door,
when two customers simultaneously came in--ladies. One made straight
for Mr. Povey, whereupon Mr. Scales parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) at once, it being a
universal maxim in shops that even the most distinguished commercial
shall not hinder the business of even the least distinguished customer.
The other customer had the effect of causing Constance to pop up from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) cloistral corner. Constance had been there all the time, but of
course, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) heard the remembered voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) maidenliness had not
permitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) should show herself to Mr. Scales.

<p/>Now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was leaving, Mr. Scales saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) agreeable snub
nose and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) kind, simple eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was requesting the second customer
to mount to the showroom, where was Miss Sophia. Mr. Scales hesitated a
moment, and in that moment Constance, catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) eye, smiled upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), and nodded. What else could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) do? Vaguely aware though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother was not `set up' with Mr. Scales, and even feared the
possible influence of the young man on Sophia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not exclude
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) general benevolence towards the universe. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) very much and thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a very fine specimen
of a man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the door and went across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). They shook hands and opened a
conversation instantly; for Constance, while retaining all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) modesty,
had lost all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shyness in the shop, and could chatter with anybody.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sidled towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) corner, precisely as Sophia had done on another
occasion, and Mr. Scales put his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) chin over the screening boxes, and
eagerly prosecuted the conversation.

<p/>There was absolutely nothing in the fact of the interview itself to
cause alarm to a mother, nothing to render futile the precautions of
Mrs. Baines on behalf of the flower of Sophia's innocence. And yet it
held danger for Mrs. Baines, all unconscious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) parlour. Mrs.
Baines could rely utterly on Constance not to be led away by the
dandiacal charms of Mr. Scales -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew in what quarter sat the wind
for Constance-RRB-; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) plan she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had forgotten nothing, except Mr.
Povey; and it must be said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could not possibly have foreseen
the effect on the situation of Mr. Povey's character.

<p/>Mr. Povey, attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) customer, had noticed the bright smile of
Constance on the traveller, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) heart did not like it. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
saw the lively gestures of a Mr. Scales in apparently intimate talk
with a Constance hidden behind boxes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) uneasiness grew into fury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
was a man capable of black and terrible furies. Outwardly
insignificant, possessing a mind as little as his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) body, easily abashed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was none the less a very susceptible young man, soon offended,
proud, vain, and obscurely passionate. You might offend Mr. Povey
without guessing it, and only discover your sin when Mr. Povey had done
something too decisive as a result of it.

<p/>The reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) fury was jealousy. Mr. Povey had made great advances
since the death of John Baines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had consolidated his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) position, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was in every way a personage of the first importance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) misfortune
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could never translate his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) importance, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
importance, into terms of outward demeanour. Most people, had they been
told that Mr. Povey was seriously aspiring to enter the Baines family,
would have laughed. But they would have been wrong. To laugh at Mr.
Povey was invariably wrong. Only Constance knew what inroads he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
effected upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>).

<p/>The customer went, but Mr. Scales did not go. Mr. Povey, free to
reconnoitre, did so. From the shadow of the till he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could catch
glimpses of Constance's blushing, vivacious face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was obviously
absorbed in Mr. Scales. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had a tremendous air of intimacy.
And the murmur of their chatter continued. Their chatter was nothing,
and about nothing, but Mr. Povey imagined that they were exchanging
eternal vows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) endured Mr. Scales's odious freedom until it became
insufferable, until it deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) self-control; and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) retired into his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) cutting-out room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) meditated there in a condition
of insanity for perhaps a minute, and excogitated a device. Dashing
back into the shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) spoke up, half across the shop, in a loud, curt
tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Baines, your mother wants you at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was launched on the phrase before he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) noticed that, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
absence, Sophia had descended from the showroom and joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister
and Mr. Scales. The danger and scandal were now less, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) perceived, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had summoned Constance away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was in a state to
despise consequences.

<p/>The three chatterers, startled, looked at Mr. Povey, who left the shop
abruptly. Constance could do nothing but obey the call.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) at the door of the cutting-out room in the passage leading
to the parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is mother? In the parlour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance inquired innocently.

<p/>There was a dark flush on Mr. Povey's face. <div class="bookquote">``If you wish to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) in a hard voice, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hasn't asked for you and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and retreated into his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began, puzzled.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) fronted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you been gabbling long enough with that
jackanapes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) spit at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). There were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Constance, though without experience in these matters, comprehended.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) comprehended perfectly and immediately. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to have put Mr.
Povey into his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to have protested with firm, dignified
finality against such a ridiculous and monstrous outrage as that which
Mr. Povey had committed. Mr. Povey ought to have been ruined for ever
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) esteem and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And only last Sunday--afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey blubbered.

<p/>-LRB-Not that anything overt had occurred, or been articulately said,
between them last Sunday afternoon. But they had been alone together,
and had each witnessed strange and disturbing matters in the eyes of
the other.-RRB-

<p/>Tears now fell suddenly from Constance's eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to be
ashamed--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stammered.

<p/>Still, the tears were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) too. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
merely said, therefore, was of secondary importance.

<p/>Mrs. Baines, coming from the kitchen, and hearing Constance's voice,
burst upon the scene, which silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). Parents are sometimes
silenced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) found Sophia and Mr. Scales in the shop.

<p/>III

<p/>That afternoon Sophia, too busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own affairs to notice anything
abnormal in the relations between her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and Constance, and quite
ignorant that there had been an unsuccessful plot against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), went
forth to call upon Miss Chetwynd, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had remained very
friendly: she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) and Miss Chetwynd formed an
aristocracy of intellect, and the family indeed tacitly admitted this.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) practised no secrecy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) departure from the shop; she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) merely
dressed, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) second-best hoop, and went, having been ready at any
moment to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) mother, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) mother caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) and inquired, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was going to see Miss Chetwynd. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) did go to see Miss
Chetwynd, arriving at the house-school, which lay amid trees on the
road to Turnhill, just beyond the turnpike, at precisely a quarter-past
four. As Miss Chetwynd's pupils left at four o'clock, and as Miss
Chetwynd invariably took a walk immediately afterwards, Sophia was able
to contain her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) surprise upon being informed that Miss Chetwynd was not
in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had not intended that Miss Chetwynd should be in.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) turned off to the right, up the side road which, starting from the
turnpike, led in the direction of Moorthorne and Red Cow, two mining
villages. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) heart beat with fear as she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) began to follow that road,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was upon a terrific adventure. What most frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>),
perhaps, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) own astounding audacity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was alarmed by something
within herself which seemed to be no part of herself and which produced
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) curious, disconcerting, fleeting impressions of unreality.

<p/>In the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had heard the voice of Mr. Scales from the
showroom--that voice whose even distant murmur caused creepings of the
skin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) back. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had actually stood on the counter in front of
the window in order to see down perpendicularly into the Square; by so
doing she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had had a glimpse of the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) luggage on a barrow, and
of the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hat occasionally when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) went outside to tempt Mr.
Povey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) might have gone down into the shop--there was no slightest
reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) should not; three months had elapsed since the name of
Mr. Scales had been mentioned, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) mother had evidently forgotten
the trifling incident of New Year's Day--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was incapable of
descending the stairs! She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) went to the head of the stairs and peeped
through the balustrade--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) could not get further. For nearly a
hundred days those extraordinary lamps had been brightly burning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
head; and now the light-giver had come again, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) feet would not
move to the meeting; now the moment had arrived for which alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) had
lived, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) could not seize it as it passed! <div class="bookquote">``Why don't I go
downstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) asked herself. <div class="bookquote">``Am I afraid to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The customer</b></font>)</div><p/>The customer sent up by Constance had occupied the surface of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) life
for ten minutes, trying on hats; and during this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) was praying
wildly that Mr. Scales might not go, and asserting that it was
impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) should go without at least asking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>). Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) not
counted the days to this day? When the customer left Sophia followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) downstairs, and saw Mr. Scales chatting with Constance. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
self-possession instantly returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) joined them with a
rather mocking smile. After Mr. Povey's strange summons had withdrawn
Constance from the corner, Mr. Scales's tone had changed; it had
thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it had said, <div class="bookquote">``there is you--and there is
the rest of the universe!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had not forgotten; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had lived in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not for three months been the victim of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own
fancies! ... She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) put a piece of folded white paper on the top
edge of the screening box and flick it down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blushed
scarlet, staring at it as it lay on the counter. He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) said nothing, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not speak... He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had prepared that paper, then, beforehand,
on the chance of being able to give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! This thought was
exquisite but full of terror. <div class="bookquote">``I must really go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had said, lamely,
with emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had gone--like that! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put the
piece of paper into the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) apron, and hastened away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
not even seen, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned up the stairs, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother standing by the
till--that spot which was the conning-tower of the whole shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ran,
ran, breathless to the bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a wicked girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said quite frankly, on the road to the
rendezvous. <div class="bookquote">``It is a dream that I am going to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). It cannot be
true. There is time to go back. If I go back I am safe. I have simply
called at Miss Chetwynd's and she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) wasn't in, and no one can say a word.
But if I go on--if I'm seen! What a fool I am to go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went on, impelled by, amongst other things, an immense, naive
curiosity, and the vanity which the bare fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) note had excited.
The Loop railway was being constructed at that period, and hundreds of
navvies were at work on it between Bursley and Turnhill. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) came
to the new bridge over the cutting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had written
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would be.

<p/>They were very nervous, they greeted each other stiffly and as though
they had met then for the first time that day. Nothing was said about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) note, nor about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) response to it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) presence was treated by
both of them as a basic fact of the situation which it would be well
not to disturb by comment. Sophia could not hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shame, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
shame only aggravated the stinging charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was wearing
a hard Amazonian hat, with a lifted veil, the final word of fashion
that spring in the Five Towns; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face, beaten by the fresh breeze,
shone rosily; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes glittered under the dark hat, and the violent
colours of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) Victorian frock--green and crimson--could not spoil
those cheeks. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked earthwards, frowning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the more
adorable so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had come down the clayey incline from the unfinished
red bridge to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and when the salutations were over they
stood still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gazing apparently at the horizon and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at the yellow
marl round the edges of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) boots. The encounter was as far away from
Sophia's ideal conception as Manchester from Venice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So this is the new railway!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This is your new railway. You can see it better from
the bridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's very sludgy up there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) objected with a pout.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Further on it's quite dry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>From the bridge they had a sudden view of a raw gash in the earth; and
hundreds of men were crawling about in it, busy with minute operations,
like flies in a great wound. There was a continuous rattle of picks,
resembling a muffled shower of hail, and in the distance a tiny
locomotive was leading a procession of tiny waggons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And those are the navvies!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>The unspeakable doings of the navvies in the Five Towns had reached
even her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>): how they drank and swore all day on Sundays, how their huts
and houses were dens of the most appalling infamy, how they were the
curse of a God-fearing and respectable district! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Gerald Scales
glanced down at these dangerous beasts of prey in their yellow
corduroys and their open shirts revealing hairy chests. No doubt they
both thought how inconvenient it was that railways could not be brought
into existence without the aid of such revolting and swinish animals.
They glanced down from the height of their nice decorum and felt the
powerful attraction of similar superior manners. The manners of the
navvies were such that Sophia could not even regard them, nor Gerald
Scales permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to regard them, without blushing.

<p/>In a united blush they turned away, up the gradual slope. Sophia knew
no longer what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was doing. For some minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was as helpless as
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been in a balloon with him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got my work done early,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said; and added complacently, <div class="bookquote">``As a
matter of fact I've had a pretty good day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was reassured to learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was not neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) duties. To be
philandering with a commercial traveller who has finished a good day's
work seemed less shocking than dalliance with a neglecter of business;
it seemed indeed, by comparison, respectable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said primly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, my trade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Always seeing new places and so on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a way it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) admitted judicially. <div class="bookquote">``But I can tell you it was
much more agreeable being in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Have you been to Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lived there for nearly two years,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said carelessly. Then, looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you notice I never came for a long time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you were in Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) evaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to start a sort of agency for Birkinshaws,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you talk French like anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course one has to talk French,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I learnt French when I
was a child from a governess--my uncle made me--but I forgot most of it
at school, and at the Varsity you never learn anything--precious
little, anyhow! Certainly not French!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was deeply impressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was a much greater personage than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
guessed. It had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that commercial travellers had to
go to a university to finish their complex education. And then, Paris!
Paris meant absolutely nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) but pure, impossible,
unattainable romance. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had been there! The clouds of glory were
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was a hero, dazzling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) out of another
world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) miracle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was almost too miraculous to be true.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), living her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) humdrum life at the shop! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), elegant, brilliant,
coming from far cities! They together, side by side, strolling up the
road towards the Moorthorne ridge! There was nothing quite like this in
the stories of Miss Sewell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your uncle...?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) questioned vaguely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Boldero. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)'s a partner in Birkinshaws.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)'s a great Wesleyan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``When we had the Wesleyan Conference here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)'s always very great at Conferences,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald Scales.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) had anything to do with Birkinshaws.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) isn't a working partner of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Scales explained. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)
means me to be one. I have to learn the business from the bottom. So
now you understand why I'm a traveller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) said, still more deeply impressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm an orphan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald. <div class="bookquote">``And Uncle Boldero took me in hand when I
was three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I SEE!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>It seemed strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) that Mr. Scales should be a Wesleyan--just
like herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) would have been sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``Church.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>)
notions of Wesleyanism, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) notions of various other things, were
sharply modified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now tell me about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Mr. Scales suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I'm nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) burst out.

<p/>The exclamation was perfectly sincere. Mr. Scales's disclosures
concerning himself, while they excited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>), discouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the finest girl I've ever met, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales with
gallant emphasis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) dug his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) stick into the soft ground.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) blushed and made no answer.

<p/>They walked on in silence, each wondering apprehensively what might
happen next.

<p/>Suddenly Mr. Scales stopped at a dilapidated low brick wall, built in a
circle, close to the side of the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect that's an old pit-shaft,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I expect it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) picked up a rather large stone and approached the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be careful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) enjoined him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said lightly. <div class="bookquote">``Let's listen. Come near and
listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sewell</b></font>) reluctantly obeyed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) threw the stone over the dirty ruined
wall, the top of which was about level with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) hat. For two or three
seconds there was no sound. Then a faint reverberation echoed from the
depths of the shaft. And on Sophia's brain arose dreadful images of the
ghosts of miners wandering for ever in subterranean passages, far, far
beneath. The noise of the falling stone had awakened for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the secret
terrors of the earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could scarcely even look at the wall without
a spasm of fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Scales, a little awe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) voice, too, <div class="bookquote">``that
that should be left there like that! I suppose it's very deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Scales awe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of them are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) trembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must just have a look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) hands on the top of the
wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! It's all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said again, soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``The wall's as firm as
a rock.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) took a slight spring and looked over.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shrieked loudly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) at the distant bottom of the shaft,
mangled, drowning. The ground seemed to quake under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feet. A
horrible sickness seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shrieked again. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
guessed that existence could be such pain.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) slid down from the wall, and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No bottom to be seen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said. Then, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) transformed face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) came close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
with a superior masculine smile. <div class="bookquote">``Silly little thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said
coaxingly, endearingly, putting forth all his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) power to charm.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) perceived at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had miscalculated the effects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
action. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) alarm changed swiftly to angry offence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) drew back with
a haughty gesture, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had intended actually to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
suppose, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chanced to be walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had the
right to address her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) familiarly, to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) `silly
little thing' and to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) face against hers? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) resented his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
freedom with quick and passionate indignation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) proud back and nodding head and wrathful skirts; and
hurried off without a word, almost running. As for him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was so
startled by unexpected phenomena that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) did nothing for a
moment--merely stood looking and feeling foolish.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) in pursuit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was too proud to stop or even to
reduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) speed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) muttered behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>No recognition from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I ought to apologize,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should just think you ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) answered, furious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do stop a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll thank you not to follow me, Mr. Scales.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paused, and scorched
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) displeasure. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went forward. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart was in
torture because it could not persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>), and smile
and forgive, and win his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall write to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) shouted down the slope.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kept on, the ridiculous child. But the agony she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had suffered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
clung to the frail wall was not ridiculous, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dark vision of the
mine, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tremendous indignation when, after disobeying her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a queen. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the scene was sublimely tragic.
Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had recrossed the bridge, but not the same she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! So this was
the end of the incredible adventure!

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reached the turnpike she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and of
Constance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had completely forgotten them; for a space they had
utterly ceased to exist for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>IV

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been out, Sophia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines in the parlour,
questioningly. Sophia had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hat and mantle hurriedly in the
cutting-out room, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in danger of being late for tea; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
hair and face showed traces of the March breeze. Mrs. Baines, whose
stoutness seemed to increase, sat in the rocking-chair with a number of
The Sunday at Home in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hand. Tea was set.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother. I called to see Miss Chetwynd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd tell me when you are going out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I looked all over for you before I started.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you didn't, for I haven't stirred from this room since four
o'clock... You should not say things like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines added in
a gentler tone.

<p/>Mrs. Baines had suffered much that day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was in an
irritable, nervous state, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said to herself, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
quality of wise woman, <div class="bookquote">``I must watch myself. I mustn't let myself go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) thought how reasonable she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did not guess that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
gestures betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>); nor did it occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) that few things are more
galling than the spectacle of a person, actuated by lofty motives,
obviously trying to be kind and patient under what he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) considers to be
extreme provocation.

<p/>Maggie blundered up the kitchen stairs with the teapot and hot toast;
and so Sophia had an excuse for silence. Sophia too had suffered much,
suffered excruciatingly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) carried at that moment a whole tragedy in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) young soul, unaccustomed to such burdens. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attitude towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mother was half fearful and half defiant; it might be summed up in the
phrase which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had repeated again and again under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) breath on the
way home, <div class="bookquote">``Well, mother can't kill me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines put down the blue-covered magazine and twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
rocking-chair towards the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can pour out the tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Constance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s lying down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was inaccurate. Nearly everything was the matter with Constance,
who had never been less Constance than during that afternoon. But Mrs.
Baines had no intention of discussing Constance's love-affairs with
Sophia. The less said to Sophia about love, the better! Sophia was
excitable enough already!

<p/>They sat opposite to each other, on either side of the fire--the
monumental matron whose black bodice heavily overhung the table, whose
large rounded face was creased and wrinkled by what seemed countless
years of joy and disillusion; and the young, slim girl, so fresh, so
virginal, so ignorant, with all the pathos of an unsuspecting victim
about to be sacrificed to the minotaur of Time! They both ate hot
toast, with careless haste, in silence, preoccupied, worried, and
outwardly nonchalant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what has Miss Chetwynd got to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) wasn't in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was a blow for Mrs. Baines, whose suspicions about Sophia, driven
off by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) certainties regarding Constance, suddenly sprang forward in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind, and prowled to and fro like a band of tigers.

<p/>Still, Mrs. Baines was determined to be calm and careful. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! What
time did you call?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. About half-past four.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tea quickly,
and rose. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell Mr. Povey he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) can come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Mr. Povey had his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) tea after the ladies of the house.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you will stay in the shop till I come. Light me the gas before
you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia took a wax taper from a vase on the mantelpiece, stuck it in the
fire and lit the gas, which exploded in its crystal cloister with a
mild report.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all that clay on your boots, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>repeated Sophia, staring foolishly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) boots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines. <div class="bookquote">``It looks like marl. Where on earth have you
been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) interrogated her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughter with an upward gaze, frigid and
unconsciously hostile, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) gold-rimmed glasses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must have picked it up on the roads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, and hastened to
the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia unwillingly shut the door which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had half opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia obeyed, with falling lip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are deceiving me, Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with fierce
solemnity. <div class="bookquote">``Where have you been this afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia's foot was restless on the carpet behind the table. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't
been anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured glumly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen young Scales?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia with grimness, glancing audaciously for an instant
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) can't kill me: She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) can't kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart
muttered. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had youth and beauty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) favour, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother
was only a fat middle-aged woman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) can't kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart,
with the trembling, cruel insolence of the mirror-flattered child.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How came you to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia, you heard what I said!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Still no answer. Sophia looked down at the table. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) can't kill me.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are going to be sullen, I shall have to suppose the worst,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines.

<p/>Sophia kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines resumed, <div class="bookquote">``if you choose to be wicked, neither
your mother nor any one else can stop you. There are certain things I
CAN do, and these I SHALL do ... Let me warn you that young Scales is a
thoroughly bad lot. I know all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) has been living a wild
life abroad, and if it hadn't been that his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) uncle is a partner in
Birkinshaws, they would never have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) on again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>A pause. <div class="bookquote">``I
hope that one day you will be a happy wife, but you are much too young
yet to be meeting young men, and nothing would ever induce me to let
you have anything to do with this Scales. I won't have it. In future
you are not to go out alone. You understand me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia kept silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will be in a better frame of mind to-morrow. I can only
hope so. But if you aren't, I shall take very severe measures. You
think you can defy me. But you never were more mistaken in your life. I
don't want to see any more of you now. Go and tell Mr. Povey; and call
Maggie for the fresh tea. You make me almost glad that your father died
even as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has, at any rate, been spared this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Those words `died even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did' achieved the intimidation of Sophia.
They seemed to indicate that Mrs. Baines, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had magnanimously
never mentioned the subject to Sophia, knew exactly how the old man had
died. Sophia escaped from the room in fear, cowed. Nevertheless, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thought was, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hasn't killed me. I made up my mind I wouldn't talk,
and I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the evening, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat in the shop primly and sternly sewing at
hats--while her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother wept in secret on the first floor, and Constance
remained hidden on the second--Sophia lived over again the scene at the
old shaft; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lived it differently, admitting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been
wrong, guessing by instinct that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had shown a foolish mistrust of
love. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat in the shop, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) adopted just the right attitude and
said just the right things. Instead of being a silly baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was an
accomplished and dazzling woman, then. When customers came in, and the
young lady assistants unobtrusively turned higher the central gas,
according to the regime of the shop, it was really extraordinary that
they could not read in the heart of the beautiful Miss Baines the words
which blazed there; <div class="bookquote">``YOU'RE THE FINEST GIRL I EVER MET,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``I SHALL
WRITE TO YOU.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>The young lady assistants had their notions as to both
Constance and Sophia, but the truth, at least as regarded Sophia, was
beyond the flight of their imaginations. When eight o'clock struck and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gave the formal order for dust-sheets, the shop being empty, they
never supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was dreaming about posts and plotting how to
get hold of the morning's letters before Mr. Povey.




<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>A DEFEAT

<p/>I


<p/>It was during the month of June that Aunt Harriet came over from Axe to
spend a few days with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) little sister, Mrs. Baines. The railway
between Axe and the Five Towns had not yet been opened; but even if it
had been opened Aunt Harriet would probably not have used it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had
always travelled from Axe to Bursley in the same vehicle, a small
waggonette which she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hired from Bratt's livery stables at Axe, driven
by a coachman who thoroughly understood the importance, and the
peculiarities, of Aunt Harriet.

<p/>Mrs. Baines had increased in stoutness, so that now Aunt Harriet had
very little advantage over her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), physically. But the moral ascendency of
the elder still persisted. The two vast widows shared Mrs. Baines's
bedroom, spending much of their time there in long, hushed
conversations--interviews from which Mrs. Baines emerged with the air
of one who has received enlightenment and Aunt Harriet with the air of
one who has rendered it. The pair went about together, in the shop, the
showroom, the parlour, the kitchen, and also into the town, addressing
each other as <div class="bookquote">``Sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sister.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Everywhere it was <div class="bookquote">``sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``sister,''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>`my sister,<div class="bookquote">'' `your dear mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>`your Aunt Harriet.'' They referred to
each other as oracular sources of wisdom and good taste. Respectability
stalked abroad when they were afoot. The whole Square wriggled uneasily
as though God's eye were peculiarly upon it. The meals in the parlour
became solemn collations, at which shone the best silver and the finest
diaper, but from which gaiety and naturalness seemed to be banished. -LRB-I
say `seemed' because it cannot be doubted that Aunt Harriet was
natural, and there were moments when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) possibly considered herself to
be practising gaiety--a gaiety more desolating than her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) severity.-RRB- The
younger generation was extinguished, pressed flat and lifeless under
the ponderosity of the widows.

<p/>Mr. Povey was not the man to be easily flattened by ponderosity of any
kind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) suppression was a striking proof of the prowess of the
widows; who, indeed, went over Mr. Povey like traction-engines, with
the sublime unconsciousness of traction-engines, leaving an inanimate
object in the road behind them, and scarce aware even of the jolt. Mr.
Povey hated Aunt Harriet, but, lying crushed there in the road, how
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) rebel? He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) felt all the time that Aunt Harriet was adding him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
up, and reporting the result at frequent intervals to Mrs. Baines in
the bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew everything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)--even to those
tears which had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could hope to do
nothing right for Aunt Harriet, that absolute perfection in the
performance of duty would make no more impression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) than a caress
on the fly-wheel of a traction-engine. Constance, the dear Constance,
was also looked at askance. There was nothing in Aunt Harriet's
demeanour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that you could take hold of, but there was
emphatically something that you could not take hold of--a hint, an
inkling, that insinuated to Constance, <div class="bookquote">``Have a care, lest peradventure
you become the second cousin of the scarlet woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia was petted. Sophia was liable to be playfully tapped by Aunt
Harriet's thimble when Aunt Harriet was hemming dusters -LRB-for the
elderly lady could lift a duster to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own dignity-RRB-. Sophia was called
on two separate occasions, <div class="bookquote">``My little butterfly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>And Sophia was
entrusted with the trimming of Aunt Harriet's new summer bonnet. Aunt
Harriet deemed that Sophia was looking pale. As the days passed,
Sophia's pallor was emphasized by Aunt Harriet until it developed into
an article of faith, to which you were compelled to subscribe on pain
of excommunication. Then dawned the day when Aunt Harriet said, staring
at Sophia as an affectionate aunt may: <div class="bookquote">``That child would do with a
change.''  (<font color='red'><b>an aunt</b></font>)</div>And then there dawned another day when Aunt Harriet, staring
at Sophia compassionately, as a devoted aunt may, said: <div class="bookquote">``It's a pity
that child can't have a change.''  (<font color='red'><b>a aunt</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Baines also stared--and said:
<div class="bookquote">``It is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>And on another day Aunt Harriet said: <div class="bookquote">``I've been wondering whether my
little Sophia would care to come and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) old aunt company a while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Aunt Harriet</b></font>)</div><p/>There were few things for which Sophia would have cared less. The girl
swore to herself angrily that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not go, that no allurement
would induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to go. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in a net; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in the meshes of
family correctness. Do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not invent a reason
for not going. Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) aunt that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) merely
did not want to go. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was capable of enormities, but not of that. And
then began Aunt Harriet's intricate preparations for going. Aunt
Harriet never did anything simply. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not be hurried.
Seventy-two hours before leaving she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to commence upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) trunk;
but first the trunk had to be wiped by Maggie with a damp cloth under
the eye and direction of Aunt Harriet. And the liveryman at Axe had to
be written to, and the servants at Axe written to, and the weather
prospects weighed and considered. And somehow, by the time these
matters were accomplished, it was tacitly understood that Sophia should
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kind aunt into the bracing moorland air of Axe. No smoke
at Axe! No stuffiness at Axe! The spacious existence of a wealthy widow
in a residential town with a low death-rate and famous scenery! <div class="bookquote">``Have
you packed your box, Sophia?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had not. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I will come and
help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Impossible to bear up against the momentum of a massive body like Aunt
Harriet's! It was irresistible.

<p/>The day of departure came, throwing the entire household into a
commotion. Dinner was put a quarter of an hour earlier than usual so
that Aunt Harriet might achieve Axe at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) accustomed hour of tea.
After dinner Maggie was the recipient of three amazing muslin aprons,
given with a regal gesture. And the trunk and the box were brought
down, and there was a slight odour of black kid gloves in the parlour.
The waggonette was due and the waggonette appeared -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I can always rely
upon Bladen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Harriet-RRB-, and the door was opened, and Bladen,
stiff on his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) legs, descended from the box and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) hat to Aunt
Harriet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) filled up the doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you baited, Bladen?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>), assuringly.

<p/>Bladen and Mr. Povey carried out the trunk and the box, and Constance
charged herself with parcels which she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) bestowed in the corners of the
vehicle according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) aunt's prescription; it was like stowing the
cargo of a vessel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Sophia, my chuck!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines called up the stairs. And Sophia
came slowly downstairs. Mrs. Baines offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mouth. Sophia glanced
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't think I don't see why you're sending me away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Sophia in a hard, furious voice, with glistening eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not so
blind as all that!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother--nothing but a contemptuous
peck. Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned away she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``But you let Constance do
just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) likes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sole bitter comment on the episode, but into it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put
all the profound bitterness accumulated during many mutinous nights.

<p/>Mrs. Baines concealed a sigh. The explosion certainly disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had hoped that the smooth surface of things would not be ruffled.

<p/>Sophia bounced out. And the assembly, including several urchins,
watched with held breath while Aunt Harriet, after having bid majestic
good-byes, got on to the step and introduced herself through the
doorway of the waggonette into the interior of the vehicle; it was an
operation like threading a needle with cotton too thick. Once within,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoops distended in sudden release, filling the waggonette. Sophia
followed, agilely.

<p/>As, with due formalities, the equipage drove off, Mrs. Baines gave
another sigh, one of relief. The sisters had won. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could now await
the imminent next advent of Mr. Gerald Scales with tranquillity.

<p/>II

<p/>Those singular words of Sophia's, <div class="bookquote">``But you let Constance do just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>had disturbed Mrs. Baines more than was at first apparent. They
worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) like a late fly in autumn. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had said nothing to any
one about Constance's case, Mrs. Maddack of course excepted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) had
instinctively felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) could not show the slightest leniency
towards the romantic impulses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) elder daughter without seeming
unjust to the younger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) had acted accordingly. On the memorable
morn of Mr. Povey's acute jealousy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) had, temporarily at any rate,
slaked the fire, banked it down, and hidden it; and since then no word
had passed as to the state of Constance's heart. In the great peril to
be feared from Mr. Scales, Constance's heart had been put aside as a
thing that could wait; so one puts aside the mending of linen when
earthquake shocks are about. Mrs. Baines was sure that Constance had
not chattered to Sophia concerning Mr. Povey. Constance, who understood
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother, had too much commonsense and too nice a sense of propriety
to do that--and yet here was Sophia exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``But you let Constance
do just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) likes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Were the relations between Constance and Mr.
Povey, then, common property? Did the young lady assistants discuss
them?

<p/>As a fact, the young lady assistants did discuss them; not in the
shop--for either one of the principal parties, or Mrs. Baines herself,
was always in the shop, but elsewhere. They discussed little else, when
they were free; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to-day, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
blushed, and so forth interminably. Yet Mrs. Baines really thought that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) alone knew. Such is the power of the ineradicable delusion that
one's own affairs, and especially one's own children, are mysteriously
different from those of others.

<p/>After Sophia's departure Mrs. Baines surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
manager at supper-time with a curious and a diffident eye. They worked,
talked, and ate just as though Mrs. Baines had never caught them
weeping together in the cutting-out room. They had the most
matter-of-fact air. They might never have heard whispered the name of
love. And there could be no deceit beneath that decorum; for Constance
would not deceive. Still, Mrs. Baines's conscience was unruly. Order
reigned, but nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ought to do something, find
out something, decide something; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ought, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) duty, to
take Constance aside and say: <div class="bookquote">``Now, Constance, my mind is freer now.
Tell me frankly what has been going on between you and Mr. Povey. I
have never understood the meaning of that scene in the cutting-out
room. Tell me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ought to have talked in this strain. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could
not. That energetic woman had not sufficient energy left. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wanted
rest, rest--even though it were a coward's rest, an ostrich's
tranquillity--after the turmoil of apprehensions caused by Sophia. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
soul cried out for peace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not, however, to have peace.

<p/>On the very first Sunday after Sophia's departure, Mr. Povey did not go
to chapel in the morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) offered no reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) unusual
conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) breakfast with appetite, but there was something
peculiar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) glance that made Mrs. Baines a little uneasy; this
something she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could not seize upon and define. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) and Constance
returned from chapel Mr. Povey was playing <div class="bookquote">``Rock of Ages''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>on the
harmonium--again unusual! The serious part of the dinner comprised
roast beef and Yorkshire pudding--the pudding being served as a sweet
course before the meat. Mrs. Baines ate freely of these things, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
loved them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was always hungry after a sermon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) also did well
with the Cheshire cheese. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) intention was to sleep in the
drawing-room after the repast. On Sunday afternoons she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) invariably
tried to sleep in the drawing-room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did not often fail. As a
rule the girls accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) thither from the table, and either
`settled down' likewise or crept out of the room when they perceived
the gradual sinking of the majestic form into the deep hollows of the
easy-chair. Mrs. Baines was anticipating with pleasure her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) somnolent
Sunday afternoon.

<p/>Constance said grace after meat, and the formula on this particular
occasion ran thus--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God for our good dinner, Amen.--Mother, I must just run upstairs
to my room.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>-LRB-``MY room'-Sophia being far away.-RRB-

<p/>And off she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ran, strangely girlish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, child, you needn't be in such a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines,
ringing the bell and rising.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hoped that Constance would remember the conditions precedent to
sleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to have a word with you, if it's all the same to you,
Mrs. Baines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey suddenly, with obvious nervousness. And
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) tone struck a rude unexpected blow at Mrs. Baines's peace of mind.
It was a portentous tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), with an inflection subtly to remind Mr. Povey
what day it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About Constance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the astonishing man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Constance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Baines with a histrionic air of
bewilderment.

<p/>Maggie entered the room, solely in response to the bell, yet a thought
jumped up in Mrs. Baines's brain, <div class="bookquote">``How prying servants are, to be
sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>For quite five seconds she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had a grievance against Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was compelled to sit down again and wait while Maggie cleared the
table. Mr. Povey put both his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) pockets, got up, went to the
window, whistled, and generally behaved in a manner which foretold the
worst.

<p/>At last Maggie vanished, shutting the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Mr. Povey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with absurd nervous brusqueness, as
though pretending: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes! We have something to say--I was
forgetting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) began: <div class="bookquote">``It's about Constance and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, they had evidently plotted this interview. Constance had evidently
taken herself off on purpose to leave Mr. Povey unhampered. They were
in league. The inevitable had come. No sleep! No repose! Nothing but
worry once more!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not at all satisfied with the present situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey,
in a tone that corresponded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean, Mr. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines stiffly. This
was a simple lie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, really, Mrs. Baines!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey protested, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you won't
deny that you know there is something between me and Constance? I
suppose you won't deny that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there between you and Constance? I can assure you I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was nervous
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) manners deteriorated into a behaviour that resembled rudeness.
<div class="bookquote">``That depends on you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) repeated grimly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we to be engaged or are we not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Povey, as though Mrs.
Baines had been guilty of some grave lapse and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was determined not to
spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That's what I think ought to be settled, one way or the
other. I wish to be perfectly open and aboveboard--in the future, as I
have been in the past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have said nothing to me at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines remonstrated,
lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) eyebrows. The way in which the man had sprung this matter
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was truly too audacious.

<p/>Mr. Povey approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sat at the table, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ringlets
and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know there's something between us!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) insisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I know there is something between you? Constance has never
said a word to me. And have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We've hidden nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there between you and Constance? If I may ask!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to be your wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I haven't exactly asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to be my wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``You
see--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) forces. <div class="bookquote">``Have you kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This in a cold
voice.

<p/>Mr. Povey now blushed. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't exactly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) stammered,
apparently shocked by the inquisition. <div class="bookquote">``No, I should not say that I had
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It might have been that before committing himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) felt a desire for
Mrs. Baines's definition of a kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very extraordinary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said loftily. It was no less than the
truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I want to know is--have you got anything against me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) demanded
roughly. <div class="bookquote">``Because if so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything against you, Mr. Povey? Why should I have anything against
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why can't we be engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was bullying her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That's another question,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't we be engaged? Ain't I good enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was not regarded as good enough. Mrs. Maddack had
certainly deemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was not good enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was a solid mass of
excellent qualities; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lacked brilliance, importance, dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
could not impose himself. Such had been the verdict.

<p/>And now, while Mrs. Baines was secretly reproaching Mr. Povey for his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
inability to impose himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was most patently imposing himself on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)--and the phenomenon escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was bullying her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>),
but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could not perceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) power. Yet the man who could
bully Mrs. Baines was surely no common soul!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know my very high opinion of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mr. Povey pursued in a mollified tone. <div class="bookquote">``Assuming that Constance is
willing to be engaged, do I understand you consent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Constance is too young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Constance is twenty. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is more than twenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In any case you won't expect me to give you an answer now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? You know my position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did. From a practical point of view the match would be ideal: no
fault could be found with it on that side. But Mrs. Baines could not
extinguish the idea that it would be a `come-down' for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughter.
Who, after all, was Mr. Povey? Mr. Povey was nobody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must think things over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said firmly, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) lips together.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't reply like this. It is a serious matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When can I have your answer? To-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--really--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a week, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot bind myself to a date,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, haughtily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was gaining ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I can't stay on here indefinitely as things are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey
burst out, and there was a touch of hysteria in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Povey, please do be reasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``That's all very well. But what I
say is that employers have no right to have male assistants in their
houses unless they are prepared to let their daughters marry! That's
what I say! No RIGHT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines did not know what to answer.

<p/>The aspirant wound up: <div class="bookquote">``I must leave if that's the case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If what's the case?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) asked herself. <div class="bookquote">``What has come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And
aloud: <div class="bookquote">``You know you would place me in a very awkward position by
leaving, and I hope you don't want to mix up two quite different
things. I hope you aren't trying to threaten me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Threaten you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I should leave here for fun?
If I leave it will be because I can't stand it. That's all. I can't
stand it. I want Constance, and if I can't have her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), then I can't stand
it. What do you think I'm made of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) almost shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But please let me speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I say is I can't stand it. That's all... Employers have no
right... We have our feelings like other men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was deeply moved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) might have appeared somewhat grotesque to the
strictly impartial observer of human nature. Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was deeply
and genuinely moved, and possibly human nature could have shown nothing
more human than Mr. Povey at the moment when, unable any longer to
restrain the paroxysm which had so surprisingly overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) fled
from the parlour, passionately, to the retreat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the worst of those quiet calm ones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines to
herself. <div class="bookquote">``You never know if they won't give way. And when they do, it's
awful--awful... What did I do, what did I say, to bring it on?
Nothing! Nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And where was her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) afternoon sleep? What was going to happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
daughter? What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) say to Constance? How next could she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) meet Mr.
Povey? Ah! It needed a brave, indomitable woman not to cry out
brokenly: <div class="bookquote">``I've suffered too much. Do anything you like; only let me
die in peace!''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>And so saying, to let everything indifferently slide!

<p/>III

<p/>Neither Mr. Povey nor Constance introduced the delicate subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was determined not to be the first to speak of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
considered that Mr. Povey had taken advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) position, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had also been infantile and impolite. And somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) privately
blamed Constance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) behaviour. So the matter hung, as it were,
suspended in the ether between the opposing forces of pride and passion.

<p/>Shortly afterwards events occurred compared to which the vicissitudes
of Mr. Povey's heart were of no more account than a shower of rain in
April. And fate gave no warning of them; it rather indicated a complete
absence of events. When the customary advice circular arrived from
Birkinshaws, the name of `our Mr. Gerald Scales' was replaced on it by
another and an unfamiliar name. Mrs. Baines, seeing the circular by
accident, experienced a sense of relief, mingled with the professional
disappointment of a diplomatist who has elaborately provided for
contingencies which have failed to happen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had sent Sophia away for
nothing; and no doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) maternal affection had exaggerated a molehill
into a mountain. Really, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) reflected on the past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could not
recall a single fact that would justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) theory of an attachment
secretly budding between Sophia and the young man Scales! Not a single
little fact! All she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could bring forward was that Sophia had twice
encountered Scales in the street.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt a curious interest in the fate of Scales, for whom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own
mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had long prophesied evil, and when Birkinshaws' representative
came she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) took care to be in the shop; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) intention was to converse
with him (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>), and ascertain as much as was ascertainable, after Mr. Povey
had transacted business. For this purpose, at a suitable moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
traversed the shop to Mr. Povey's side, and in so doing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a
fleeting view of King Street, and in King Street of a familiar vehicle.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stopped, and seemed to catch the distant sound of knocking.
Abandoning the traveller, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hurried towards the parlour, in the
passage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) assuredly did hear knocking, angry and impatient knocking,
the knocking of someone who thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) has knocked too long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course Maggie is at the top of the house!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) muttered
sarcastically.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) unchained, unbolted, and unlocked the side-door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>It was Aunt Harriet's voice, exacerbated. <div class="bookquote">``What! You,
sister? You're soon up. What a blessing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>creatures</b></font>)</div><p/>The two majestic and imposing creatures met on the mat, craning forward
so that their lips might meet above their terrific bosoms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines asked, fearfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I do declare!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maddack. <div class="bookquote">``And I've driven specially
over to ask you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Sophia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)'s not come, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Maddack sank down
on to the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)'s not come! What do you
mean, sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) got Constance's letter yesterday, saying you were
ill in bed and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'d better come over to help in the shop, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) started.
I got Bratt's dog-cart for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baines in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) turn also sank down on to the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not been ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And Constance hasn't written for a
week! Only yesterday I was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister--it can't be! Sophia had letters from Constance every morning.
At least she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said they were from Constance. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to be sure and
write me how you were last night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) promised faithfully she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would. And it was because I got nothing by this morning's post that I
decided to come over myself, to see if it was anything serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Serious it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Baines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia's run off. That's the plain English of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines
with frigid calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay! That I'll never believe. I've looked after Sophia night and day
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was my own, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hasn't run off, where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Maddack opened the door with a tragic gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bladen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) called in a loud voice to the driver of the waggonette,
who was standing on the pavement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Pember drove Miss Sophia yesterday, wasn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) hesitated. A clumsy question might enlighten a member of the class
which ought never to be enlightened about one's private affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) didn't come all the way here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No'm. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) happened to say last night when he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) got back as Miss Sophia
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) down at Knype Station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maddack</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maddack, courageously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maddack</b></font>) moaned, after carefully shutting the door.

<p/>They clung to each other.

<p/>The horror of what had occurred did not instantly take full possession
of them, because the power of credence, of imaginatively realizing a
supreme event, whether of great grief or of great happiness, is
ridiculously finite. But every minute the horror grew more clear, more
intense, more tragically dominant over them. There were many things
that they could not say to each other,--from pride, from shame, from
the inadequacy of words. Neither could utter the name of Gerald Scales.
And Aunt Harriet could not stoop to defend herself from a possible
charge of neglect; nor could Mrs. Baines stoop to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sister
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was incapable of preferring such a charge. And the sheer,
immense criminal folly of Sophia could not even be referred to: it was
unspeakable. So the interview proceeded, lamely, clumsily,
inconsequently, leading to naught.

<p/>Sophia was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was gone with Gerald Scales.

<p/>That beautiful child, that incalculable, untamable, impossible
creature, had committed the final folly; without pretext or excuse, and
with what elaborate deceit! Yes, without excuse! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not been
treated harshly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had had a degree of liberty which would have
astounded and shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grandmothers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been petted, humoured,
spoilt. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) answer was to disgrace the family by an act as
irrevocable as it was utterly vicious. If among her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) desires was the
desire to humiliate those majesties, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and Aunt Harriet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would have been content could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) have seen them on the sofa there,
humbled, shamed, mortally wounded! Ah, the monstrous Chinese cruelty of
youth!

<p/>What was to be done? Tell dear Constance? No, this was not, at the
moment, an affair for the younger generation. It was too new and raw
for the younger generation. Moreover, capable, proud, and experienced
as they were, they felt the need of a man's voice, and a man's hard,
callous ideas. It was a case for Mr. Critchlow. Maggie was sent to
fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>), with a particular request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) should come to the
side-door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) came expectant, with the pleasurable anticipation of
disaster, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was not disappointed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) passed with the sisters the
happiest hour that had fallen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) for years. Quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) arranged the
alternatives for them. Would they tell the police, or would they take
the risks of waiting? They shied away, but with fierce brutality he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
brought them again and again to the immediate point of decision...
Well, they could not tell the police! They simply could not. Then they
must face another danger... He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had no mercy for them. And while he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was
torturing them there arrived a telegram, despatched from Charing Cross,
<div class="bookquote">``I am all right, Sophia.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That proved, at any rate, that the child was
not heartless, not merely careless.

<p/>Only yesterday, it seemed to Mrs. Baines, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had borne Sophia; only
yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a baby, a schoolgirl to be smacked. The years rolled
up in a few hours. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was sending telegrams from a place
called Charing Cross! How unlike was the hand of the telegram to
Sophia's hand! How mysteriously curt and inhuman was that official
hand, as Mrs. Baines stared at it through red, wet eyes!

<p/>Mr. Critchlow said some one should go to Manchester, to ascertain about
Scales. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) went himself, that afternoon, and returned with the news
that an aunt of Scales had recently died, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) twelve thousand
pounds, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had, after quarrelling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) uncle Boldero,
abandoned Birkinshaws at an hour's notice and vanished with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
inheritance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as plain as a pikestaff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow. <div class="bookquote">``I could ha' warned
ye o' all this years ago, even since she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Critchlow left nothing unsaid.

<p/>During the night Mrs. Baines lived through all Sophia's life, lived
through it more intensely than ever Sophia had done.

<p/>The next day people began to know. A whisper almost inaudible went
across the Square, and into the town: and in the stillness every one
heard it. <div class="bookquote">``Sophia Baines run off with a commercial!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In another fortnight a note came, also dated from London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Mother, I am married to Gerald Scales. Please don't worry about
me. We are going abroad. Your affectionate Sophia. Love to Constance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No tear-stains on that pale blue sheet! No sign of agitation!

<p/>And Mrs. Baines said: <div class="bookquote">``My life is over.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>It was, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was
scarcely fifty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) felt old, old and beaten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had fought and been
vanquished. The everlasting purpose had been too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). Virtue
had gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)--the virtue to hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head and look the Square
in the face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), the wife of John Baines! She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), a Syme of Axe!

<p/>Old houses, in the course of their history, see sad sights, and never
forget them! And ever since, in the solemn physiognomy of the triple
house of John Baines at the corner of St. Luke's Square and King
Street, have remained the traces of the sight it saw on the morning of
the afternoon when Mr. and Mrs. Povey returned from their
honeymoon--the sight of Mrs. Baines getting into the waggonette for
Axe; Mrs. Baines, encumbered with trunks and parcels, leaving the scene
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) struggles and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) defeat, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had once come as slim as a
wand, to return stout and heavy, and heavy-hearted, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) childhood;
content to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) grandiose sister until such time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) should
be ready for burial! The grimy and impassive old house perhaps heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) heart saying: <div class="bookquote">``Only yesterday they were little girls, ever so tiny,
and now--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The driving-off of a waggonette can be a dreadful thing.




<p/>BOOK II

<p/>CONSTANCE




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>REVOLUTION

<p/>I


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, rising from the rocking-chair that in a
previous age had been John Baines's, <div class="bookquote">``I've got to make a start some
time, so I may as well begin now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Baines/John</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) went from the parlour into the shop. Constance's eye followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) as far as the door, where their glances met for an instant in the
transient gaze which expresses the tenderness of people who feel more
than they kiss.

<p/>It was on the morning of this day that Mrs. Baines, relinquishing the
sovereignty of St. Luke's Square, had gone to live as a younger sister
in the house of Harriet Maddack at Axe. Constance guessed little of the
secret anguish of that departure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) only knew that it was just like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother, having perfectly arranged the entire house for the arrival
of the honeymoon couple from Buxton, to flit early away so as to spare
the natural blushing diffidence of the said couple. It was like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
mother's commonsense and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother's sympathetic comprehension.
Further, Constance did not pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother's feelings, being far too
busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sat there full of new knowledge and new
importance, brimming with experience and strange, unexpected
aspirations, purposes, yes--and cunnings! And yet, though the very
curves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cheeks seemed to be mysteriously altering, the old
Constance still lingered in that frame, an innocent soul hesitating to
spread its wings and quit for ever the body which had been its home;
you could see the timid thing peeping wistfully out of the eyes of the
married woman.

<p/>Constance rang the bell for Maggie to clear the table; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had the illusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not really a married woman and a
house-mistress, but only a kind of counterfeit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did most fervently
hope that all would go right in the house--at any rate until she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
grown more accustomed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) situation.

<p/>The hope was to be disappointed. Maggie's rather silly, obsequious
smile concealed but for a moment the ineffable tragedy that had lain in
wait for unarmed Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) crushed cups together
on the tin tray with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) great, red hands, which always looked like
something out of a butcher's shop; then a pause, <div class="bookquote">``Will you please
accept of this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a butcher</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, before the wedding Maggie had already, with tears of affection,
given Constance a pair of blue glass vases -LRB-in order to purchase which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been obliged to ask for special permission to go out-RRB-, and
Constance wondered what was coming now from Maggie's pocket. A small
piece of folded paper came from Maggie's pocket. Constance accepted of
it, and read: <div class="bookquote">``I begs to give one month's notice to leave. Signed
Maggie. June 10, 1867.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old Constance, terrified by this incredible
occurrence, ere the married woman could strangle her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never give notice before, Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``so I don't know
as I know how it ought for be done--not rightly. But I hope as you'll
accept of it, Mrs. Povey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Povey, primly, just as if Maggie was not the
central supporting pillar of the house, just as if Maggie had not
assisted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) birth, just as if the end of the world had not abruptly
been announced, just as if St. Luke's Square were not inconceivable
without Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``But why--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, Mrs. Povey, I've been a-thinking it over in my kitchen, and I
said to myself: ``If there's going to be one change there'd better be
two,<div class="bookquote">'' I says. Not but what I wouldn't work my fingers to the bone for
ye, Miss Constance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Maggie began to cry into the tray.

<p/>Constance looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Despite the special muslin of that day she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
traces of the slatternliness of which Mrs. Baines had never been able
to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was over forty, big, gawky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had no figure, no
charms of any kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was what was left of a woman after twenty-two
years in the cave of a philanthropic family. And in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) cave she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had
actually been thinking things over! Constance detected for the first
time, beneath the dehumanized drudge, the stirrings of a separate and
perhaps capricious individuality. Maggie's engagements had never been
real to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) employers. Within the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never been, in
practice, anything but ``Maggie'--an organism. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
permitting herself ideas about changes!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll soon be suited with another, Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``There's
many a--many a--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) burst into sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you really want to leave, what are you crying for, Maggie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Povey, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wisest. <div class="bookquote">``Have you told mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie whimpered, absently wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wrinkled cheeks with
ineffectual muslin. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't seem to fancy telling your mother. And
as you're the mistress now, I thought as I'd save it for you when you
come home. I hope you'll excuse me, Mrs. Povey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm very sorry. You've been a very good servant. And in
these days--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child had acquired this turn of speech from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother. It did not
appear to occur to either of them that they were living in the sixties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you thinking of doing, Maggie? You know you won't get
many places like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell ye the truth, Mrs. Povey, I'm going to get married mysen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>murmured Constance, with the perfunctoriness of habit in
replying to these tidings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but I am, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>Maggie insisted. <div class="bookquote">``It's all settled. Mr. Hollins,
mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Hollins, the fish-hawker!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum. I seem to fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>). You don't remember as him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) and me was
engaged in '48. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) was my first, like. I broke it off because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) was in
that Chartist lot, and I knew as Mr. Baines would never stand that. Now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)'s asked me again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)'s been a widower this long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope you'll be happy, Maggie. But what about his (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) habits?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) won't have no habits with me, Mrs. Povey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div><p/>A woman was definitely emerging from the drudge.

<p/>When Maggie, having entirely ceased sobbing, had put the folded cloth
in the table-drawer and departed with the tray, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mistress became
frankly the girl again. No primness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood alone there
in the parlour; no pretence that Maggie's notice to leave was an
everyday document, to be casually glanced at--as one glances at an
unpaid bill! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would be compelled to find a new servant, making
solemn inquiries into character, and to train the new servant, and to
talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from heights from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never addressed Maggie. At
that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had an illusion that there were no other available,
suitable servants in the whole world. And the arranged marriage? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
felt that this time--the thirteenth or fourteenth time--the engagement
was serious and would only end at the altar. The vision of Maggie and
Hollins at the altar shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Marriage was a series of phenomena,
and a general state, very holy and wonderful--too sacred, somehow, for
such creatures as Maggie and Hollins. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) vague, instinctive revolt
against such a usage of matrimony centred round the idea of a strong,
eternal smell of fish. However, the projected outrage on a hallowed
institution troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) much less than the imminent problem of
domestic service.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ran into the shop--or she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have run if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
girlishness betimes--and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips, ready to be whispered importantly
into a husband's astounded ear, were the words, <div class="bookquote">``Maggie has given
notice! Yes! Truly!''  (<font color='red'><b>a husband</b></font>)</div>But Samuel Povey was engaged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was leaning over
the counter and staring at an outspread paper upon which a certain Mr.
Yardley was making strokes with a thick pencil. Mr. Yardley, who had a
long red beard, painted houses and rooms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) only by sight.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) always associated him (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) with the sign over his (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) premises
in Trafalgar Road, <div class="bookquote">``Yardley Bros., Authorised plumbers. Painters.
Decorators. Paper-hangers. Facia writers.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>For years, in childhood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had passed that sign without knowing what sort of things <div class="bookquote">``Bros,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
``Facia' were, and what was the mysterious similarity between a plumber
and a version of the Bible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could not interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
wholly absorbed; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stay in the shop -LRB-which appeared just a
little smaller than usual-RRB-, for that would have meant an unsuccessful
endeavour to front the young lady-assistants as though nothing in
particular had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went sedately up the showroom
stairs and thus to the bedroom floors of the house--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) house! Mrs.
Povey's house! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) even climbed to Constance's old bedroom; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother
had stripped the bed--that was all, except a slight diminution of this
room, corresponding to that of the shop! Then to the drawing-room. In
the recess outside the drawing-room door the black box of silver plate
still lay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother to take it; but no! Assuredly
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother was one to do things handsomely--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did them. In the
drawing-room, not a tassel of an antimacassar touched! Yes, the
fire-screen, the luscious bunch of roses on an expanse of mustard,
which Constance had worked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother years ago, was gone! That her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mother should have clung to just that one souvenir, out of all the
heavy opulence of the drawing-room, touched Constance intimately. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
perceived that if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must write to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat down at the oval table and wrote, <div class="bookquote">``Darling
mother, I am sure you will be very surprised to hear... She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) means
it... I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is making a serious mistake. Ought I to put an
advertisement in the Signal, or will it do if... Please write by
return. We are back and have enjoyed ourselves very much. Sam says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
enjoys getting up late...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And so on to the last inch of the fourth
scolloped page.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was obliged to revisit the shop for a stamp, stamps being kept in
Mr. Povey's desk in the corner--a high desk, at which you stood. Mr.
Povey was now in earnest converse with Mr. Yardley at the door, and
twilight, which began a full hour earlier in the shop than in the
Square, had cast faint shadows in corners behind counters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you just run out with this to the pillar, Miss Dadd?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure, Mrs. Povey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) conversation to
stop the flying girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)'s just going to the post for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance called out from the
region of the till.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! All right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A trifle! A nothing! Yet somehow, in the quiet customerless shop, the
episode, with the scarce perceptible difference in Samuel's tone at his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
second remark, was delicious to Constance. Somehow it was the REAL
beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wifehood. -LRB-There had been about nine other real
beginnings in the past fortnight.-RRB-

<p/>Mr. Povey came in to supper, laden with ledgers and similar works which
Constance had never even pretended to understand. It was a sign from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) that the honeymoon was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was proprietor now, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ardour
for ledgers most justifiable. Still, there was the question of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) exclaimed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) all about the end of the
world. A `never' which expressed extreme astonishment and the liveliest
concern!

<p/>But Constance had anticipated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would have been just a little
more knocked down, bowled over, staggered, stunned, flabbergasted. In a
swift gleam of insight she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been in danger of
forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) role of experienced, capable married woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to set about getting a fresh one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said hastily, with
an admirable assumption of light and easy casualness.

<p/>Mr. Povey seemed to think that Hollins would suit Maggie pretty well.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) made no remark to the betrothed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) answered the final bell of
the night.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) ledgers, whistling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall go up, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I've a lot of things to
put away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Call out when you've done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) cried from the top of the crooked stairs.

<p/>No answer. The door at the foot was closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Distantly, faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done all I'm going to do to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) ran back along the corridor, a white figure in the deep gloom,
and hurried into bed, and drew the clothes up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) chin.

<p/>In the life of a bride there are some dramatic moments. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) has
married the industrious apprentice, one of those moments occurs when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) first occupies the sacred bed-chamber of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) ancestors, and the bed
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) was born. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) parents' room had always been to Constance,
if not sacred, at least invested with a certain moral solemnity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>)
could not enter it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) would enter another room. The course of
nature, with its succession of deaths, conceptions, and births, slowly
makes such a room august with a mysterious quality which interprets the
grandeur of mere existence and imposes itself on all. Constance had the
strangest sensations in that bed, whose heavy dignity of ornament
symbolized a past age; sensations of sacrilege and trespass, of being a
naughty girl to whom punishment would accrue for this shocking freak.
Not since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was quite tiny had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slept in that bed--one night with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's seizure, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been away. What a
limitless, unfathomable bed it was then! Now it was just a bed--so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had to tell herself--like any other bed. The tiny child that, safely
touching its mother, had slept in the vast expanse, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) now a
pathetic little thing; its image made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feel melancholy. And her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind
dwelt on sad events: the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father, the flight of darling
Sophia; the immense grief, and the exile, of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) esteemed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew what life was, and that it was grim. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sighed. But
the sigh was an affectation, meant partly to convince herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was grown-up, and partly to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in countenance in the intimidating
bed. This melancholy was factitious, was less than transient foam on
the deep sea of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) joy. Death and sorrow and sin were dim shapes to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); the ruthless egoism of happiness blew them away with a puff, and
their wistful faces vanished. To see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) there in the bed, framed in
mahogany and tassels, lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) side, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) young glowing cheeks,
and honest but not artless gaze, and the rich curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hip lifting
the counterpane, one would have said that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never heard of aught
but love.

<p/>Mr. Povey entered, the bridegroom, quickly, firmly, carrying it off
rather well, but still self-conscious. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) shoulders were
trying to say, <div class="bookquote">``what's the difference between this bedroom and the
bedroom of a boarding-house? Indeed, ought we not to feel more at home
here? Besides, confound it, we've been married a fortnight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it give you a funny feeling, sleeping in this room? It does
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. Women, even experienced women, are so foolishly
frank. They have no decency, no self-respect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Povey, with loftiness, as who should say: <div class="bookquote">``What
an extraordinary thing that a reasonable creature can have such
fancies! Now to me this room is exactly like any other room.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
added aloud, glancing away from the glass, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was unfastening his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
necktie: <div class="bookquote">``It's not a bad room at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This, with the judicial air of
an auctioneer.

<p/>Not for an instant did he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) deceive Constance, who read his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) real
sensations with accuracy. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) futile poses did not in the slightest
degree lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). On the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) the
more for them; they were a sort of embroidery on the solid stuff of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
character. At that period he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could not do wrong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). The basis of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) often thought, his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) honesty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) industry,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) genuine kindliness of act, his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) grasp of the business, his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
perseverance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) passion for doing at once that which had to be done.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had the greatest admiration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) qualities, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
eyes an indivisible whole; she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could not admire one part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) and
frown upon another. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did was good because he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
knew that some people were apt to smile at certain phases of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
individuality; she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) knew that far down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mother's heart was a
suspicion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had married ever so little beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). But this
knowledge did not disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had no doubt as to the correctness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own estimate.

<p/>Mr. Povey was an exceedingly methodical person, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was also one of
those persons who must always be `beforehand' with time. Thus at night
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) raiment so that in the morning it might be
reassumed in the minimum of minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was not a man, for example, to
leave the changing of studs from one shirt to another till the morrow.
Had it been practicable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would have brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hair the night
before. Constance already loved to watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) meticulous preparations.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) now go into his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) old bedroom and return with a paper collar,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) put on the dressing-table next to a black necktie. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
shop-suit was laid out on a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sam!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) exclaimed impulsively, <div class="bookquote">``you surely aren't going to begin
wearing those horrid paper collars again!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>During the honeymoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
worn linen collars.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) tone was perfectly gentle, but the remark, nevertheless, showed a
lack of tact. It implied that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) life Mr. Povey had been
enveloping his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) neck in something which was horrid. Like all persons
with a tendency to fall into the ridiculous, Mr. Povey was exceedingly
sensitive to personal criticisms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) flushed darkly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know they were `horrid,'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) snapped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was hurt and angry.
Anger had surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) unawares.

<p/>Both of them suddenly saw that they were standing on the edge of a
chasm, and drew back. They had imagined themselves to be wandering
safely in a flowered meadow, and here was this bottomless chasm! It was
most disconcerting.

<p/>Mr. Povey's hand hovered undecided over the collar. <div class="bookquote">``However--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
muttered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was trying with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) might to be gentle and
pacific. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was aghast at her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own stupid clumsiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) so
experienced!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you like, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) best to smile, and went off gawkily with the
collar and came back with a linen one.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) passion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) burned stronger than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) knew then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) good qualities, but for something boyish and
naive that there was about him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), an indescribable something that
occasionally, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) face was close to hers, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dizzy.

<p/>The chasm had disappeared. In such moments, when each must pretend not
to have seen or even suspected the chasm, small-talk is essential.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't that Mr. Yardley in the shop to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>began Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>)'s going to paint us a signboard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Useless for Samuel to make-believe that nothing in this world is more
ordinary than a signboard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>murmured Constance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said no more, the episode of the paper
collar having weakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) self-confidence.

<p/>But a signboard!

<p/>What with servants, chasms, and signboards, Constance considered that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) life as a married woman would not be deficient in excitement. Long
afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) fell asleep, thinking of Sophia.

<p/>III

<p/>A few days later Constance was arranging the more precious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
wedding presents in the parlour; some had to be wrapped in tissue and
in brown paper and then tied with string and labelled; others had
special cases of their own, leather without and velvet within. Among
the latter was the resplendent egg-stand holding twelve silver-gilt
egg-cups and twelve chased spoons to match, presented by Aunt Harriet.
In the Five Towns' phrase, `it must have cost money.'' Even if Mr. and
Mrs. Povey had ten guests or ten children, and all the twelve of them
were simultaneously gripped by a desire to eat eggs at breakfast or
tea--even in this remote contingency Aunt Harriet would have been
pained to see the egg-stand in use; such treasures are not designed for
use. The presents, few in number, were mainly of this character,
because, owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother's heroic cession of the entire interior,
Constance already possessed every necessary. The fewness of the
presents was accounted for by the fact that the wedding had been
strictly private and had taken place at Axe. There is nothing like
secrecy in marriage for discouraging the generous impulses of one's
friends. It was Mrs. Baines, abetted by both the chief parties, who had
decided that the wedding should be private and secluded. Sophia's
wedding had been altogether too private and secluded; but the casting
of a veil over Constance's -LRB-whose union was irreproachable-RRB- somehow
justified, after the event, the circumstances of Sophia's, indicating
as it did that Mrs. Baines believed in secret weddings on principle. In
such matters Mrs. Baines was capable of extraordinary subtlety.

<p/>And while Constance was thus taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wedding presents with due
seriousness, Maggie was cleaning the steps that led from the pavement
of King Street to the side-door, and the door was ajar. It was a fine
June morning.

<p/>Suddenly, over the sound of scouring, Constance heard a dog's low growl
and then the hoarse voice of a man:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mester in, wench?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happen he (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) is, happen he (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>came Maggie's answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had no fancy
for being called wench.

<p/>Constance went to the door, not merely from curiosity, but from a
feeling that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) authority and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) responsibilities as house-mistress
extended to the pavement surrounding the house.

<p/>The famous James Boon, of Buck Row, the greatest dog-fancier in the
Five Towns, stood at the bottom of the steps: a tall, fat man, clad in
stiff, stained brown and smoking a black clay pipe less than three
inches long. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attended two bull-dogs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Morning, missis!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boon</b></font>)</div>cried Boon, cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``I've heerd tell as th'
mister is looking out for a dog, as you might say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't stay here with them animals a-sniffing at me--no, that I
don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>observed Maggie, picking herself up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance hesitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew that Samuel had vaguely referred
to dogs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not, however, imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) regarded a dog as aught
but a beautiful dream. No dog had ever put paw into that house, and it
seemed impossible that one should ever do so. As for those beasts of
prey on the pavement...!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>James Boon/Boon</b></font>)</div>said James Boon, calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) you're here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't know if he (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>)'s
at liberty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yardley</b></font>) seldom is at this time of day. Maggie, you'd better come
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went slowly to the shop, full of fear for the future.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, who was writing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) desk,
<div class="bookquote">``here's a man come to see you about a dog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Assuredly he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was taken aback. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) behaved with much presence of
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, about a dog! Who is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's that Jim Boon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>)'s heard you want one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim Boon</b></font>)</div><p/>The renowned name of Jim Boon gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>) pause; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>) had to go through
with the affair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>) went through with it, though nervously.
Constance followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) agitated footsteps to the side-door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Morning, Boon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Morning, master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>They began to talk dogs, Mr. Povey, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) part, with due caution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, there's a dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>James Boon/Boon</b></font>)</div>said Boon, pointing to one of the bull-dogs, a
miracle of splendid ugliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>responded Mr. Povey, insincerely. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>) is a beauty. What's it
worth now, at a venture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tak' a hundred and twenty sovereigns for her (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Boon</b></font>)</div>said Boon. <div class="bookquote">``Th'
other's a bit cheaper--a hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>gasped Constance.

<p/>And even Mr. Povey nearly lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) nerve. <div class="bookquote">``That's more than I want to
give,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Boon</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boon</b></font>)</div>Boon persisted, roughly snatching up the more
expensive animal, and displaying her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) cannibal teeth.

<p/>Mr. Povey shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) head. Constance glanced away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not quite the sort of dog I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fox-terrier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's more like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey agreed eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What'll ye run to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, largely, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will ye run to a tenner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of something cheaper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, hoo much? Out wi' it, mester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not more than two pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would have said one
pound had he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dared. The prices of dogs amazed him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thowt it was a dog as ye wanted!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boon</b></font>)</div>said Boon. <div class="bookquote">``Look `ere, mester.
Come up to my yard and see what I've got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And bring missis along too. Now, what about a cat for th' missis? Or a
gold-fish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The end of the episode was that a young lady aged some twelve months
entered the Povey household on trial. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exiguous legs twinkled all
over the parlour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had the oddest appearance in the parlour. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so confiding, so affectionate, so timorous, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) black nose
was so icy in that hot weather, that Constance loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) violently
within an hour. Mr. Povey made rules for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must never, never go into the shop. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) whipped
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to the squealing point, and Constance cried an instant, while
admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's firmness.

<p/>The dog was not all.

<p/>On another day Constance, prying into the least details of the parlour,
discovered a box of cigars inside the lid of the harmonium, on the
keyboard. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so unaccustomed to cigars that at first she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not
realize what the object was. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father had never smoked, nor drunk
intoxicants; nor had Mr. Critchlow. Nobody had ever smoked in that
house, where tobacco had always been regarded as equally licentious
with cards, `the devil's playthings.<div class="bookquote">'' Certainly Samuel had never smoked
in the house, though the sight of the cigar-box reminded Constance of
an occasion when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother had announced an incredulous suspicion that
Mr. Povey, fresh from an excursion into the world on a Thursday
evening, `smelt of smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) closed the harmonium and kept silence.

<p/>That very night, coming suddenly into the parlour, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) caught Samuel at
the harmonium. The lid went down with a resonant bang that awoke
sympathetic vibrations in every corner of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance inquired, jumping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Povey, carelessly. Each was deceiving the
other: Mr. Povey hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) crime, and Constance hid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
crime. False, false! But this is what marriage is.

<p/>And the next day Constance had a visit in the shop from a possible new
servant, recommended to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by Mr. Holl, the grocer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you please step this way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, with affable primness,
steeped in the novel sense of what it is to be the sole responsible
mistress of a vast household. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) preceded the girl to the parlour, and
as they passed the open door of Mr. Povey's cutting-out room, Constance
had the clear vision and titillating odour of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) husband smoking a
cigar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) shirt-sleeves, calmly cutting out, and Fan -LRB-the
lady companion-RRB-, at watch on the bench, yapped at the possible new
servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall try that girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to Samuel at tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said
nothing as to the cigar; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>).

<p/>On the following evening, after supper, Mr. Povey burst out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll have a weed! You didn't know I smoked, did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus Mr. Povey came out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) true colours as a blood, a blade, and a
gay spark.

<p/>But dogs and cigars, disconcerting enough in their degree, were to the
signboard, when the signboard at last came, as skim milk is to hot
brandy. It was the signboard that, more startlingly than anything else,
marked the dawn of a new era in St. Luke's Square. Four men spent a day
and a half in fixing it; they had ladders, ropes, and pulleys, and two
of them dined on the flat lead roof of the projecting shop-windows. The
signboard was thirty-five feet long and two feet in depth; over its
centre was a semicircle about three feet in radius; this semicircle
bore the legend, judiciously disposed, <div class="bookquote">``S. Povey. Late.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All the
sign-board proper was devoted to the words, <div class="bookquote">``John Baines,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in gold
letters a foot and a half high, on a green ground.

<p/>The Square watched and wondered; and murmured: <div class="bookquote">``Well, bless us! What
next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div><p/>It was agreed that in giving paramount importance to the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
late father-in-law, Mr. Povey had displayed a very nice feeling.

<p/>Some asked with glee: <div class="bookquote">``What'll the old lady have to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance asked herself this, but not with glee. When Constance walked
down the Square homewards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could scarcely bear to look at the sign;
the thought of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mother might say frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mother's
first visit of state was imminent, and Aunt Harriet was to accompany
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Constance felt almost sick as the day approached. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) faintly
hinted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) apprehensions to Samuel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) demanded, as if surprised--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you mentioned it in one of your letters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh NO!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), with bravado, <div class="bookquote">``I'll write and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>IV

<p/>So that Mrs. Baines was duly apprised of the signboard before her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
arrival. The letter written by her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) to Constance after receiving
Samuel's letter, which was merely the amiable epistle of a son-in-law
anxious to be a little more than correct, contained no reference to the
signboard. This silence, however, did not in the least allay
Constance's apprehensions as to what might occur when her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother and
Samuel met beneath the signboard itself. It was therefore with a
fearful as well as an eager, loving heart that Constance opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
side-door and ran down the steps when the waggonette stopped in King
Street on the Thursday morning of the great visit of the sisters. But a
surprise awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). Aunt Harriet had not come. Mrs. Baines explained,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) soundly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughter, that at the last moment Aunt
Harriet had not felt well enough to undertake the journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
fondest love, and cake. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pains had recurred. It was these mysterious
pains which had prevented the sisters from coming to Bursley earlier.
The word <div class="bookquote">``cancer'' (<font color='red'><b>stout women</b></font>)</div>--the continual terror of stout women--had been on
their lips, without having been actually uttered; then there was a
surcease, and each was glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had refrained from the dread
syllables. In view of the recurrence, it was not unnatural that Mrs.
Baines's vigorous cheerfulness should be somewhat forced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance inquired.

<p/>Mrs. Baines pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) lips out and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) eyebrows--a gesture
which meant that the pains might mean God knew what.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll be all right alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>observed Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Of course,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, quickly. <div class="bookquote">``But you don't suppose I was going to
disappoint you, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) added, looking round as if to defy the
fates in general.

<p/>This speech, and its tone, gave intense pleasure to Constance; and,
laden with parcels, they mounted the stairs together, very content with
each other, very happy in the discovery that they were still mother and
daughter, very intimate in an inarticulate way.

<p/>Constance had imagined long, detailed, absorbing, and highly novel
conversations between herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother upon this their first
meeting after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marriage. But alone in the bedroom, and with a clear
half-hour to dinner, they neither of them seemed to have a great deal
to impart.

<p/>Mrs. Baines slowly removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) light mantle and laid it with
precautions on the white damask counterpane. Then, fingering her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) weeds,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) glanced about the chamber. Nothing was changed. Though Constance
had, previous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) marriage, envisaged certain alterations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had
determined to postpone them, feeling that one revolutionist in a house
was enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my chick, you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines, with hearty and
direct energy, gazing straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughter's eyes.

<p/>Constance perceived that the question was universal in its
comprehensiveness, the one unique expression that the mother would give
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) maternal concern and curiosity, and that it condensed into six
words as much interest as would have overflowed into a whole day of the
chatter of some mothers. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) met the candid glance, flushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh YES!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered with ecstatic fervour. <div class="bookquote">``Perfectly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mrs. Baines nodded, as if dismissing THAT. <div class="bookquote">``You're stouter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), curtly. <div class="bookquote">``If you aren't careful you'll be as big as any of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The interview fell to a lower plane of emotion. It even fell as far as
Maggie. What chiefly preoccupied Constance was a subtle change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother fussy in trifles. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) manner of laying
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mantle, of smoothing out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gloves, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anxiety that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
bonnet should not come to harm, were rather trying, were perhaps, in
the very slightest degree, pitiable. It was nothing; it was barely
perceptible, and yet it was enough to alter Constance's mental attitude
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Poor dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>thought Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not
what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Incredible that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother could have aged in less than
six weeks! Constance did not allow for the chemistry that had been
going on in herself.

<p/>The encounter between Mrs. Baines and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) son-in-law was of the most
satisfactory nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was waiting in the parlour for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) to descend.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) made himself exceedingly agreeable, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), and flattering her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) evidently sincere desire to please. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
kept an eye open for the waggonette, but had been called away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>on learning about Aunt Harriet lacked nothing in conviction,
though both women knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) affection for Aunt Harriet would never
get the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) reason. To Constance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) husband's behaviour was
marvellously perfect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to be such a man of the
world. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eyes said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother, quite unconsciously: <div class="bookquote">``You see,
after all, you didn't rate Sam as high as you ought to have done. Now
you see your mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>As they sat waiting for dinner, Constance and Mrs. Baines on the sofa,
and Samuel on the edge of the nearest rocking-chair, a small scuffling
noise was heard outside the door which gave on the kitchen steps, the
door yielded to pressure, and Fan rushed importantly in, deranging
mats. Fan's nose had been hinting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was behind the times,
not up-to-date in the affairs of the household, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had hurried
from the kitchen to make inquiries. It occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) en route that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been washed that morning. The spectacle of Mrs. Baines stopped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) stood, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) legs slightly out-stretched, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) nose lifted,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ears raking forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bright eyes blinking, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) tail
undecided. <div class="bookquote">``I was sure I'd never smelt anything like that before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
was saying to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) stared at Mrs. Baines.

<p/>And Mrs. Baines, staring at Fan, had a similar though not the same
sentiment. The silence was terrible. Constance took on the mien of a
culprit, and Sam had obviously lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) easy bearing of a man of the
world. Mrs. Baines was merely thunderstruck.

<p/>A dog!

<p/>Suddenly Fan's tail began to wag more quickly; and then, having looked
in vain for encouragement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) master and mistress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) gave one
mighty spring and alighted in Mrs. Baines's lap. It was an aim she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
could not have missed. Constance emitted an <div class="bookquote">``Oh, FAN!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>of shocked
terror, and Samuel betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) nervous tension by an involuntary
movement. But Fan had settled down into that titanic lap as into
heaven. It was a greater flattery than Mr. Povey's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So your name's Fan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Baines, stroking the animal. <div class="bookquote">``You
are a dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, with inconceivable rapidity.

<p/>The danger was past. Thus, without any explanation, Fan became an
accepted fact.

<p/>The next moment Maggie served the Yorkshire pudding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baines. <div class="bookquote">``So you are going to get married this
time? When is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sunday, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you leave here on Saturday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must have a talk with you before I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>During the dinner, not a word as to the signboard! Several times the
conversation curved towards that signboard in the most alarming
fashion, but invariably it curved away again, like a train from another
train when two trains are simultaneously leaving a station. Constance
had frights, so serious as to destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) anxiety about the cookery. In
the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) comprehended that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother had adopted a silently
disapproving attitude. Fan was socially very useful throughout the
repast.

<p/>After dinner Constance was on pins lest Samuel should light a cigar.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had not requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) not to do so, for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was entirely
sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) affection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had already learned that a husband is
possessed by a demon of contrariety which often forces him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to violate
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) higher feelings. However, Samuel did not light a cigar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) went off
to superintend the shutting-up of the shop, while Mrs. Baines chatted
with Maggie and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) L5 for a wedding present. Then Mr. Critchlow
called to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) salutations.

<p/>A little before tea Mrs. Baines announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would go out for a
short walk by herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where has she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gone to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>smiled Samuel, superiorly, as with Constance
at the window he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) turn down King Street towards the church.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has gone to look at father's grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>muttered Samuel, apologetically.

<p/>Constance was mistaken. Before reaching the church, Mrs. Baines
deviated to the right, got into Brougham Street and thence, by Acre
Lane, into Oldcastle Street, whose steep she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) climbed. Now, Oldcastle
Street ends at the top of St. Luke's Square, and from the corner Mrs.
Baines had an excellent view of the signboard. It being Thursday
afternoon, scarce a soul was about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughter's by
the same extraordinary route, and said not a word on entering. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
was markedly cheerful.

<p/>The waggonette came after tea, and Mrs. Baines made her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) final
preparations to depart. The visit had proved a wonderful success; it
would have been utterly perfect if Samuel had not marred it at the very
door of the waggonette. Somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) contrived to be talking of
Christmas. Only a person of Samuel's native clumsiness would have
mentioned Christmas in July.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you'll spend Christmas with us!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) into the waggonette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I shan't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Baines. <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Harriet and I will expect
you at Axe. We've already settled that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Povey bridled. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) protested, hurt by this summariness.

<p/>Having had no relatives, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) cousin the confectioner, for many
years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had dreamt of at last establishing a family Christmas under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own roof, and the dream was dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Baines said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``We couldn't possibly leave the shop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines retorted, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) lips together. <div class="bookquote">``Christmas
Day is on a Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The waggonette in starting jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head towards the door and set all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) curls shaking. No white in those curls yet, scarcely a touch of
grey!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take good care we don't go there anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey mumbled,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) heat, half to himself and half to Constance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had stained the brightness of the day.




<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>CHRISTMAS AND THE FUTURE

<p/>I


<p/>Mr. Povey was playing a hymn tune on the harmonium, it having been
decided that no one should go to chapel. Constance, in mourning, with a
white apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) dress, sat on a hassock in front of the fire; and
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), in a rocking-chair, Mrs. Baines swayed very gently to and
fro. The weather was extremely cold. Mr. Povey's mittened hands were
blue and red; but, like many shopkeepers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had apparently grown
almost insensible to vagaries of temperature. Although the fire was
immense and furious, its influence, owing to the fact that the
mediaeval grate was designed to heat the flue rather than the room,
seemed to die away at the borders of the fender. Constance could not
have been much closer to it without being a salamander. The era of good
old-fashioned Christmases, so agreeably picturesque for the poor, was
not yet at an end.

<p/>Yes, Samuel Povey had won the battle concerning the locus of the family
Christmas. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had received the help of a formidable ally, death.
Mrs. Harriet Maddack had passed away, after an operation, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
house and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) money to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sister. The solemn rite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) interment had
deeply affected all the respectability of the town of Axe, where the
late Mr. Maddack had been a figure of consequence; it had even shut up
the shop in St. Luke's Square for a whole day. It was such a funeral as
Aunt Harriet herself would have approved, a tremendous ceremonial which
left on the crushed mind an ineffaceable, intricate impression of shiny
cloth, crape, horses with arching necks and long manes, the drawl of
parsons, cake, port, sighs, and Christian submission to the inscrutable
decrees of Providence. Mrs. Baines had borne herself with unnatural
calmness until the funeral was over: and then Constance perceived that
the remembered mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) girlhood existed no longer. For the
majority of human souls it would have been easier to love a virtuous
principle, or a mountain, than to love Aunt Harriet, who was assuredly
less a woman than an institution. But Mrs. Baines had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been the one person to whom Mrs. Baines looked for support and
guidance. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) died, Mrs. Baines paid the tribute of respect with
the last hoarded remains of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) proud fortitude, and weepingly
confessed that the unconquerable had been conquered, the inexhaustible
exhausted; and became old with whitening hair.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had persisted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) refusal to spend Christmas in Bursley, but
both Constance and Samuel knew that the resistance was only formal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
soon yielded. When Constance's second new servant took it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head
to leave a week before Christmas, Mrs. Baines might have pointed out
the finger of Providence at work again, and this time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) favour.
But no! With amazing pliancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) should bring one of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own servants to `tide Constance over' Christmas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was met with
all the forms of loving solicitude, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daughter and
son-in-law had `turned out of' the state bedroom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) favour.
Intensely flattered by this attention -LRB-which was Mr. Povey's
magnanimous idea-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) nevertheless protested strongly. Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
`would not hear of it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mother, don't be silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance had said firmly. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
expect us to be at all the trouble of moving back again, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>And
Mrs. Baines had surrendered in tears.

<p/>Thus had come Christmas. Perhaps it was fortunate that, the Axe servant
being not quite the ordinary servant, but a benefactor where a
benefactor was needed, both Constance and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother thought it well to
occupy themselves in household work, `sparing' the benefactor as much
as possible. Hence Constance's white apron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, still playing, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) eye on the
street.

<p/>Constance sprang up eagerly. Then there was a knock on the door.
Constance opened, and an icy blast swept into the room. The postman
stood on the steps, his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) instrument for knocking -LRB-like a drumstick-RRB- in
one hand, a large bundle of letters in the other, and a yawning bag
across the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas, ma'am!''  (<font color='red'><b>the postman</b></font>)</div>cried the postman, trying to keep warm by
cheerfulness.

<p/>Constance, taking the letters, responded, while Mr. Povey, playing the
harmonium with his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) right hand, drew half a crown from his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) pocket with
the left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said, giving it to Constance, who gave it to the
postman.

<p/>Fan, who had been keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) muzzle warm with the extremity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
tail on the sofa, jumped down to superintend the transaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brrr!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>vibrated Mr. Povey as Constance shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What lots!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance exclaimed, rushing to the fire. <div class="bookquote">``Here, mother!
Here, Sam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl had resumed possession of the woman's body.

<p/>Though the Baines family had few friends -LRB-sustained hospitality being
little practised in those days-RRB- they had, of course, many
acquaintances, and, like other families, they counted their Christmas
cards as an Indian counts scalps. The tale was satisfactory. There were
between thirty and forty envelopes. Constance extracted Christmas cards
rapidly, reading their contents aloud, and then propping them up on the
mantelpiece. Mrs. Baines assisted. Fan dealt with the envelopes on the
floor. Mr. Povey, to prove that his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) soul was above toys and gewgaws,
continued to play the harmonium.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured in a startled, hesitant voice, holding
an envelope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, my chuck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's--''

 (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div><p/>The envelope was addressed to <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. and Miss Baines''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>in large,
perpendicular, dashing characters which Constance instantly recognised
as Sophia's. The stamps were strange, the postmark <div class="bookquote">``Paris.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Baines
leaned forward and looked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open it, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said.

<p/>The envelope contained an English Christmas card of a common type, a
spray of holly with greetings, and on it was written, <div class="bookquote">``I do hope this
will reach you on Christmas morning. Fondest love.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No signature, nor
address.

<p/>Mrs. Baines took it with a trembling hand, and adjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) spectacles.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) gazed at it a long time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it has done!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said, and wept.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) tried to speak again, but not being able to command herself, held
forth the card to Constance and jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head in the direction of Mr.
Povey. Constance rose and put the card on the keyboard of the harmonium.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>Mr. Povey stopped playing. <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) muttered.

<p/>Fan, perceiving that nobody was interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) feats, suddenly stood
still.

<p/>Mrs. Baines tried once more to speak, but could not. Then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) ringlets
shaking beneath the band of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) weeds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) feet, stepped to
the harmonium, and, with a movement almost convulsive, snatched the
card from Mr. Povey, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) chair.

<p/>Mr. Povey abruptly left the room, followed by Fan. Both the women were
in tears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was tremendously surprised to discover a dangerous
lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own throat. The beautiful and imperious vision of Sophia,
Sophia as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had left them, innocent, wayward, had swiftly risen up
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) and made even him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) a woman too! Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had never liked
Sophia. The awful secret wound in the family pride revealed itself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) as never before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) felt intensely the mother's tragedy, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast as Aunt Harriet had carried a cancer.

<p/>At dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said suddenly to Mrs. Baines, who still wept: <div class="bookquote">``Now,
mother, you must cheer up, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) said quickly. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did do.

<p/>Neither Samuel nor Constance saw the card again. Little was said. There
was nothing to say. As Sophia had given no address she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must be still
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) situation. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and sister.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ... she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not even know that Constance was married ... What sort
of a place was Paris? To Bursley, Paris was nothing but the site of a
great exhibition which had recently closed.

<p/>Through the influence of Mrs. Baines a new servant was found for
Constance in a village near Axe, a raw, comely girl who had never been
in a <div class="bookquote">``place.''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>And through the post it was arranged that this innocent
should come to the cave on the thirty-first of December. In obedience
to the safe rule that servants should never be allowed to meet for the
interchange of opinions, Mrs. Baines decided to leave with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own
servant on the thirtieth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would not be persuaded to spend the New
Year in the Square. On the twenty-ninth poor Aunt Maria died all of a
sudden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cottage in Brougham Street. Everybody was duly
distressed, and in particular Mrs. Baines's demeanour under this
affliction showed the perfection of correctness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) caused it to
be understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) should not remain for the funeral. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) nerves
would be unequal to the ordeal; and, moreover, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) servant must not
stay to corrupt the new girl, nor could Mrs. Baines think of sending
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) servant to Axe in advance, to spend several days in idle gossip
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) colleague.

<p/>This decision took the backbone out of Aunt Maria's funeral, which
touched the extreme of modesty: a hearse and a one-horse coach. Mr.
Povey was glad, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) happened to be very busy. An hour before his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
mother-in-law's departure he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) came into the parlour with the proof of a
poster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that, Samuel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Baines, not dreaming of the blow
that awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's for my first Annual Sale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Povey with false
tranquillity.

<p/>Mrs. Baines merely tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) head. Constance, happily for Constance,
was not present at this final defeat of the old order. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) been
there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would certainly not have known where to look.

<p/>II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty next birthday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey exclaimed one day, with an expression
and in a tone that were at once mock-serious and serious. This was on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) thirty-ninth birthday.

<p/>Constance was startled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had, of course, been aware that they were
getting older, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had never realized the phenomenon. Though
customers occasionally remarked that Mr. Povey was stouter, and though
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) to measure himself for a new suit of clothes the
tape proved the fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had not changed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) too
had become somewhat stouter; but for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) remained exactly the
same Constance. Only by recalling dates and by calculations could she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
really grasp that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been married a little over six years and not
a little over six months. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had to admit that, if Samuel would be
forty next birthday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would be twenty-seven next birthday. But it
would not be a real twenty-seven; nor would Sam's forty be a real
forty, like other people's twenty-sevens and forties. Not long since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been in the habit of regarding a man of forty as senile, as
practically in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grave.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) reflected, and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) reflected the more clearly she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) saw that
after all the almanacs had not lied. Look at Fan! Yes, it must be five
years since the memorable morning when doubt first crossed the minds of
Samuel and Constance as to Fan's moral principles. Samuel's enthusiasm
for dogs was equalled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) ignorance of the dangers to which a young
female of temperament may be exposed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was much disturbed as
doubt developed into certainty. Fan, indeed, was the one being who did
not suffer from shock and who had no fears as to the results. The
animal, having a pure mind, was bereft of modesty. Sundry enormities
had she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) committed, but none to rank with this one! The result was four
quadrupeds recognizable as fox-terriers. Mr. Povey breathed again. Fan
had had more luck than she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) deserved, for the result might have been
simply anything. Her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) owners forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) and disposed of these fruits of
iniquity, and then married her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) lawfully to a husband who was so high up
in the world that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could demand a dowry. And now Fan was a
grandmother, with fixed ideas and habits, and a son in the house, and
various grandchildren scattered over the town. Fan was a sedate and
disillusioned dog. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) knew the world as it was, and in learning it she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)
had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) owners above a bit.

<p/>Then there was Maggie Hollins. Constance could still vividly recall the
self-consciousness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had one day received Maggie and the
heir of the Hollinses; but it was a long time ago. After staggering
half the town by the production of this infant -LRB-of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nearly
died-RRB- Maggie allowed the angels to waft it away to heaven, and
everybody said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ought to be very thankful--at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) age. Old
women dug up out of their minds forgotten histories of the
eccentricities of the goddess Lucina. Mrs. Baines was most curiously
interested; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) talked freely to Constance, and Constance began to see
what an incredible town Bursley had always been--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) never
suspected it! Maggie was now mother of other children, and the
draggled, lame mistress of a drunken home, and looked sixty. Despite
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) prophecy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband had conserved his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``habits.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>The Poveys ate
all the fish they could, and sometimes more than they enjoyed, because
on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sober days Hollins invariably started his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) round at the shop, and
Constance had to buy for Maggie's sake. The worst of the worthless
husband was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) seldom failed to be cheery and polite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) never
missed asking after the health of Mrs. Baines. And when Constance
replied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother was `pretty well considering,'' but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
would not come over to Bursley again until the Axe railway was opened,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could not stand the drive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) grey head and be
sympathetically gloomy for an instant.

<p/>All these changes in six years! The almanacs were in the right of it.

<p/>But nothing had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). Gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had obtained a sure
ascendency over her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother, yet without seeking it, merely as the
outcome of time's influences on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother respectively.
Gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had gained skill and use in the management of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
household and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) share of the shop, so that these machines ran
smoothly and effectively and a sudden contretemps no longer frightened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). Gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had constructed a chart of Samuel's individuality,
with the submerged rocks and perilous currents all carefully marked, so
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could now voyage unalarmed in those seas. But nothing
happened. Unless their visits to Buxton could be called happenings!
Decidedly the visit to Buxton was the one little hill that rose out of
the level plain of the year. They had formed the annual habit of going
to Buxton for ten days. They had a way of saying: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we always go to
Buxton. We went there for our honeymoon, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Anne</b></font>)</div>They had become
confirmed Buxtonites, with views concerning St. Anne's Terrace, the
Broad Walk and Peel's Cavern. They could not dream of deserting their
Buxton. It was the sole possible resort. Was it not the highest town in
England? Well, then! They always stayed at the same lodgings, and grew
to be special favourites of the landlady, who whispered of them to all
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) other guests as having come to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) house for their honeymoon, and
as never missing a year, and as being most respectable, superior people
in quite a large way of business. Each year they walked out of Buxton
station behind their luggage on a truck, full of joy and pride because
they knew all the landmarks, and the lie of all the streets, and which
were the best shops.

<p/>At the beginning, the notion of leaving the shop to hired custody had
seemed almost fantastic, and the preparations for absence had been very
complicated. Then it was that Miss Insull had detached herself from the
other young lady assistants as a creature who could be absolutely
trusted. Miss Insull was older than Constance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had a bad
complexion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was not clever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was one of your reliable
ones. The six years had witnessed the slow, steady rise of Miss Insull.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) employers said ``Miss Insull' in a tone quite different from that in
which they said ``Miss Hawkins,'' or ``Miss Dadd.'' ``Miss Insull' meant the
end of a discussion. <div class="bookquote">``Better tell Miss Insull.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Insull will see
to that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall ask Miss Insull.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>Miss Insull slept in the house ten
nights every year. Miss Insull had been called into consultation when
it was decided to engage a fourth hand in the shape of an apprentice.

<p/>Trade had improved in the point of excellence. It was now admitted to
be good--a rare honour for trade! The coal-mining boom was at its
height, and colliers, in addition to getting drunk, were buying
American organs and expensive bull-terriers. Often they would come to
the shop to purchase cloth for coats for their dogs. And they would
have good cloth. Mr. Povey did not like this. One day a butty chose for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dog the best cloth of Mr. Povey's shop--at 12s. a yard. <div class="bookquote">``Will ye
make it up? I've gotten th' measurements,''  (<font color='red'><b>the collier</b></font>)</div>asked the collier. <div class="bookquote">``No, I
won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, hotly. <div class="bookquote">``And what's more, I won't sell you the
cloth either! Cloth at 12s. a yard on a dog's back indeed! I'll thank
you to get out of my shop!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The incident became historic, in the
Square. It finally established that Mr. Povey was a worthy son-in-law
and a solid and successful man. It vindicated the old pre-eminence of
<div class="bookquote">``Baines's.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Some surprise was expressed that Mr. Povey showed no desire
nor tendency towards entering the public life of the town. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) never
would, though a keen satirical critic of the Local Board in private.
And at the chapel he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) remained a simple private worshipper, refusing
stewardships and trusteeships.

<p/>III

<p/>Was Constance happy? Of course there was always something on her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mind,
something that had to be dealt with, either in the shop or in the
house, something to employ all the skill and experience which she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
acquired. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) life had much in it of laborious tedium--tedium
never-ending and monotonous. And both she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) and Samuel worked
consistently hard, rising early, `pushing forward,'' as the phrase ran,
and going to bed early from sheer fatigue; week after week and month
after month as season changed imperceptibly into season. In June and
July it would happen to them occasionally to retire before the last
silver of dusk was out of the sky. They would lie in bed and talk
placidly of their daily affairs. There would be a noise in the street
below. ``Vaults closing!'' Samuel would say, and yawn. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's quite
late,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Constance would say. And the Swiss clock would rapidly strike
eleven on its coil of resonant wire. And then, just before she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) went to
sleep, Constance might reflect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) destiny, as even the busiest
and smoothest women do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would decide that it was kind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
mother's gradual decline and lonely life at Axe saddened her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>). The cards
which came now and then at extremely long intervals from Sophia had
been the cause of more sorrow than joy. The naive ecstasies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
girlhood had long since departed--the price paid for experience and
self-possession and a true vision of things. The vast inherent
melancholy of the universe did not exempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went to sleep
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would be conscious of a vague contentment. The basis of this
contentment was the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Samuel comprehended and esteemed
each other, and made allowances for each other. Their characters had
been tested and had stood the test. Affection, love, was not to them a
salient phenomenon in their relations. Habit had inevitably dulled its
glitter. It was like a flavouring, scarce remarked; but had it been
absent, how they would have turned from that dish!

<p/>Samuel never, or hardly ever, set himself to meditate upon the problem
whether or not life had come up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) expectations. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had, at
times, strange sensations which he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) did not analyze, and which
approached nearer to ecstasy than any feeling of Constance's. Thus,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) dark furies, molten within and black without,
the sudden thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) wife's unalterable benignant calm, which
nothing could overthrow, might strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) into a wondering cold. For
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was astoundingly feminine. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would put flowers on the
mantelpiece, and then, hours afterwards, in the middle of a meal, ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) unexpectedly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) `garden;' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) gradually
divined that a perfunctory reply left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) unsatisfied; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted a
genuine opinion; a genuine opinion mattered to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Fancy calling
flowers on a mantelpiece a `garden'! How charming, how childlike! Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had a way, on Sunday mornings, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) descended to the parlour
all ready for chapel, of shutting the door at the foot of the stairs
with a little bang, shaking herself, and turning round swiftly as if
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) inspection, as if saying: <div class="bookquote">``Well, what about this? Will this
do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A phenomenon always associated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mind with the smell of kid
gloves! Invariably she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) about the colours and cut of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
dresses. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) prefer this, or that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) could not take such
questions seriously until one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) happened to hint, merely hint,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was not a thorough-going admirer of a certain new dress--it was
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first new dress after the definite abandonment of crinolines. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
never wore it again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not serious at first, and
remonstrated against a joke being carried too far. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``It's not
a bit of use you talking, I shan't wear it again.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) so far
appreciated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seriousness as to refrain, by discretion, from any
comment. The incident affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) for days. It flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>); it
thrilled him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>); but it baffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). Strange that a woman subject to such
caprices should be so sagacious, capable, and utterly reliable as
Constance was! For the practical and commonsense side of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eternally
compelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) admiration. The very first example of it--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) insistence
that the simultaneous absence of both of them from the shop for half an
hour or an hour twice a day would not mean the immediate downfall of
the business--had remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mind ever since. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not been
obstinate--in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) benevolent way--against the old superstition which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
had acquired from his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) employers, they might have been eating separately
to that day. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) handling of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother during the months of the
siege of Paris, when Mrs. Baines was convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sinful daughter
was in hourly danger of death, had been extraordinarily fine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
considered. And the sequel, a card for Constance's birthday, had
completely justified her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) attitude.

<p/>Sometimes some blundering fool would jovially exclaim to them:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about that baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>some blundering fool</b></font>)</div><p/>Or a woman would remark quietly: <div class="bookquote">``I often feel sorry you've no
children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>And they would answer that really they did not know what they would do
if there was a baby. What with the shop and one thing or another...!
And they were quite sincere.

<p/>IV

<p/>It is remarkable what a little thing will draw even the most regular
and serious people from the deep groove of their habits. One morning in
March, a boneshaker, an affair on two equal wooden wheels joined by a
bar of iron, in the middle of which was a wooden saddle, disturbed the
gravity of St. Luke's Square. True, it was probably the first
boneshaker that had ever attacked the gravity of St. Luke's Square. It
came out of the shop of Daniel Povey, the confectioner and baker, and
Samuel Povey's celebrated cousin, in Boulton Terrace. Boulton Terrace
formed nearly a right angle with the Baines premises, and at the corner
of the angle Wedgwood Street and King Street left the Square. The
boneshaker was brought forth by Dick Povey, the only son of Daniel, now
aged eleven years, under the superintendence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) father, and the
Square soon perceived that Dick had a natural talent for breaking-in an
untrained boneshaker. After a few attempts he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could remain on the back
of the machine for at least ten yards, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) feats had the effect of
endowing St. Luke's Square with the attractiveness of a circus. Samuel
Povey watched with candid interest from the ambush of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) door, while
the unfortunate young lady assistants, though aware of the performance
that was going on, dared not stir from the stove. Samuel was
tremendously tempted to sally out boldly, and chat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cousin
about the toy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had surely a better right to do so than any other
tradesman in the Square, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was of the family; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) diffidence
prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) from moving. Presently Daniel Povey and Dick went to the
top of the Square with the machine, opposite Holl's, and Dick, being
carefully installed in the saddle, essayed to descend the gentle paven
slopes of the Square. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) failed time after time; the machine had an
astonishing way of turning round, running uphill, and then lying calmly
on its side. At this point of Dick's life-history every shop-door in
the Square was occupied by an audience. At last the boneshaker
displayed less unwillingness to obey, and lo! in a moment Dick was
riding down the Square, and the spectators held their breath as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
had been Blondin crossing Niagara. Every second he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) ought to have fallen
off, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) contrived to keep upright. Already he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had accomplished
twenty yards--thirty yards! It was a miracle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was performing!
The transit continued, and seemed to occupy hours. And then a faint
hope rose in the breast of the watchers that the prodigy might arrive
at the bottom of the Square. His (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) speed was increasing with his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``nack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the Square was enormous, boundless. Samuel Povey gazed at the
approaching phenomenon, as a bird at a serpent, with bulging, beady
eyes. The child's speed went on increasing and his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) path grew
straighter. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would arrive; he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would do it! Samuel Povey
involuntarily lifted one leg in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) nervous tension. And now the hope
that Dick would arrive became a fear, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) pace grew still more
rapid. Everybody lifted one leg, and gaped. And the intrepid child
surged on, and, finally victorious, crashed into the pavement in front
of Samuel at the rate of quite six miles an hour.

<p/>Samuel picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) up, unscathed. And somehow this picking up of Dick
invested Samuel with importance, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) a share in the glory of the
feat itself.

<p/>Daniel Povey same running and joyous. <div class="bookquote">``Not so bad for a start, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the great Daniel. Though by no means a simple man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pride
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offspring sometimes made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little naive.

<p/>Father and son explained the machine to Samuel, Dick incessantly
repeating the exceedingly strange truth that if you felt you were
falling to your right you must turn to your right and vice versa.
Samuel found himself suddenly admitted, as it were, to the inner
fellowship of the boneshaker, exalted above the rest of the Square. In
another adventure more thrilling events occurred. The fair-haired Dick
was one of those dangerous, frenzied madcaps who are born without fear.
The secret of the machine had been revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) recent
transit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was silently determining to surpass himself.
Precariously balanced, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) descended the Square again, frowning hard,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) teeth set, and actually managed to swerve into King Street.
Constance, in the parlour, saw an incomprehensible winged thing fly
past the window. The cousins Povey sounded an alarm and protest and ran
in pursuit; for the gradient of King Street is, in the strict sense,
steep. Half-way down King Street Dick was travelling at twenty miles an
hour, and heading straight for the church, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) meant to
disestablish it and perish. The main gate of the churchyard was open,
and that affrighting child, with a lunatic's luck, whizzed safely
through the portals into God's acre. The cousins Povey discovered him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
lying on a green grave, clothed in pride. His (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) first words were: <div class="bookquote">``Dad,
did you pick my cap up?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The symbolism of the amazing ride did not
escape the Square; indeed, it was much discussed.

<p/>This incident led to a friendship between the cousins. They formed a
habit of meeting in the Square for a chat. The meetings were the
subject of comment, for Samuel's relations with the greater Daniel had
always been of the most distant. It was understood that Samuel
disapproved of Mrs. Daniel Povey even, more than the majority of people
disapproved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). Mrs. Daniel Povey, however, was away from home;
probably, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) not been, Samuel would not even have gone to the
length of joining Daniel on the neutral ground of the open Square. But
having once broken the ice, Samuel was glad to be on terms of growing
intimacy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cousin. The friendship flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), for Daniel,
despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife, was a figure in a world larger than Samuel's;
moreover, it consecrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) position as the equal of no matter what
tradesman -LRB-apprentice though he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had been-RRB-, and also he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) genuinely liked
and admired Daniel, rather to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) own astonishment.

<p/>Every one liked Daniel Povey; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was a favourite among all ranks. The
leading confectioner, a member of the Local Board, and a sidesman at
St. Luke's, he (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) was, and had been for twenty-five years, very prominent
in the town. He (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) was a tall, handsome man, with a trimmed, greying
beard, a jolly smile, and a flashing, dark eye. His (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) good humour seemed
to be permanent. He (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) had dignity without the slightest stiffness; he (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) was
welcomed by his (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) equals and frankly adored by his (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) inferiors. He (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) ought to
have been Chief Bailiff, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>) was rich enough; but there intervened a
mysterious obstacle between Daniel Povey and the supreme honour, a
scarcely tangible impediment which could not be definitely stated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bailiff</b></font>)
was capable, honest, industrious, successful, and an excellent speaker;
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) did not belong to the austerer section of society, if, for
example, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) thought nothing of dropping into the Tiger for a glass of
beer, or of using an oath occasionally, or of telling a facetious
story--well, in a busy, broad-minded town of thirty thousand
inhabitants, such proclivities are no bar whatever to perfect esteem.
But--how is one to phrase it without wronging Daniel Povey? He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was
entirely moral; his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) views were unexceptionable. The truth is that, for
the ruling classes of Bursley, Daniel Povey was just a little too
fanatical a worshipper of the god Pan. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was one of the remnant who
had kept alive the great Pan tradition from the days of the Regency
through the vast, arid Victorian expanse of years. The flighty
character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife was regarded by many as a judgment upon him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) for
the robust Rabelaisianism of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) more private conversation, for his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
frank interest in, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eternal preoccupation with, aspects of life and
human activity which, though essential to the divine purpose, are not
openly recognized as such--even by Daniel Poveys. It was not a question
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) conduct; it was a question of the cast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) mind. If it did
not explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) friendship with the rector of St. Luke's, it explained
his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) departure from the Primitive Methodist connexion, to which the
Poveys as a family had belonged since Primitive Methodism was created
in Turnhill in 1807.

<p/>Daniel Povey had a way of assuming that every male was boiling over
with interest in the sacred cult of Pan. The assumption, though
sometimes causing inconvenience at first, usually conquered by virtue
of its inherent truthfulness. Thus it fell out with Samuel. Samuel had
not suspected that Pan had silken cords to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had always
averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) eyes from the god--that is to say, within reason. Yet now
Daniel, on perhaps a couple of fine mornings a week, in full Square,
with Fan sitting behind on the cold stones, and Mr. Critchlow ironic at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) door in a long white apron, would entertain Samuel Povey for half
an hour with Pan's most intimate lore, and Samuel Povey would not
blench. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would, on the contrary, stand up to Daniel like a little
man, and pretend with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) might to be, potentially, a perfect
arch-priest of the god. Daniel taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) a lot; turned over the page
of life for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), as it were, and, showing the reverse side, seemed to
say: <div class="bookquote">``You were missing all that.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Samuel gazed upwards at the handsome
long nose and rich lips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) elder cousin, so experienced, so
agreeable, so renowned, so esteemed, so philosophic, and admitted to
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had lived to the age of forty in a state of comparative
boobyism. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) would gaze downwards at the faint patch of flour
on Daniel's right leg, and conceive that life was, and must be, life.

<p/>Not many weeks after his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) initiation into the cult he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was startled by
Constance's preoccupied face one evening. Now, a husband of six years'
standing, to whom it has not happened to become a father, is not easily
startled by such a face as Constance wore. Years ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had frequently
been startled, had frequently lived in suspense for a few days. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
had long since grown impervious to these alarms. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
startled again--but as a man may be startled who is not altogether
surprised at being startled. And seven endless days passed, and Samuel
and Constance glanced at each other like guilty things, whose secret
refuses to be kept. Then three more days passed, and another three.
Then Samuel Povey remarked in a firm, masculine, fact-fronting tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there's no doubt about it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>And they glanced at each other like conspirators who have lighted a
fuse and cannot take refuge in flight. Their eyes said continually,
with a delicious, an enchanting mixture of ingenuous modesty and
fearful joy:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we've gone and done it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There it was, the incredible, incomprehensible future--coming!

<p/>Samuel had never correctly imagined the manner of its heralding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had
imagined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) early simplicity that one day Constance, blushing,
might put her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) mouth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ear and whisper--something positive. It had
not occurred in the least like that. But things are so obstinately, so
incurably unsentimental.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we ought to drive over and tell mother, on Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said
Constance.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) impulse was to reply, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) grand, offhand style: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, a letter
will do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) checked himself and said, with careful deference: <div class="bookquote">``You think
that will be better than writing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All was changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) braced every fibre to meet destiny, and to help
Constance to meet it.

<p/>The weather threatened on Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) went to Axe without Constance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
cousin drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) there in a dog-cart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) should
walk home, as the exercise would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) good. During the drive Daniel,
in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had not confided, chattered as usual, and Samuel pretended
to listen with the same attitude as usual; but secretly he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) despised
Daniel for a man who has got something not of the first importance on
the brain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) perspective was truer than Daniel's.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) walked home, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had decided, over the wavy moorland of the county
dreaming in the heart of England. Night fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) in mid-career, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was tired. But the earth, as it whirled through naked space, whirled
up the moon for him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) pressed on at a good speed. A wind from
Arabia wandering cooled his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) face. And at last, over the brow of Toft
End, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) saw suddenly the Five Towns a-twinkle on their little hills
down in the vast amphitheatre. And one of those lamps was Constance's
lamp--one, somewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) lived, then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) entered into the shadow of
nature. The mysteries made him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) solemn. What! A boneshaker, his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) cousin,
and then this!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm damned! Well, I'm damned!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) kept repeating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) who never
swore.




<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>CYRIL

<p/>I


<p/>Constance stood at the large, many-paned window in the parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
stouter. Although always plump, her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) figure had been comely, with a
neat, well-marked waist. But now the shapeliness had gone; the
waist-line no longer existed, and there were no more crinolines to
create it artificially. An observer not under the charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) face
might have been excused for calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) fat and lumpy. The face, grave,
kind, and expectant, with its radiant, fresh cheeks, and the rounded
softness of its curves, atoned for the figure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was nearly
twenty-nine years of age.

<p/>It was late in October. In Wedgwood Street, next to Boulton Terrace,
all the little brown houses had been pulled down to make room for a
palatial covered market, whose foundations were then being dug. This
destruction exposed a vast area of sky to the north-east. A great dark
cloud with an untidy edge rose massively out of the depths and
curtained off the tender blue of approaching dusk; while in the west,
behind Constance, the sun was setting in calm and gorgeous melancholy
on the Thursday hush of the town. It was one of those afternoons which
gather up all the sadness of the moving earth and transform it into
beauty.

<p/>Samuel Povey turned the corner from Wedgwood Street, and crossed King
Street obliquely to the front-door, which Constance opened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) seemed
tired and anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>demanded Constance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s no better. There's no getting away from it, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s worse. I
should have stayed, only I knew you'd be worrying. So I caught the
three-fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is that Mrs. Gilchrist shaping as a nurse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gilchrist</b></font>)'s very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, with conviction. <div class="bookquote">``Very good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a blessing! I suppose you didn't happen to see the doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Samuel gave a deprecating gesture. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't say anything particular.
With dropsy, at that stage, you know ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance had returned to the window, her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) expectancy apparently
unappeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like the look of that cloud,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Are they out still?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Samuel inquired, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) overcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Constance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) features suddenly transfigured,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) sprang to the door, pulled it open, and descended the steps.

<p/>A perambulator was being rapidly pushed up the slope by a breathless
girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance gently protested, <div class="bookquote">``I told you not to venture far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hurried all I could, mum, soon as I seed that cloud,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl
puffed, with the air of one who is seriously thankful to have escaped a
great disaster.

<p/>Constance dived into the recesses of the perambulator and extricated
from its cocoon the centre of the universe, and scrutinized him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) with
quiet passion, and then rushed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) into the house, though not a
drop of rain had yet fallen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Amy, in ecstasy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) young virginal eyes
following him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) disappeared. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wheeled away the
perambulator, which now had no more value nor interest than an
egg-shell. It was necessary to take it right round to the Brougham
Street yard entrance, past the front of the closed shop.

<p/>Constance sat down on the horsehair sofa and hugged and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
prize before removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Daddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), as if imparting strange and rapturous
tidings. <div class="bookquote">``Here's Daddy come back from hanging up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coat in the
passage! Daddy rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then, with a swift transition of
voice and features: <div class="bookquote">``Do look at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), Sam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Samuel, preoccupied, stooped forward. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you little scoundrel! Oh,
you little scoundrel!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) greeted the baby, advancing his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) finger
towards the baby's nose.

<p/>The baby, who had hitherto maintained a passive indifference to
external phenomena, lifted elbows and toes, blew bubbles from his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) tiny
mouth, and stared at the finger with the most ravishing, roguish smile,
as though saying: <div class="bookquote">``I know that great sticking-out limb, and there is a
joke about it which no one but me can see, and which is my secret joy
that you shall never share.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Samuel asked, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) gravity and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) ordinary pose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must give the girl time to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) things off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll have the table drawn, away from the fire, and baby can lie on
his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) shawl on the hearthrug while we're having tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div>Then to the baby,
in rapture: <div class="bookquote">``And play with his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) toys; all his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) nice, nice toys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Miss Insull is staying for tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) head bent over the baby, who formed a white patch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
comfortable brown frock, nodded without speaking.

<p/>Samuel Povey, walking to and fro, began to enter into details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
hasty journey to Axe. Old Mrs. Baines, having beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) grandson, was
preparing to quit this world. Never again would she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) exclaim, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
brusque tone of genial ruthlessness: <div class="bookquote">``Fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The situation was
very difficult and distressing, for Constance could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) baby,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) would not, until the last urgency, run the risks of a journey
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to Axe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was being weaned. In any case Constance could not
have undertaken the nursing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother. A nurse had to be found. Mr.
Povey had discovered one in the person of Mrs. Gilchrist, the second
wife of a farmer at Malpas in Cheshire, whose first wife had been a
sister of the late John Baines. All the credit of Mrs. Gilchrist was
due to Samuel Povey. Mrs. Baines fretted seriously about Sophia, who
had given no sign of life for a very long time. Mr. Povey went to
Manchester and ascertained definitely from the relatives of Scales that
nothing was known of the pair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did not go to Manchester especially
on this errand. About once in three weeks, on Tuesdays, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had to visit
the Manchester warehouses; but the tracking of Scales's relative cost
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) so much trouble and time that, curiously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) came to believe that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had gone to Manchester one Tuesday for no other end. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was
very busy indeed in the shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) flew over to Axe and back whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
possibly could, to the neglect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was glad to do all
that was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) power; even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had not done it graciously his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
sensitive, tyrannic conscience would have forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) to do it. But
nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) felt rather virtuous, and worry and fatigue and loss of
sleep intensified this sense of virtue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that if there is any sudden change they will telegraph,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
finished, to Constance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) head. The words, clinching what had led up to them, drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) dream and she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) saw, for a moment, her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) mother in an agony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't surely mean--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) began, trying to disperse the
painful vision as unjustified by the facts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, with head singing, and hot eyes, and a
consciousness of high tension in every nerve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) body, <div class="bookquote">``I simply
mean that if there's any sudden change they will telegraph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>While they had tea, Samuel sitting opposite to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife, and Miss
Insull nearly against the wall -LRB-owing to the moving of the table-RRB-, the
baby rolled about on the hearthrug, which had been covered with a large
soft woollen shawl, originally the property of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) great-grandmother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had no cares, no responsibilities. The shawl was so vast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
could not clearly distinguish objects beyond its confines. On it lay an
indiarubber ball, an indiarubber doll, a rattle, and fan. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) vaguely
recollected all four items, with their respective properties. The fire
also was an old friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had occasionally tried to touch it, but a
high bright fence always came in between. For ten months he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never
spent a day without making experiments on this shifting universe in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) alone remained firm and stationary. The experiments were
chiefly conducted out of idle amusement, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was serious on the
subject of food. Lately the behaviour of the universe in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
food had somewhat perplexed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), had indeed annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). However, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
was of a forgetful, happy disposition, and so long as the universe
continued to fulfil its sole end as a machinery for the satisfaction,
somehow, of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) imperious desires, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not inclined to remonstrate.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gazed at the flames and laughed, and laughed because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had laughed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pushed the ball away and wriggled after it, and captured it with the
assurance of practice. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tried to swallow the doll, and it was not
until he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had tried several times to swallow it that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembered the
failure of previous efforts and philosophically desisted. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) rolled
with a fearful shock, arms and legs in air, against the mountainous
flank of that mammoth Fan, and clutched at Fan's ear. The whole mass of
Fan upheaved and vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) view, and was instantly forgotten by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) seized the doll and tried to swallow it, and repeated the
exhibition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) skill with the ball. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) saw the fire again and
laughed. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) existed for centuries: no responsibilities, no
appetites; and the shawl was vast. Terrific operations went on over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)
head. Giants moved to and fro. Great vessels were carried off and great
books were brought and deep voices rumbled regularly in the spaces
beyond the shawl. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) remained oblivious. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) became aware
that a face was looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) recognized it, and immediately
an uncomfortable sensation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) stomach disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) tolerated
it for fifty years or so, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) gave a little cry. Life had
resumed its seriousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Black alpaca. B quality. Width 20, t.a. 22 yards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>Miss Insull read
out of a great book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) and Mr. Povey were checking stock.

<p/>And Mr. Povey responded, <div class="bookquote">``Black alpaca B quality. Width 20, t.a. 22
yards. It wants ten minutes yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had glanced at the clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, well knowing that it wanted ten minutes.

<p/>The baby did not guess that a high invisible god named Samuel Povey,
whom nothing escaped, and who could do everything at once, was
controlling his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) universe from an inconceivable distance. On the
contrary, the baby was crying to himself, There is no God.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) weaning had reached the stage at which a baby really does not know
what will happen next. The annoyance had begun exactly three months
after his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) first tooth, such being the rule of the gods, and it had
grown more and more disconcerting. No sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) accustom himself to
a new phenomenon than it mysteriously ceased, and an old one took its
place which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had utterly forgotten. This afternoon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother nursed
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but not until she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had foolishly attempted to divert him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from the
seriousness of life by means of gewgaws of which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sick. Still;
once at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rich breast, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forgave and forgot all. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
simple natural breast to more modern inventions. And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no shame,
no modesty. Nor had his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother. It was an indecent carouse at which his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
father and Miss Insull had to assist. But his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father had shame. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
father would have preferred that, as Miss Insull had kindly offered to
stop and work on Thursday afternoon, and as the shop was chilly, the
due rotation should have brought the bottle round at half-past five
o'clock, and not the mother's breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a self-conscious parent,
rather apologetic to the world, rather apt to stand off and pretend
that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had nothing to do with the affair; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) genuinely disliked
that anybody should witness the intimate scene of HIS (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife feeding HIS (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
baby. Especially Miss Insull, that prim, dark, moustached spinster! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
would not have called it an outrage on Miss Insull, to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) to
witness the scene, but his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) idea approached within sight of the word.

<p/>Constance blandly offered herself to the child, with the unconscious
primitive savagery of a young mother, and as the baby fed, thoughts of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own mother flitted to and fro ceaselessly like vague shapes over
the deep sea of content which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind. This illness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
mother's was abnormal, and the baby was now, for the first time
perhaps, entirely normal in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) consciousness. The baby was something
which could be disturbed, not something which did disturb. What a
change! What a change that had seemed impossible until its full
accomplishment!

<p/>For months before the birth, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had glimpsed at nights and in other
silent hours the tremendous upset. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not allowed herself to be
silly in advance; by temperament she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was too sagacious, too well
balanced for that; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had had fitful instants of terror, when
solid ground seemed to sink away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and imagination shook at
what faced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Instants only! Usually she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could play the comedy of
sensible calmness to almost perfection. Then the appointed time drew
nigh. And still she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled, and Samuel smiled. But the preparations,
meticulous, intricate, revolutionary, belied their smiles. The intense
resolve to keep Mrs. Baines, by methods scrupulous or unscrupulous,
away from Bursley until all was over, belied their smiles. And then the
first pains, sharp, shocking, cruel, heralds of torture! But when they
had withdrawn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) smiled, again, palely. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was in bed, full of
the sensation that the whole house was inverted and disorganized,
hopelessly. And the doctor came into the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) smiled at the doctor
apologetically, foolishly, as if saying: <div class="bookquote">``We all come to it. Here I
am.''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was calm without. Oh, but what a prey of abject fear within!
<div class="bookquote">``I am at the edge of the precipice,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) thought ran; <div class="bookquote">``in a moment I
shall be over.''  (<font color='red'><b>the heralds army</b></font>)</div>And then the pains--not the heralds but the shattering
army, endless, increasing in terror as they thundered across her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). Yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could think, quite clearly: <div class="bookquote">``Now I'm in the middle of it. This is
it, the horror that I have not dared to look at. My life's in the
balance. I may never get up again. All has at last come to pass. It
seemed as if it would never come, as if this thing could not happen to
me. But at last it has come to pass!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah! Some one put the twisted end of a towel into her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hand again--she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
had loosed it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pulled, pulled, enough to break cables. And then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) shrieked. It was for pity. It was for some one to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), at any
rate to take notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was dying. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) soul was leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>).
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was alone, panic-stricken, in the midst of a cataclysm a
thousand times surpassing all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had imagined of sickening
horror. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot endure this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) thought passionately. <div class="bookquote">``It is
impossible that I should be asked to endure this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) wept;
beaten, terrorized, smashed and riven. No commonsense now! No wise
calmness now! No self-respect now! Why, not even a woman now! Nothing
but a kind of animalized victim! And then the supreme endless spasm,
during which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave up the ghost and bade good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very self.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was lying quite comfortable in the soft bed; idle, silly: happiness
forming like a thin crust over the lava of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anguish and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fright.
And by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side was the soul that had fought its way out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
ruthlessly; the secret disturber revealed to the light of morning.
Curious to look at! Not like any baby that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever seen; red,
creased, brutish! But--for some reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not examine--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
folded it in an immense tenderness.

<p/>Sam was by the bed, away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so comfortable and
silly that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not move her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head nor even ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to come round
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had to wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) came.

<p/>In the afternoon the doctor returned, and astounded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by saying that
hers had been an ideal confinement. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was too weary to rebuke him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) for
a senseless, blind, callous old man. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew. <div class="bookquote">``No
one will ever guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``no one ever can guess, what I've
been through! Talk as you like. I KNOW, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had resumed cognizance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) household, perceiving that
it was demoralized from top to bottom, and that when the time came to
begin upon it she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not be able to settle where to begin, even
supposing that the baby were not there to monopolize her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attention. The
task appalled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted to get up. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got up. What a
blow to self-confidence! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went back to bed like a little scared
rabbit to its hole, glad, glad to be on the soft pillows again. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said: <div class="bookquote">``Yet the time must come when I shall be downstairs, and walking
about and meeting people, and cooking and superintending the
millinery.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Well, it did come--except that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had to renounce the
millinery to Miss Insull--but it was not the same. No, different! The
baby pushed everything else on to another plane. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a terrific
intruder; not one minute of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old daily life was left; he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made no
compromise whatever. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gaze from him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might pop
off into eternity and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>And now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was calmly and sensibly giving him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suck in presence of Miss
Insull. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was used to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) importance, to the fragility of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
organism, to waking twice every night, to being fat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was strong
again. The convulsive twitching that for six months had worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>)
repose, had quite disappeared. The state of being a mother was normal,
and the baby was so normal that she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) could not conceive the house
without him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>All in ten months!

<p/>When the baby was installed in his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cot for the night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) came
downstairs and found Miss Insull and Samuel still working, and Larder
than ever, but at addition sums now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) sat down, leaving the door
open at the foot of the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had embroidery in hand: a cap. And
while Miss Insull and Samuel combined pounds, shillings, and pence,
whispering at great speed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) bent over the delicate, intimate,
wasteful handiwork, drawing the needle with slow exactitude. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>)
would raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) head and listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>said Miss Insull, <div class="bookquote">``I think I hear baby crying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And two are eight and three are eleven. He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) must cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey,
rapidly, without looking up.

<p/>The baby's parents did not make a practice of discussing their domestic
existence even with Miss Insull; but Constance had to justify herself
as a mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've made perfectly sure he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s comfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s only
crying because he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) fancies he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s neglected. And we think he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) can't begin
too early to learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How right you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>said Miss Insull. <div class="bookquote">``Two and carry three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That distant, feeble, querulous, pitiful cry continued obstinately. It
continued for thirty minutes. Constance could not proceed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>)
work. The cry disintegrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) will, dissolved her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) hard sagacity.

<p/>Without a word she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) crept upstairs, having carefully deposed the cap on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) rocking-chair.

<p/>Mr. Povey hesitated a moment and then bounded up after her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>), startling
Fan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) shut the door on Miss Insull, but Fan was too quick for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)
saw Constance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) hand on the bedroom door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) protested, holding himself in. <div class="bookquote">``Now what ARE you
going to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do be reasonable and come downstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) spoke in a low voice, scarcely masking his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) nervous irritation, and
tiptoed along the corridor towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) and up the two steps past the
gas-burner. Fan followed, wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) tail expectant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s not well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey exclaimed contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``You remember what
happened last night and what you said!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They argued, subduing their tones to the false semblance of good-will,
there in the closeness of the corridor. Fan, deceived, ceased to wag
her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) tail and then trotted away. The baby's cry, behind the door, rose
to a mysterious despairing howl, which had such an effect on
Constance's heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) could have walked through fire to reach the
baby. But Mr. Povey's will held her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) rebelled, angry, hurt,
resentful. Commonsense, the ideal of mutual forbearance, had winged
away from that excited pair. It would have assuredly ended in a
quarrel, with Samuel glaring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) in black fury from the other side
of a bottomless chasm, had not Miss Insull most surprisingly burst up
the stairs.

<p/>Mr. Povey turned to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>), swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A telegram!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>said Miss Insull. <div class="bookquote">``The postmaster brought it down
himself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Mr. Derry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Samuel, opening the telegram with an
affectation of majesty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said it was too late for delivery by rights. But as it seemed
very important ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Samuel scanned it and nodded gravely; then gave it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife. Tears
came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get Cousin Daniel to drive me over at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, master
of himself and of the situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it be better to hire?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance suggested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had a
prejudice against Daniel.

<p/>Mr. Povey shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) offered,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I can't refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>)
offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put your thick overcoat on, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, in a dream,
descending with him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it isn't--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>Miss Insull stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes it is, Miss Insull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, deliberately.

<p/>In less than a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>Constance ran upstairs. But the cry had ceased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) turned the
door-knob softly, slowly, and crept into the chamber. A night-light
made large shadows among the heavy mahogany and the crimson, tasselled
rep in the close-curtained room. And between the bed and the ottoman
-LRB-on which lay Samuel's newly-bought family Bible-RRB- the cot loomed in the
shadows. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) picked up the night-light and stole round the bed. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
had decided to fall asleep. The hazard of death afar off had just
defeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) devilish obstinacy. Fate had bested him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>). How marvellously
soft and delicate that tear-stained cheek! How frail that tiny, tiny
clenched hand! In Constance grief and joy were mystically united.

<p/>II

<p/>The drawing-room was full of visitors, in frocks of ceremony. The old
drawing-room, but newly and massively arranged with the finest
Victorian furniture from dead Aunt Harriet's house at Axe; two
<div class="bookquote">``Canterburys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Aunt Harriet</b></font>)</div>a large bookcase, a splendid scintillant table solid
beyond lifting, intricately tortured chairs and armchairs! The original
furniture of the drawing-room was now down in the parlour, making it
grand. All the house breathed opulence; it was gorged with quiet,
restrained expensiveness; the least considerable objects, in the most
modest corners, were what Mrs. Baines would have termed <div class="bookquote">``good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>Constance and Samuel had half of all Aunt Harriet's money and half of
Mrs. Baines's; the other half was accumulating for a hypothetical
Sophia, Mr. Critchlow being the trustee. The business continued to
flourish. People knew that Samuel Povey was buying houses. Yet Samuel
and Constance had not made friends; they had not, in the Five Towns
phrase, `branched out socially,'' though they had very meetly branched
out on subscription lists. They kept themselves to themselves
-LRB-emphasizing the preposition-RRB-. These guests were not their guests; they
were the guests of Cyril.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had been named Samuel because Constance would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) named after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) father, and Cyril because his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) father secretly despised the name of
Samuel; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was called Cyril; <div class="bookquote">``Master Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>by Amy, definite
successor to Maggie. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) mother's thoughts were on Cyril as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was awake. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father, when not planning Cyril's welfare, was earning
money whose unique object could be nothing but Cyril's welfare. Cyril
was the pivot of the house; every desire ended somewhere in Cyril. The
shop existed now solely for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). And those houses that Samuel bought by
private treaty, or with a shamefaced air at auctions--somehow they were
aimed at Cyril. Samuel and Constance had ceased to be self-justifying
beings; they never thought of themselves save as the parents of Cyril.

<p/>They realized this by no means fully. Had they been accused of
monomania they would have smiled the smile of people confident in their
commonsense and their mental balance. Nevertheless, they were
monomaniacs. Instinctively they concealed the fact as much as possible;
They never admitted it even to themselves. Samuel, indeed, would often
say: <div class="bookquote">``That child is not everybody. That child must be kept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
place.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance was always teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) father
as the most important person in the household. Samuel was always
teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) mother as the most important person
in the household. Nothing was left undone to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was a
cipher, a nonentity, who ought to be very glad to be alive. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) knew
all about his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) importance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) knew that the entire town was his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) knew
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) parents were deceiving themselves. Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was punished
he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) well knew that it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was so important. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) never imparted
any portion of this knowledge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) parents; a primeval wisdom
prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) to retain it strictly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) own bosom.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was four and a half years old, dark, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) father; handsome like
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) aunt, and tall for his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) age; not one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) features resembled a
feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) mother's, but sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) `had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) look.'' From the
capricious production of inarticulate sounds, and then a few
monosyllables that described concrete things and obvious desires, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
had gradually acquired an astonishing idiomatic command over the most
difficult of Teutonic languages; there was nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) could not
say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) could walk and run, was full of exact knowledge about God, and
entertained no doubt concerning the special partiality of a minor deity
called Jesus towards himself.

<p/>Now, this party was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) mother's invention and scheme. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) father,
after flouting it, had said that if it was to be done at all, it should
be done well, and had brought to the doing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) organizing skill.
Cyril had accepted it at first--merely accepted it; but, as the day
approached and the preparations increased in magnitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had come to
look on it with favour, then with enthusiasm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father having taken
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to Daniel Povey's opposite, to choose cakes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had shown, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
solemn and fastidious waverings, how seriously he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) regarded the affair.

<p/>Of course it had to occur on a Thursday afternoon. The season was
summer, suitable for pale and fragile toilettes. And the eight children
who sat round Aunt Harriet's great table glittered like the sun. Not
Constance's specially provided napkins could hide that wealth and
profusion of white lace and stitchery. Never in after-life are the
genteel children of the Five Towns so richly clad as at the age of four
or five years. Weeks of labour, thousands of cubic feet of gas, whole
nights stolen from repose, eyesight, and general health, will disappear
into the manufacture of a single frock that accidental jam may ruin in
ten seconds. Thus it was in those old days; and thus it is to-day.
Cyril's guests ranged in years from four to six; they were chiefly
older than their host; this was a pity, it impaired his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) importance; but
up to four years a child's sense of propriety, even of common decency,
is altogether too unreliable for a respectable party.

<p/>Round about the outskirts of the table were the elders, ladies the
majority; they also in their best, for they had to meet each other.
Constance displayed a new dress, of crimson silk; after having mourned
for her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) mother she (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) had definitely abandoned the black which, by reason
of her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) duties in the shop, she (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) had constantly worn from the age of
sixteen to within a few months of Cyril's birth; she (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) never went into
the shop now, except casually, on brief visits of inspection. She (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) was
still fat; the destroyer of her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) figure sat at the head of the table.
Samuel kept close to her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was the only male, until Mr. Critchlow
astonishingly arrived; among the company Mr. Critchlow had a
grand-niece. Samuel, if not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) best, was certainly not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
everyday suit. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) large frilled shirt-front, and small black tie,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) little black beard and dark face over that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) looked very
nervous and self-conscious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had not the habit of entertaining. Nor
had Constance; but her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) benevolence ever bubbling up to the calm surface
of her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) personality made self-consciousness impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>). Miss
Insull was also present, in shop-black, `to help.'' Lastly there was
Amy, now as the years passed slowly assuming the character of a
faithful retainer, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was only twenty-three. An ugly, abrupt,
downright girl, with convenient notions of pleasure! For she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would rise
early and retire late in order to contrive an hour to go out with
Master Cyril; and to be allowed to put Master Cyril to bed was, really,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) highest bliss.

<p/>All these elders were continually inserting arms into the fringe of
fluffy children that surrounded the heaped table; removing dangerous
spoons out of cups into saucers, replacing plates, passing cakes,
spreading jam, whispering consolations, explanations, and sage counsel.
Mr. Critchlow, snow-white now but unbent, remarked that there was 'a
pretty cackle,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) sniffed. Although the window was slightly open,
the air was heavy with the natural human odour which young children
transpire. More than one mother, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nose into a lacy mass, to
whisper, inhaled that pleasant perfume with a voluptuous thrill.

<p/>Cyril, while attending steadily to the demands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) body, was in a
mood which approached the ideal. Proud and radiant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) combined
urbanity with a certain fine condescension. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) bright eyes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
manner of scraping up jam with a spoon, said: <div class="bookquote">``I am the king of this
party. This party is solely in my honour. I know that. We all know it.
Still, I will pretend that we are equals, you and I.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) talked about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) picture-books to a young woman on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) right named Jennie, aged
four, pale, pretty, the belle in fact, and Mr. Critchlow's grand-niece.
The boy's attractiveness was indisputable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) could put on quite an
aristocratic air. It was the most delicious sight to see them, Cyril
and Jennie, so soft and delicate, so infantile on their piles of
cushions and books, with their white socks and black shoes dangling far
distant from the carpet; and yet so old, so self-contained! And they
were merely an epitome of the whole table. The whole table was bathed
in the charm and mystery of young years, of helpless fragility, gentle
forms, timid elegance, unshamed instincts, and waking souls. Constance
and Samuel were very satisfied; full of praise for other people's
children, but with the reserve that of course Cyril was hors concours.
They both really did believe, at that moment, that Cyril was, in some
subtle way which they felt but could not define, superior to all other
infants.

<p/>Some one, some officious relative of a visitor, began to pass a certain
cake which had brown walls, a roof of cocoa-nut icing, and a yellow
body studded with crimson globules. Not a conspicuously gorgeous cake,
not a cake to which a catholic child would be likely to attach
particular importance; a good, average cake! Who could have guessed
that it stood, in Cyril's esteem, as the cake of cakes? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had insisted
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father buying it at Cousin Daniel's, and perhaps Samuel ought to
have divined that for Cyril that cake was the gleam that an ardent
spirit would follow through the wilderness. Samuel, however, was not a
careful observer, and seriously lacked imagination. Constance knew only
that Cyril had mentioned the cake once or twice. Now by the hazard of
destiny that cake found much favour, helped into popularity as it was
by the blundering officious relative who, not dreaming what volcano she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
was treading on, urged its merits with simpering enthusiasm. One boy
took two slices, a slice in each hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) happened to be the visitor of
whom the cake-distributor was a relative, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) protested; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
expressed the shock she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) suffered. Whereupon both Constance and Samuel
sprang forward and swore with angelic smiles that nothing could be more
perfect than the propriety of that dear little fellow taking two slices
of that cake. It was this hullaballoo that drew Cyril's attention to
the evanescence of the cake of cakes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) face at once changed from
calm pride to a dreadful anxiety. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) eyes bulged out. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) tiny mouth
grew and grew, like a mouth in a nightmare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was no longer human; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
was a cake-eating tiger being balked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) prey. Nobody noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).
The officious fool of a woman persuaded Jennie to take the last slice
of the cake, which was quite a thin slice.

<p/>Then every one simultaneously noticed Cyril, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) gave a yell. It was
not the cry of a despairing soul who sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) beautiful iridescent
dream shattered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) feet; it was the cry of the strong, masterful
spirit, furious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) turned upon Jennie, sobbing, and snatched at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>)
cake. Unaccustomed to such behaviour from hosts, and being besides a
haughty put-you-in-your-place beauty of the future, Jennie defended her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>)
cake. After all, it was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) who had taken two slices at once. Cyril
hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) in the eye, and then crammed most of the slice of cake into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
enormous mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could not swallow it, nor even masticate it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
throat was rigid and tight. So the cake projected from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) red lips,
and big tears watered it. The most awful mess you can conceive! Jennie
wept loudly, and one or two others joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) in sympathy, but the rest
went on eating tranquilly, unmoved by the horror which transfixed their
elders.

<p/>A host to snatch food from a guest! A host to strike a guest! A
gentleman to strike a lady!

<p/>Constance whipped up Cyril from his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) chair and flew with him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) own
room -LRB-once Samuel's-RRB-, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) on the arm and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
was a very, very naughty boy and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't know what his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) father
would say. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took the food out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) disgusting mouth--or as much of
it as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could get at--and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), on the bed. Miss Jennie
was still in tears when, blushing scarlet and trying to smile,
Constance returned to the drawing-room. Jennie would not be appeased.
Happily Jennie's mother -LRB-being about to present Jennie with a little
brother--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) hoped-RRB- was not present. Miss Insull had promised to see
Jennie home, and it was decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) should go. Mr. Critchlow, in
high sardonic spirits, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) would go too; the three departed
together, heavily charged with Constance's love and apologies. Then all
pretended, and said loudly, that what had happened was naught, that
such things were always happening at children's parties. And visitors'
relatives asseverated that Cyril was a perfect darling and that really
Mrs. Povey must not ...

<p/>But the attempt to keep up appearance was a failure.

<p/>The Methuselah of visitors, a gaping girl of nearly eight years, walked
across the room to where Constance was standing, and said in a loud,
confidential, fatuous voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cyril HAS been a rude boy, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), Mrs. Povey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>The clumsiness of children is sometimes tragic.

<p/>Later, there was a trickling stream of fluffy bundles down the crooked
stairs and through the parlour and so out into King Street. And
Constance received many compliments and sundry appeals that darling
Cyril should be forgiven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you said that boy was in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bedroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel to
Constance, coming into the parlour when the last guest had gone. Each
avoided the other's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The little jockey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Jockey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the jockey</b></font>)</div>an essay in the playful, towards making
light of the jockey's sin!-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s been in search of Amy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) went to the top of the kitchen stairs and called out: <div class="bookquote">``Amy, is
Master Cyril down there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Cyril? No, mum. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was in the parlour a bit ago, after the
first and second lot had gone. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to go upstairs and be a good
boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Not for a few moments did the suspicion enter the minds of Samuel and
Constance that Cyril might be missing, that the house might not contain
Cyril. But having once entered, the suspicion became a certainty. Amy,
cross-examined, burst into sudden tears, admitting that the side-door
might have been open when, having sped `the second lot,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) criminally
left Cyril alone in the parlour in order to descend for an instant to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) kitchen. Dusk was gathering. Amy saw the defenceless innocent
wandering about all night in the deserted streets of a great city. A
similar vision with precise details of canals, tramcar-wheels, and
cellar-flaps, disturbed Constance. Samuel said that anyhow he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) could not
have got far, that some one was bound to remark and recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), and
restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>). ``Yes, of course,'' thought sensible Constance. <div class="bookquote">``But
supposing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all three searched the entire house again. Then, in the
drawing-room -LRB-which was in a sad condition of anticlimax-RRB- Amy exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, master! There's town-crier crossing the Square. Hadn't ye better
have him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cried?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Run out and stop him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance commanded.

<p/>And Amy flew.

<p/>Samuel and the aged town-crier parleyed at the side door, the women in
the background.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I canna' cry him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) without my bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>the crier</b></font>)</div>drawled the crier, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
shabby uniform. <div class="bookquote">``My bell's at wum -LRB-home-RRB-. I mun go and fetch my bell.
Yo' write it down on a bit o' paper for me so as I can read it, and
I'll foot off for my bell. Folk wouldna' listen to me if I hadna'
gotten my bell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus was Cyril cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and the girl were alone, <div class="bookquote">``there's no
use in you standing blubbering there. Get to work and clear up that
drawing-room, do! The child is sure to be found soon. Your master's
gone out, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Brave words! Constance aided in the drawing-room and kitchen. Theirs
was the woman's lot in a great crisis. Plates have always to be washed.

<p/>Very shortly afterwards, Samuel Povey came into the kitchen by the
underground passage which led past the two cellars to the yard and to
Brougham Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was carrying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) arms an obscene black mass.
This mass was Cyril, once white.

<p/>Constance screamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at liberty to give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings,
because Amy happened to be upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) isn't fit to touch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mr. Povey made as if to pass directly onward, ignoring the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherever did you find him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I found him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in the far cellar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, compelled to stop,
after all. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was down there with me yesterday, and it just occurred
to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might have gone there again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! All in the dark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'d lighted a candle, if you please! I'd left a candle-stick and a
box of matches handy because I hadn't finished that shelving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I can't think how ever he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dared go there
all alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, cynically. <div class="bookquote">``I can. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) simply did it to
frighten us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cyril!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance admonished the child. <div class="bookquote">``Cyril!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child showed no emotion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) face was an enigma. It might have
hidden sullenness or mere callous indifference, or a perfect
unconsciousness of sin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, grimly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't wash him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) relief yielding to
apprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Povey. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) moved off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Sam--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), I tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey repeated, threateningly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked with fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, <div class="bookquote">``has this sort of thing got to be dealt with,
or hasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) departed upstairs.

<p/>Constance overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) at the door of Cyril's bedroom.

<p/>Mr. Povey did not wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) eyes were blazing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) admonished her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cruelly. <div class="bookquote">``You get away downstairs,
mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) disappeared into the bedroom with his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) vile and helpless victim.

<p/>A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) popped his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) head out of the door. Constance was
disobeying him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) stepped into the passage and shut the door so that
Cyril should not hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now please do as I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hissed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Don't let's have
a scene, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) descended, slowly, weeping. And Mr. Povey retired again to the
place of execution.

<p/>Amy nearly fell on the top of Constance with a final tray of things
from the drawing-room. And Constance had to tell the girl that Cyril
was found. Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not resist the instinct to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) also
that the master had the affair in hand. Amy then wept.

<p/>After about an hour Mr. Povey at last reappeared. Constance was trying
to count silver teaspoons in the parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s in bed now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, with a magnificent attempt to be
nonchalant. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't go near him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But have you washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance whimpered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>replied the astonishing Mr. Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've punished him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, like a god who is above
human weaknesses. <div class="bookquote">``What did you expect me to do? Someone had to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes with the edge of the white apron which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
wearing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) new silk dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) surrendered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) accepted the
situation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) made the best of it. And all the evening was spent in
dismally and horribly pretending that their hearts were beating as one.
Mr. Povey's elaborate, cheery kindliness was extremely painful.

<p/>They went to bed, and in their bedroom Constance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stood close to
Samuel, suddenly dropped the pretence, and with eyes and voice of
anguish said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must let me look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>They faced each other. For a brief instant Cyril did not exist for
Constance. Samuel alone obsessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and yet Samuel seemed a strange,
unknown man. It was in Constance's life one of those crises when the
human soul seems to be on the very brink of mysterious and
disconcerting cognitions, and then, the wave recedes as inexplicably as
it surged up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, turning away lightly, as though to
imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was making tragedies out of nothing.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gave an involuntary gesture of almost childish relief.

<p/>Cyril slept calmly. It was a triumph for Mr. Povey.

<p/>Constance could not sleep. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lay darkly awake by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
secret being seemed to be a-quiver with emotion. Not exactly sorrow;
not exactly joy; an emotion more elemental than these! A sensation of
the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) life in that hour; troubling, anxious, yet not
sad! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said that Samuel was quite right, quite right. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
said that the poor little thing wasn't yet five years old, and that it
was monstrous. The two had to be reconciled. And they never could be
reconciled. Always she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would be between them, to reconcile them, and to
be crushed by their impact. Always she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would have to bear the burden of
both of them. There could be no ease for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), no surcease from a
tremendous preoccupation and responsibility. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not change
Samuel; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was right! And though Cyril was not yet five, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not change Cyril either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was just as
unchangeable as a growing plant. The thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother and Sophia
did not present itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt, however, somewhat as Mrs.
Baines had felt on historic occasions; but, being more softly kind,
younger, and less chafed by destiny, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was conscious of no
bitterness, conscious rather of a solemn blessedness.




<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>CRIME

<p/>I


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Master Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Amy protested, <div class="bookquote">``will you leave that fire alone?
It's not you that can mend my fires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>A boy of nine, great and heavy for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) years, with a full face and very
short hair, bent over the smoking grate. It was about five minutes to
eight on a chilly morning after Easter. Amy, hastily clad in blue, with
a rough brown apron, was setting the breakfast table. The boy turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, still bending.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up, Ame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) replied, smiling. Life being short, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) usually
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) Ame when they were alone together. <div class="bookquote">``Or I'll catch you one in
the eye with the poker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to be ashamed of yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``And you know your
mother told you to wash your feet this morning, and you haven't done.
Fine clothes is all very well, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who says I haven't washed my feet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>asked Cyril, guiltily.

<p/>Amy's mention of fine clothes referred to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was that
morning wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) Sunday suit for the first time on a week-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say you haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was more than three times his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) age still, but they had been treating
each other as intellectual equals for years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>asked Cyril, tired of the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you just don't, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril. <div class="bookquote">``And what about YOUR feet? I
should be sorry to see your feet, Ame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy was excusably annoyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``My feet are as clean
as yours any day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And I shall tell your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feet alone, and there ensued one of those
endless monotonous altercations on a single theme which occur so often
between intellectual equals when one is a young son of the house and
the other an established servant who adores him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). Refined minds would
have found the talk disgusting, but the sentiment of disgust seemed to
be unknown to either of the wranglers. At last, when Amy by superior
tactics had cornered him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), Cyril said suddenly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, go to hell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy banged down the spoon for the bacon gravy. <div class="bookquote">``Now I shall tell your
mother. Mark my words, this time I SHALL tell your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril felt that in truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had gone rather far. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was perfectly sure
that Amy would not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother. And yet, supposing that by some
freak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) nature she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did! The consequences would be unutterable; the
consequences would more than extinguish his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) private glory in the use of
such a dashing word. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) laughed, a rather silly, giggling laugh, to
reassure himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You daren't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daren't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said grimly. <div class="bookquote">``You'll see. _I_ don't know where you
learn! It fair beats me. But it isn't Amy Bates as is going to be sworn
at. As soon as ever your mother comes into this room!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>The door at the foot of the stairs creaked and Constance came into the
room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was wearing a dress of majenta merino, and a gold chain
descended from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) neck over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rich bosom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had scarcely aged in
five years. It would have been surprising if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had altered much, for
the years had passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head at an incredible rate. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) it
appeared only a few months since Cyril's first and last party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you all ready, my pet? Let me look at you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance greeted the
boy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) usual bright, soft energy.

<p/>Cyril glanced at Amy, who averted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head, putting spoons into three
saucers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) replied in a new voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you do what I told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy made a faint noise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lips, and departed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was saved once more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said to himself that never again would he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
permit his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) soul to be disturbed by any threat of old Ame's.

<p/>Constance's hand descended into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pocket and drew out a hard paper
packet, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) clapped on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) son's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pretended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) opened
the packet. It contained Congleton butterscotch, reputed a harmless
sweetmeat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``good! Oh! Thanks, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't begin eating them at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just one, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! And how often have I told you to keep your feet off that fender.
See how it's bent. And it's nobody but you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use being sorry if you persist in doing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, I had such a funny dream!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>They chatted until Amy came up the stairs with tea and bacon. The fire
had developed from black to clear red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run and tell father that breakfast is ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man half</b></font>)</div><p/>After a little delay a spectacled man of fifty, short and stoutish,
with grey hair and a small beard half grey and half black, entered from
the shop. Samuel had certainly very much aged, especially in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
gestures, which, however, were still quick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) sat down at once--his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
wife and son were already seated--and served the bacon with the rapid
assurance of one who needs not to inquire about tastes and appetites.
Not a word was said, except a brief grace by Samuel. But there was no
restraint. Samuel had a mild, benignant air. Constance's eyes were a
fountain of cheerfulness. The boy sat between them and ate steadily.

<p/>Mysterious creature, this child, mysteriously growing and growing in
the house! To his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a delicious joy at all times save when
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disobeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father. But now for quite a considerable period there
had been no serious collision. The boy seemed to be acquiring virtue as
well as sense. And really he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was charming. So big, truly enormous
-LRB-every one remarked on it-RRB-, and yet graceful, lithe, with a smile that
could ravish. And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was distinguished in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bearing. Without
depreciating Samuel in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faithful heart, Constance saw plainly the
singular differences between Samuel and the boy. Save that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was dark,
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) father's `dangerous look' came into those childish eyes
occasionally, Cyril had now scarcely any obvious resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was a Baines. This naturally deepened Constance's family
pride. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was mysterious to Constance, though probably not more so
than any other boy to any other parent. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was equally mysterious to
Samuel, but otherwise Mr. Povey had learned to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) in the light
of a parcel which he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was always attempting to wrap up in a piece of
paper imperceptibly too small. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) successfully covered the parcel
at one corner it burst out at another, and this went on for ever, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could never get the string on. Nevertheless, Mr. Povey had unabated
confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) skill as a parcel-wrapper. The boy was strangely
subtle at times, but then at times he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was astoundingly ingenuous, and
then his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dodges would not deceive the dullest. Mr. Povey knew himself
more than a match for his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) regarded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) as not an ordinary boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took it as a matter of course that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
boy should not be an ordinary boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never, or very rarely, praised
Cyril. Cyril thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father as a man who, in response to any
request, always began by answering with a thoughtful, serious <div class="bookquote">``No, I'm
afraid not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you haven't lost your appetite!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother commented.

<p/>Cyril grinned. <div class="bookquote">``Did you expect me to, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, as if vaguely recalling an unimportant fact.
<div class="bookquote">``It's to-day you begin to go to school, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish father wouldn't be such a chump!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril reflected. And,
considering that this commencement of school -LRB-real school, not a girls'
school, as once-RRB- had been the chief topic in the house for days, weeks;
considering that it now occupied and filled all hearts, Cyril's
reflection was excusable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, there's one thing you must always remember, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Povey. <div class="bookquote">``Promptness. Never be late either in going to school or in
coming home. And in order that you may have no excuse'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Povey
pressed on the word `excuse' as though condemning Cyril in
advance--<div class="bookquote">``here's something for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said the last words quickly,
with a sort of modest shame.

<p/>It was a silver watch and chain.

<p/>Cyril was staggered. So also was Constance, for Mr. Povey could keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own counsel. At long intervals he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would prove, thus, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was a
mighty soul, capable of sublime deeds. The watch was the unique
flowering of Mr. Povey's profound but harsh affection. It lay on the
table like a miracle. This day was a great day, a supremely exciting
day in Cyril's history, and not less so in the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) parents.

<p/>The watch killed its owner's appetite dead.

<p/>Routine was ignored that morning. Father did not go back into the shop.
At length the moment came when father put on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hat and overcoat to
take Cyril, and Cyril's watch and satchel, to the Endowed School, which
had quarters in the Wedgwood Institution close by. A solemn departure,
and Cyril could not pretend by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) demeanour that it was not! Constance
desired to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), but refrained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would not have liked it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
watched them from the window. Cyril was nearly as tall as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father;
that is to say, not nearly as tall, but creeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father's
shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) felt that the eyes of the town must be on the pair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
was very happy, and nervous.

<p/>At dinner-time a triumph seemed probable, and at tea-time, when Cyril
came home under a mortar-board hat and with a satchel full of new books
and a head full of new ideas, the triumph was actually and definitely
achieved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had been put into the third form, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
should soon be at the top of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was enchanted with the life of
school; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) liked the other boys, and it appeared that the other boys
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). The fact was that, with a new silver watch and a packet of
sweets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had begun his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) new career in the most advantageous
circumstances. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) possessed qualities which ensure success at
school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was big, and easy, with a captivating smile and a marked
aptitude to learn those things which boys insist on teaching to their
new comrades. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had muscle, a brave demeanour, and no conceit.

<p/>During tea the parlour began, to accustom itself to a new vocabulary,
containing such words as <div class="bookquote">``fellows,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`kept in,<div class="bookquote">``m' lines,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``rot,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``recess,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``jolly.''  (<font color='red'><b>some the parents</b></font>)</div>To some of these words the parents, especially Mr.
Povey, had an instinct to object, but they could not object, somehow
they did not seem to get an opportunity to object; they were carried
away on the torrent, and after all, their excitement and pleasure in
the exceeding romantic novelty of existence were just as intense and
nearly as ingenuous as their son's.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) demonstrated that unless he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was allowed to stay up later than
aforetime he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would not be able to do his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) home-work, and hence would not
keep that place in the school to which his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) talents entitled him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Mr.
Povey suggested, but only with half a heart, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) should get up
earlier in the morning. The proposal fell flat. Everybody knew and
admitted that nothing save the scorpions of absolute necessity, or a
tremendous occasion such as that particular morning's, would drive
Cyril from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) bed until the smell of bacon rose to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) from the
kitchen. The parlour table was consecrated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) lessons. It became
generally known that <div class="bookquote">``Cyril was doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) lessons.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father scanned
the new text-books while Cyril condescendingly explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) that
all others were superseded and worthless. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father contrived to
maintain an air of preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mental equilibrium, but not his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave it up, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who till that day had under his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father's
direction taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) nearly all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) knew, and Cyril passed above
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into regions of knowledge where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made no pretence of being able
to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/>When the lessons were done, and Cyril had wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) fingers on bits of
blotting-paper, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father had expressed qualified approval and had
gone into the shop, Cyril said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother, with that delicious
hesitation which overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) sometimes:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my pet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to do something for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you must promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it if I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you CAN. It isn't doing. It's NOT doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Cyril, out with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to come in and look at me after I'm asleep any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, you silly boy, what difference can it make to you if you're
asleep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to. It's like as if I was a baby. You'll have to stop
doing it some day, and so you may as well stop now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was thus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) meant to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) youth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was incomprehensibly happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continued to smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you'll promise, won't you, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) on the head with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thimble, lovingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) took the
gesture for consent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I shall trust you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said, ignoring this. <div class="bookquote">``Say `honour bright.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Honour bright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>With what a long caress her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) went up to bed on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) great sturdy legs! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was thankful that school had not
contaminated her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) adorable innocent. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have been Ame for
twenty-four hours, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) perhaps would not have hesitated to put butter
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mouth lest it should melt.

<p/>Mr. Povey and Constance talked late and low that night. They could
neither of them sleep; they had little desire to sleep. Constance's
face said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband: <div class="bookquote">``I've always stuck up for that boy, in spite
of your severities, and you see how right I was!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Povey's face
said: <div class="bookquote">``You see now the brilliant success of my system. You see how my
educational theories have justified themselves. Never been to a school
before, except that wretched little dame's school, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) goes
practically straight to the top of the third form--at nine years of
age!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>They discussed his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) future. There could be no sign of lunacy in
discussing his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) future up to a certain point, but each felt that to
discuss the ultimate career of a child nine years old would not be the
act of a sensible parent; only foolish parents would be so fond. Yet
each was dying to discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) ultimate career. Constance yielded first
to the temptation, as became her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Mr. Povey scoffed, and then, to
humour Constance, yielded also. The matter was soon fairly on the
carpet. Constance was relieved to find that Mr. Povey had no thought
whatever of putting Cyril in the shop. No; Mr. Povey did not desire to
chop wood with a razor. Their son must and would ascend. Doctor!
Solicitor! Barrister! Not barrister--barrister was fantastic. When they
had argued for about half an hour Mr. Povey intimated suddenly that the
conversation was unworthy of their practical commonsense, and went to
sleep.

<p/>II

<p/>Nobody really thought that this almost ideal condition of things would
persist: an enterprise commenced in such glory must surely traverse
periods of difficulty and even of temporary disaster. But no! Cyril
seemed to be made specially for school. Before Mr. Povey and Constance
had quite accustomed themselves to being the parents of 'a great lad,''
before Cyril had broken the glass of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) miraculous watch more than
once, the summer term had come to an end and there arrived the
excitations of the prize-giving, as it was called; for at that epoch
the smaller schools had not found the effrontery to dub the breaking-up
ceremony a ``speech-day.<div class="bookquote">'' This prize-giving furnished a particular joy
to Mr. and Mrs. Povey. Although the prizes were notoriously few in
number--partly to add to their significance, and partly to diminish
their cost -LRB-the foundation was poor-RRB---Cyril won a prize, a box of
geometrical instruments of precision; also he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) reached the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
form, and was marked for promotion to the formidable Fourth. Samuel and
Constance were bidden to the large hall of the Wedgwood Institution of
a summer afternoon, and they saw the whole Board of Governors raised on
a rostrum, and in the middle, in front of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) referred to, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
aristocratic London accent, as 'a beggarly array of rewards,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lad</b></font>)</div>the aged
and celebrated Sir Thomas Wilbraham Wilbraham, ex-M.P., last
respectable member of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) ancient line. And Sir Thomas gave the box of
instruments to Cyril, and shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). And everybody was very
well dressed. Samuel, who had never attended anything but a National
School, recalled the simple rigours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) own boyhood, and swelled.
For certainly, of all the parents present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was among the richest.
When, in the informal promiscuities which followed the prize
distribution, Cyril joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father and mother, sheepishly, they duly
did their best to make light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) achievements, and failed. The walls
of the hall were covered with specimens of the pupils' skill, and the
headmaster was observed to direct the attention of the mighty to a map
done by Cyril. Of course it was a map of Ireland, Ireland being the map
chosen by every map-drawing schoolboy who is free to choose. For a
third-form boy it was considered a masterpiece. In the shading of
mountains Cyril was already a prodigy. Never, it was said, had the
Macgillycuddy Reeks been indicated by a member of that school with a
more amazing subtle refinement than by the young Povey. From a proper
pride in themselves, from a proper fear lest they should be secretly
accused of ostentation by other parents, Samuel and Constance did not
go near that map. For the rest, they had lived with it for weeks, and
Samuel -LRB-who, after all, was determined not to be dirt under his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) son's
feet-RRB- had scratched a blot from it with a completeness that defied
inquisitive examination.

<p/>The fame of this map, added to the box of compasses and Cyril's own
desire, pointed to an artistic career. Cyril had always drawn and
daubed, and the drawing-master of the Endowed School, who was also
headmaster of the Art School, had suggested that the youth should
attend the Art School one night a week. Samuel, however, would not
listen to the idea; Cyril was too young. It is true that Cyril was too
young, but Samuel's real objection was to Cyril's going out alone in
the evening. On that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was adamant.

<p/>The Governors had recently made the discovery that a sports department
was necessary to a good school, and had rented a field for cricket,
football, and rounders up at Bleakridge, an innovation which
demonstrated that the town was moving with the rapid times. In June
this field was open after school hours till eight p.m. as well as on
Saturdays. The Squire learnt that Cyril had a talent for cricket, and
Cyril wished to practise in the evenings, and was quite ready to bind
himself with Bible oaths to rise at no matter what hour in the morning
for the purpose of home lessons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) scarcely expected his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father to say
``Yes' as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father never did say ``Yes,'' but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was obliged to ask.
Samuel nonplussed him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) by replying that on fine evenings, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) could
spare time from the shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) would go up to Bleakridge with his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) son.
Cyril did not like this in the least. Still, it might be tried. One
evening they went, actually, in the new steam-car which had superseded
the old horse-cars, and which travelled all the way to Longshaw, a
place that Cyril had only heard of. Samuel talked of the games played
in the Five Towns in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) day, of the Titanic sport of prison-bars, when
the team of one `bank' went forth to the challenge of another <div class="bookquote">``bank,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>preceded by a drum-and-fife band, and when, in the heat of the chase, a
man might jump into the canal to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursuer; Samuel had never
played at cricket.

<p/>Samuel, with a very young grandson of Fan -LRB-deceased-RRB-, sat in dignity on
the grass and watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cricketer for an hour and a half -LRB-while
Constance kept an eye on the shop and superintended its closing-RRB-.
Samuel then conducted Cyril home again. Two days later the father of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) own accord offered to repeat the experience. Cyril refused.
Disagreeable insinuations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was a baby in arms had been made at
school in the meantime.

<p/>Nevertheless, in other directions Cyril sometimes surprisingly
conquered. For instance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) came home one day with the information that
a dog that was not a bull-terrier was not worth calling a dog. Fan's
grandson had been carried off in earliest prime by a chicken-bone that
had pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) vitals, and Cyril did indeed persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father to buy
a bull-terrier. The animal was a superlative of forbidding ugliness,
but father and son vied with each other in stern critical praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
surpassing beauty, and Constance, from good nature, joined in the
pretence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was called Lion, and the shop, after one or two untoward
episodes, was absolutely closed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>).

<p/>But the most striking of Cyril's successes had to do with the question
of the annual holiday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) spoke of the sea soon after becoming a
schoolboy. It appeared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) complete ignorance of the sea
prejudicially affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) at school. Further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had always loved the
sea; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had drawn hundreds of three-masted ships with studding-sails
set, and knew the difference between a brig and a brigantine. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
first said: <div class="bookquote">``I say, mother, why can't we go to Llandudno instead of
Buxton this year?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) senses. For the
idea of going to any place other than Buxton was inconceivable! Had
they not always been to Buxton? What would their landlady say? How
could they ever look her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) in the face again? Besides ... well...! They
went to Llandudno, rather scared, and hardly knowing how the change had
come about. But they went. And it was the force of Cyril's will, Cyril
the theoretic cypher, that took them.

<p/>III

<p/>The removal of the Endowed School to more commodious premises in the
shape of Shawport Hall, an ancient mansion with fifty rooms and five
acres of land round about it, was not a change that quite pleased
Samuel or Constance. They admitted the hygienic advantages, but
Shawport Hall was three-quarters of a mile distant from St. Luke's
Square--in the hollow that separates Bursley from its suburb of
Hillport; whereas the Wedgwood Institution was scarcely a minute away.
It was as if Cyril, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) set off to Shawport Hall of a morning,
passed out of their sphere of influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was leagues off, doing they
knew not what. Further, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) dinner-hour was cut short by the extra time
needed for the journey to and fro, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) arrived late for tea; it may
be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) often arrived very late for tea; the whole machinery of
the meal was disturbed. These matters seemed to Samuel and Constance to
be of tremendous import, seemed to threaten the very foundations of
existence. Then they grew accustomed to the new order, and wondered
sometimes, when they passed the Wedgwood Institution and the
insalubrious Cock Yard--once sole playground of the boys--that the
school could ever have `managed' in the narrow quarters once allotted
to it.

<p/>Cyril, though constantly successful at school, a rising man, an
infallible bringer-home of excellent reports, and a regular taker of
prizes, became gradually less satisfactory in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) was `kept
in' occasionally, and although his (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) father pretended to hold that to be
kept in was to slur the honour of a spotless family, Cyril continued to
be kept in; a hardened sinner, lost to shame. But this was not the
worst. The worst undoubtedly was that Cyril was `getting rough.'' No
definite accusation could be laid against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>); the offence was general,
vague, everlasting; it was in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) did and said, in every gesture and
movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) shouted, whistled, sang, stamped, stumbled, lunged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
omitted such empty rites as saying ``Yes' or <div class="bookquote">``Please,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) replied gruffly and nonchalantly to polite questions, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
didn't reply until the questions were repeated, and even then with a
`lost' air that was not genuine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) shoelaces were a sad sight, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) finger-nails no sight at all for a decent woman; his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hair was as
rough as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) conduct; hardly at the pistol's point could he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) be forced
to put oil on it. In brief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was no longer the nice boy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) used
to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had unmistakably deteriorated. Grievous! But what can you
expect when YOUR boy is obliged, month after month and year after year,
to associate with other boys? After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a GOOD boy, said
Constance, often to herself and now and then to Samuel. For Constance,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) charm was eternally renewed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) smile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) frequent ingenuousness,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) funny self-conscious gesture when he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) wanted to `get round'
her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)--these characteristics remained; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pure heart remained; she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
could read that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) eyes. Samuel was inimical to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) tastes for
sports and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) triumphs therein. But Constance had pride in all that.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) liked to feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) and to gaze at him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), and to smell that faint,
uncleanly odour of sweat that hung in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) clothes.

<p/>In this condition he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) reached the advanced age of thirteen. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
parents, who despite their notion of themselves as wide-awake parents
were a simple pair, never suspected that his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) heart, conceived to be
still pure, had become a crawling, horrible mass of corruption.

<p/>One day the head-master called at the shop. Now, to see a head-master
walking about the town during school-hours is a startling spectacle,
and is apt to give you the same uncanny sensation as when, alone in a
room, you think you see something move which ought not to move. Mr.
Povey was startled. Mr. Povey had a thumping within his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) breast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hands and drew the head-master to the private corner where
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) desk was. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) almost said to the
head-master. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did not say it. The boot was emphatically not on
that leg. The head-master talked to Mr. Povey, in tones carefully low,
for about a quarter of an hour, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) closed the interview. Mr.
Povey escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) across the shop, and the head-master said with
ordinary loudness: <div class="bookquote">``Of course it's nothing. But my experience is that
it's just as well to be on the safe side, and I thought I'd tell you.
Forewarned is forearmed. I have other parents to see.''  (<font color='red'><b>the head-master</b></font>)</div>They shook hands
at the door. Then Mr. Povey stepped out on to the pavement and, in
front of the whole Square, detained an unwilling head-master for quite
another minute.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) face was deeply flushed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) returned into the shop. The
assistants bent closer over their work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did not instantly rush into
the parlour and communicate with Constance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had dropped into a way
of conducting many operations by his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) own unaided brain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) confidence
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) skill had increased with years. Further, at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
mind, there had established itself a vision of Mr. Povey as the seat of
government and of Constance and Cyril as a sort of permanent
opposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would not have admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) saw such a vision, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was utterly loyal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) wife; but it was there. This unconfessed
vision was one of several causes which had contributed to intensify his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
inherent tendency towards Machiavellianism and secretiveness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said
nothing to Constance, nothing to Cyril; but, happening to encounter Amy
in the showroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was inspired to interrogate her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sharply. The result
was that they descended to the cellar together, Amy weeping. Amy was
commanded to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tongue. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went in mortal fear of Mr.
Povey she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tongue.

<p/>Nothing occurred for several days. And then one morning--it was
Constance's birthday: children are nearly always horribly unlucky in
their choice of days for sin--Mr. Povey, having executed mysterious
movements in the shop after Cyril's departure to school, jammed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hat
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) head and ran forth in pursuit of Cyril, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) intercepted with
two other boys, at the corner of Oldcastle Street and Acre Passage.

<p/>Cyril stood as if turned into salt. <div class="bookquote">``Come back home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey,
grimly; and for the sake of the other boys: <div class="bookquote">``Please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall be late for school, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril weakly urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>They passed through the shop together, causing a terrific concealed
emotion, and then they did violence to Constance by appearing in the
parlour. Constance was engaged in cutting straws and ribbons to make a
straw-frame for a water-colour drawing of a moss-rose which her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
pure-hearted son had given her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) as a birthday present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--what--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) exclaimed. She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said no more at the moment because
she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was sure, from the faces of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) men, that the time was big with
fearful events.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your satchel off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey ordered coldly. <div class="bookquote">``And your
mortar-board,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) added with a peculiar intonation, as if glad thus to
prove that Cyril was one of those rude boys who have to be told to take
their hats off in a room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever's amiss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured under her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) breath, as Cyril
obeyed the command. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever's amiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Povey made no immediate answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was in charge of these
proceedings, and was very anxious to conduct them with dignity and with
complete effectiveness. Little fat man over fifty, with a wizened face,
grey-haired and grey-bearded, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as nervous as a youth. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart
beat furiously. And Constance, the portly matron who would never see
forty again, was just as nervous as a girl. Cyril had gone very white.
All three felt physically sick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What money have you got in your pockets?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey demanded, as a
commencement.

<p/>Cyril, who had had no opportunity to prepare his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) case, offered no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard what I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey thundered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got three-halfpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril murmured glumly, looking down at the
floor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lower lip seemed to hang precariously away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) gums.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you get that from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's part of what mother gave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a threepenny bit last week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance put in guiltily.
<div class="bookquote">``It was a long time since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had had any money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you gave it him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that's enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, quickly, and to
the boy: <div class="bookquote">``That's all you've got?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril was playing a hazardous game for the highest stakes, and under
grave disadvantages; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) acted for the best. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) guarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) own
interests as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could.

<p/>Mr. Povey found himself obliged to take a serious risk. <div class="bookquote">``Empty your
pockets, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril, perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had lost that particular game, emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, <div class="bookquote">``how often have I told you to change your
handkerchiefs oftener! Just look at this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Astonishing creature! She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was in the seventh hell of sick apprehension,
and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said that!

<p/>After the handkerchief emerged the common schoolboy stock of articles
useful and magic, and then, last, a silver florin!

<p/>Mr. Povey felt relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cyril!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>whimpered Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey.

<p/>The boy stepped forward awkwardly, and Constance, weeping, took the
coin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please look at it, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``And tell me if there's a
cross marked on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance's tears blurred the coin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had to wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) whispered faintly. <div class="bookquote">``There's something on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``Where did you steal it from?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of the till,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>answered Cyril.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever stolen anything out of the till before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your hands out of your pockets and stand up straight, if you can.
How often?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I don't know, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I blame myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, frankly. <div class="bookquote">``I blame myself. The till
ought always to be locked. All tills ought always to be locked. But we
felt we could trust the assistants. If anybody had told me that I ought
not to trust you, if anybody had told me that my own son would be the
thief, I should have--well, I don't know what I should have said!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Povey was quite justified in blaming himself. The fact was that the
functioning of that till was a patriarchal survival, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) ought to
have revolutionized, but which it had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) to
revolutionize, so accustomed to it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). In the time of John Baines,
the till, with its three bowls, two for silver and one for copper -LRB-gold
had never been put into it-RRB-, was invariably unlocked. The person in
charge of the shop took change from it for the assistants, or
temporarily authorized an assistant to do so. Gold was kept in a small
linen bag in a locked drawer of the desk. The contents of the till were
never checked by any system of book-keeping, as there was no system of
book-keeping; when all transactions, whether in payment or receipt, are
in cash--the Baineses never owed a penny save the quarterly wholesale
accounts, which were discharged instantly to the travellers--a system
of book-keeping is not indispensable. The till was situate immediately
at the entrance to the shop from the house; it was in the darkest part
of the shop, and the unfortunate Cyril had to pass it every day on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
way to school. The thing was a perfect device for the manufacture of
young criminals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how have you been spending this money?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey inquired.

<p/>Cyril's hands slipped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) pockets again. Then, noticing the lapse,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dragged them out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweets,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweets and things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``Well, now you can go down into the cinder-cellar
and bring up here all the things there are in that little box in the
corner. Off you go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>And off went Cyril. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had to swagger through the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I tell you, Master Cyril?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>Amy unwisely asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You've
copped it finely this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Copped' was a word which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had learned from Cyril.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, you old bitch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril growled.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) returned from the cellar, Amy said angrily:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you I should tell your father the next time you called me that,
and I shall. You mark my words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cant! cant!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) retorted. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I don't know who's been
canting? Cant! cant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Upstairs in the parlour Samuel was explaining the matter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife.
There had been a perfect epidemic of smoking in the school. The
head-master had discovered it and, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) hoped, stamped it out. What had
disturbed the head-master far more than the smoking was the fact that a
few boys had been found to possess somewhat costly pipes,
cigar-holders, or cigarette-holders. The head-master, wily, had not
confiscated these articles; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had merely informed the parents
concerned. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) opinion the articles came from one single source, a
generous thief; he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) left the parents to ascertain which of them had
brought a thief into the world.

<p/>Further information Mr. Povey had culled from Amy, and there could
remain no doubt that Cyril had been providing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) chums with the
utensils of smoking, the till supplying the means. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had told Amy that
the things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) secreted in the cellar had been presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) by
blood-brothers. But Mr. Povey did not believe that. Anyhow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had
marked every silver coin in the till for three nights, and had watched
the till in the mornings from behind the merino-pile; and the florin on
the parlour-table spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) success as a detective.

<p/>Constance felt guilty on behalf of Cyril. As Mr. Povey outlined his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
case she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not free herself from an entirely irrational sensation
of sin; at any rate of special responsibility. Cyril seemed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
boy and not Samuel's boy at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband's glance. This
was very odd.

<p/>Then Cyril returned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) parents composed their faces and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
deposited, next to the florin, a sham meerschaum pipe in a case, a
tobacco-pouch, a cigar of which one end had been charred but the other
not cut, and a half-empty packet of cigarettes without a label.

<p/>Nothing could be hid from Mr. Povey. The details were distressing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So Cyril is a liar and a thief, to say nothing of this smoking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Povey concluded.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) spoke as if Cyril had invented strange and monstrous sins. But deep
down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) heart a little voice was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), as regards the
smoking, that HE (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had set the example. Mr. Baines had never smoked. Mr.
Critchlow never smoked. Only men like Daniel smoked.

<p/>Thus far Mr. Povey had conducted the proceedings to his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own
satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had proved the crime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had made Cyril confess. The
whole affair lay revealed. Well--what next? Cyril ought to have
dissolved in repentance; something dramatic ought to have occurred. But
Cyril simply stood with hanging, sulky head, and gave no sign of proper
feeling.

<p/>Mr. Povey considered that, until something did happen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) must improve
the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we have trade getting worse every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) -LRB-it was true-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``and you are robbing your parents to make a beast of yourself, and
corrupting your companions! I wonder your mother never smelt you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never dreamt of such a thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, grievously.

<p/>Besides, a young man clever enough to rob a till is usually clever
enough to find out that the secret of safety in smoking is to use
cachous and not to keep the stuff in your pockets a minute longer than
you can help.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing how much money you have stolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey. <div class="bookquote">``A
thief!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>If Cyril had stolen cakes, jam, string, cigars, Mr. Povey would never
have said `thief' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did say it. But money! Money was different. And
a till was not a cupboard or a larder. A till was a till. Cyril had
struck at the very basis of society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And on your mother's birthday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey said further.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one thing I can do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can burn all this. Built on
lies! How dared you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) pitched into the fire--not the apparatus of crime, but the
water-colour drawing of a moss-rose and the straws and the blue ribbon
for bows at the corners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dared you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never gave me any money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril muttered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) thought the marking of coins a mean trick, and the dragging-in of
bad trade and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother's birthday roused a familiar devil that
usually slept quietly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey almost shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never gave me any money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>the devil repeated in a louder tone than
Cyril had employed.

<p/>-LRB-It was true. But Cyril `had only to ask' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would have received
all that was good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).-RRB-

<p/>Mr. Povey sprang up. Mr. Povey also had a devil. The two devils gazed
at each other for an instant; and then, noticing that Cyril's head was
above Mr. Povey's, the elder devil controlled itself. Mr. Povey had
suddenly had as much drama as he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get away to bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) with dignity.

<p/>Cyril went, defiantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)'s to have nothing but bread and water, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>Mr. Povey finished.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was, on the whole, pleased with himself.

<p/>Later in the day Constance reported, tearfully, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had been up to
Cyril and that Cyril had wept. Which was to Cyril's credit. But all
felt that life could never be the same again. During the remainder of
existence this unspeakable horror would lift its obscene form between
them. Constance had never been so unhappy. Occasionally, when by
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would rebel for a brief moment, as one rebels in secret
against a mummery which one is obliged to treat seriously. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would whisper, <div class="bookquote">``suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) HAS taken a few shillings out of the
till! What then? What does it matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But these moods of moral
insurrection against society and Mr. Povey were very transitory. They
were come and gone in a flash.




<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>ANOTHER CRIME

<p/>I


<p/>One night--it was late in the afternoon of the same year, about six
months after the tragedy of the florin--Samuel Povey was wakened up by
a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) shoulder and a voice that whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>The thief and the liar was standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) night-shirt by the bed.
Samuel's sleepy eyes could just descry him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) in the thick gloom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>questioned the father, gradually coming to consciousness.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you doing there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to wake mother up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy whispered. <div class="bookquote">``There's someone
been throwing dirt or something at our windows, and has been for a long
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Samuel stared at the dim form of the thief and liar. The boy was tall,
not in the least like a little boy; and yet, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
father as quite a little boy, a little `thing' in a night-shirt, with
childish gestures and childish inflections, and a childish, delicious,
quaint anxiety not to disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, who had lately been deprived
of sleep owing to an illness of Amy's which had demanded nursing. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
father had not so perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for years. In that instant the
conviction that Cyril was permanently unfit for human society finally
expired in the father's mind. Time had already weakened it very
considerably. The decision that, be Cyril what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) might, the summer
holiday must be taken as usual, had dealt it a fearful blow. And yet,
though Samuel and Constance had grown so accustomed to the
companionship of a criminal that they frequently lost memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
guilt for long periods, nevertheless the convention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) leprosy had
more or less persisted with Samuel until that moment: when it vanished
with strange suddenness, to Samuel's conscious relief.

<p/>There was a rain of pellets on the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>demanded Cyril, whispering dramatically. <div class="bookquote">``And it's been
like that on my window too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Samuel arose. <div class="bookquote">``Go back to your room!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) ordered in the same dramatic
whisper; but not as father to son--rather as conspirator to conspirator.

<p/>Constance slept. They could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) regular breathing.

<p/>Barefooted, the elderly gowned figure followed the younger, and one
after the other they creaked down the two steps which separated Cyril's
room from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) parents'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut the door quietly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel.

<p/>Cyril obeyed.

<p/>And then, having lighted Cyril's gas, Samuel drew the blind, unfastened
the catch of the window, and began to open it with many precautions of
silence. All the sashes in that house were difficult to manage. Cyril
stood close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father, shivering without knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) shivered,
astonished only that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to get back into bed
at once. It was, beyond doubt, the proudest hour of Cyril's career. In
addition to the mysterious circumstances of the night, there was in the
situation that thrill which always communicates itself to a father and
son when they are afoot together upon an enterprise unsuspected by the
woman from whom their lives have no secrets.

<p/>Samuel put his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) head out of the window.

<p/>A man was standing there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you, Samuel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The voice came low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>replied Samuel, cautiously. <div class="bookquote">``It's not Cousin Daniel, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Daniel Povey, curtly.

<p/>Samuel paused. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be down in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) said.

<p/>Cyril at length received the command to get back into bed at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever's up, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) asked joyously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I must put some things on and go and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) shut down the window on all the breezes that were pouring into the
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now quick, before I turn the gas out!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) admonished, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hand on the
gas-tap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll tell me in the morning, won't you, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, conquering his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) habitual impulse to say <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) crept back to the large bedroom to grope for clothes.

<p/>When, having descended to the parlour and lighted the gas there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
opened the side-door, expecting to let Cousin Daniel in, there was no
sign of Cousin Daniel. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) saw a figure standing at the corner
of the Square. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) whistled--Samuel had a singular faculty of whistling,
the envy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) son--and Daniel beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) nearly extinguished
the gas and then ran out, hatless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was wearing most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) clothes,
except his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) linen collar and necktie, and the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) coat was
turned up.

<p/>Daniel advanced before him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), without waiting, into the confectioner's
shop opposite. Being part of the most modern building in the Square,
Daniel's shop was provided with the new roll-down iron shutter, by
means of which you closed your establishment with a motion similar to
the winding of a large clock, instead of putting up twenty separate
shutters one by one as in the sixteenth century. The little portal in
the vast sheet of armour was ajar, and Daniel had passed into the gloom
beyond. At the same moment a policeman came along on his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) beat, cutting
off Mr. Povey from Daniel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, officer! Brrr!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Povey, gathering his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) dignity
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) and holding himself as though it was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) normal habit
to take exercise bareheaded and collarless in St. Luke's Square on cold
November nights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) behaved so because, if Daniel had desired the
services of a policeman, Daniel would of course have spoken to this one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goo' night, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>said the policeman, after recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Samuel, bold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A quarter-past one, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The policeman</b></font>)</div><p/>The policeman, leaving Samuel at the little open door, went forward
across the lamplit Square, and Samuel entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cousin's shop.

<p/>Daniel Povey was standing behind the door, and as Samuel came in he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
shut the door with a startling sudden movement. Save for the twinkle of
gas, the shop was in darkness. It had the empty appearance which a
well-managed confectioner's and baker's always has at night. The large
brass scales near the flour-bins glinted; and the glass cake-stands,
with scarce a tart among them, also caught the faint flare of the gas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Daniel? Anything wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Samuel asked, feeling
boyish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) usually did in the presence of Daniel.

<p/>The well-favoured white-haired man seized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with one hand by the
shoulder in a grip that convicted Samuel of frailty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Sam`l,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) low, pleasant voice, somewhat
altered by excitement. <div class="bookquote">``You know as my wife drinks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) stared defiantly at Samuel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``N--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel. <div class="bookquote">``That is--no one's ever SAID--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>This was true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) did not know that Mrs. Daniel Povey, at the age of
fifty, had definitely taken to drink. There had been rumours that she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
enjoyed a glass with too much gusto; but `drinks' meant more than that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) drinks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>Daniel Povey continued. <div class="bookquote">``And has done this last two year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, tremendously shocked by this
brutal rending of the cloak of decency.

<p/>Always, everybody had feigned to Daniel, and Daniel had feigned to
everybody, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife was as other wives. And now the man himself
had torn to pieces in a moment the veil of thirty years' weaving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if that was the worst!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>Daniel murmured reflectively, loosening
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grip.

<p/>Samuel was excessively disturbed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cousin was hinting at matters
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) himself, at any rate, had never hinted at even to Constance,
so abhorrent were they; matters unutterable, which hung like clouds in
the social atmosphere of the town, and of which at rare intervals one
conveyed one's cognizance, not by words, but by something scarce
perceptible in a glance, an accent. Not often is a town such as Bursley
starred with such a woman as Mrs. Daniel Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Samuel asked, trying to be firm.

<p/>And, <div class="bookquote">``What is wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) asked himself. <div class="bookquote">``What does all this mean, at
after one o'clock in the morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Sam`l,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>Daniel recommenced, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) shoulder again. <div class="bookquote">``I
went to Liverpool corn market to-day, and missed the last train, so I
came by mail from Crewe. And what do I find? I find Dick sitting on the
stairs in the dark pretty high naked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sitting on the stairs? Dick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! This is what I come home to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold on! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'s been in bed a couple of days with a feverish cold,
caught through lying in damp sheets as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mother had forgot to air.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) no supper to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) calls out. No answer. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
gets up to go down-stairs and see what's happened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) slips on th'
stairs and breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) knee, or puts it out or summat. Sat there hours,
seemingly! Couldn't walk neither up nor down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was your--wife--was Mrs.--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead drunk in the parlour, Sam`l.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the servant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Servant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>Daniel Povey laughed. <div class="bookquote">``We can't keep our servants. They
won't stay. YOU know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) did. Mrs. Daniel Povey's domestic methods and idiosyncrasies could
at any rate be freely discussed, and they were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have you done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done? Why, I picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) up in my arms and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) upstairs again.
And a fine job I had too! Here! Come here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Daniel strode impulsively across the shop--the counterflap was up--and
opened a door at the back. Samuel followed. Never before had he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
penetrated so far into his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cousin's secrets. On the left, within the
doorway, were the stairs, dark; on the right a shut door; and in front
an open door giving on to a yard. At the extremity of the yard he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
discerned a building, vaguely lit, and naked figures strangely moving
in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that? Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) asked sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the bakehouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>Daniel replied, as if surprised at such a
question. <div class="bookquote">``It's one of their long nights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Never, during the brief remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) life, did Samuel eat a
mouthful of common bread without recalling that midnight apparition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
had lived for half a century, and thoughtlessly eaten bread as though
loaves grew ready-made on trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>Daniel commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) ear, and caught a feeble, complaining wail from an upper
floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Dick! That is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Daniel Povey.

<p/>It sounded more like the distress of a child than of an adventurous
young man of twenty-four or so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) in pain? Haven't you fetched the doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>answered Daniel, with a vacant stare.

<p/>Samuel gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) closely for a second. And Daniel seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) very
old and helpless and pathetic, a man unequal to the situation in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) found himself; and yet, despite the dignified snow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) age,
wistfully boyish. Samuel thought swiftly: <div class="bookquote">``This has been too much for
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s almost out of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind. That's the explanation. Some one's
got to take charge, and I must.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>And all the courageous resolution of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) character braced itself to the crisis. Being without a collar,
being in slippers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) suspenders imperfectly fastened
anyhow,--these things seemed to be a part of the crisis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll just run upstairs and have a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, in a
matter-of-fact tone.

<p/>Daniel did not reply.

<p/>There was a glimmer at the top of the stairs. Samuel mounted, found the
gas-jet, and turned it on full. A dingy, dirty, untidy passage was
revealed, the very antechamber of discomfort. Guided by the moans,
Samuel entered a bedroom, which was in a shameful condition of neglect,
and lighted only by a nearly expired candle. Was it possible that a
house-mistress could so lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) self-respect? Samuel thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
own abode, meticulously and impeccably <div class="bookquote">``kept,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>and a hard bitterness
against Mrs. Daniel surged up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice from the bed; the moans ceased.

<p/>Samuel raised the candle.

<p/>Dick lay there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) face, on which was a beard of several days' growth,
distorted by anguish, sweating; his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) tousled brown hair was limp with
sweat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where the hell's the doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man demanded brusquely.
Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no curiosity about Samuel's presence; the one thing
that struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was that Samuel was not the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, soothingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) isn't here soon I shall be damn well dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick, in
feeble resentful anger. <div class="bookquote">``I can tell you that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Samuel deposited the candle and ran downstairs. <div class="bookquote">``I say, Daniel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
said, roused and hot, <div class="bookquote">``this is really ridiculous. Why on earth didn't
you fetch the doctor while you were waiting for me? Where's the missis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Daniel Povey was slowly emptying grains of Indian corn out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
jacket-pocket into one of the big receptacles behind the counter on the
baker's side of the shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had provisioned himself with Indian corn
as ammunition for Samuel's bedroom window; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was now returning the
surplus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye going for Harrop?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) questioned hesitatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Samuel exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Where's the missis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happen you'd better go and have a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harrop</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Daniel Povey.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harrop</b></font>)'s in th' parlour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) preceded Samuel to the shut door on the right. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) opened it the
parlour appeared in full illumination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here! Go in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Daniel.

<p/>Samuel went in, afraid. In a room as dishevelled and filthy as the
bedroom, Mrs. Daniel Povey lay stretched awkwardly on a worn horse-hair
sofa, her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) head thrown back, her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) face discoloured, her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) eyes bulging, her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
mouth wet and yawning: a sight horribly offensive. Samuel was
frightened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was struck with fear and with disgust. The singing gas
beat down ruthlessly on that dreadful figure. A wife and mother! The
lady of a house! The centre of order! The fount of healing! The balm
for worry, and the refuge of distress! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was vile. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) scanty
yellow-grey hair was dirty, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hollowed neck all grime, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands
abominable, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) black dress in decay. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the dishonour of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sex,
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) situation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) years. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a fouler obscenity than the
inexperienced Samuel had ever conceived. And by the door stood her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
husband, neat, spotless, almost stately, the man who for thirty years
had marshalled all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immense pride to suffer this woman, the jolly
man who had laughed through thick and thin! Samuel remembered when they
were married. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) remembered when, years after their marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was still as pretty, artificial, coquettish, and adamantine in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
caprices as a young harlot with a fool at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet. Time and the slow
wrath of God had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remained master of himself and approached her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); then stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stammered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Sam`l, lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man from the door. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt I've killed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harrop</b></font>)! I doubt I've killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harrop</b></font>)! I took and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Harrop</b></font>). I got her (<font color='blue'><b>Harrop</b></font>) by the
neck. And before I knew where I was, I'd done it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harrop</b></font>)'ll never drink
brandy again. This is what it's come to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved away.

<p/>All Samuel's flesh tingled as a heavy wave of emotion rolled through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) being. It was just as if some one had dealt him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) a blow unimaginably
tremendous. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) heart shivered, as a ship shivers at the mountainous
crash of the waters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was numbed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wanted to weep, to vomit, to
die, to sink away. But a voice was whispering to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``You will have to
go through with this. You are in charge of this.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) thought of HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
wife and child, innocently asleep in the cleanly pureness of HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) home.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) felt the roughness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) coat-collar round his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) neck and the
insecurity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) trousers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) passed out of the room, shutting the
door. And across the yard he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had a momentary glimpse of those nude
nocturnal forms, unconsciously attitudinizing in the bakehouse. And
down the stairs came the protests of Dick, driven by pain into a
monotonous silly blasphemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll fetch Harrop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, melancholily, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cousin.

<p/>The doctor's house was less than fifty yards off, and the doctor had a
night-bell, which, though he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a much older man than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father had
been at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still answered promptly. No need to bombard the
doctor's premises with Indian corn! While Samuel was parleying with the
doctor through a window, the question ran incessantly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) mind:
<div class="bookquote">``What about telling the police?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>But when, in advance of old Harrop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) returned to Daniel's shop, lo!
the policeman previously encountered had returned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) beat, and
Daniel was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) in the little doorway. No other soul was
about. Down King Street, along Wedgwood Street, up the Square, towards
Brougham Street, nothing but gaslamps burning with their everlasting
patience, and the blind facades of shops. Only in the second storey of
the Bank Building at the top of the Square a light showed mysteriously
through a blind. Somebody ill there!

<p/>The policeman was in a high state of nervous excitement. That had
happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) which had never happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) before. Of the sixty
policemen in Bursley, just he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had been chosen by fate to fit the socket
of destiny. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this, what's this, Mr. Povey?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) turned hastily to Samuel.
<div class="bookquote">``What's this as Mr. Councillor Povey is a-telling me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You come in, sergeant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Daniel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>said the policeman to Samuel, <div class="bookquote">``you mun' go along
Wedgwood Street, Mr. Povey, and bring my mate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) should be on Duck
Bank, by rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>It was astonishing, when once the stone had begun to roll, how quickly
it ran. In half an hour Samuel had actually parted from Daniel at the
police-office behind the Shambles, and was hurrying to rouse his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife
so that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could look after Dick Povey until he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) might be taken off to
Pirehill Infirmary, as old Harrop had instantly, on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), decreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) reflected in the turmoil of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) soul: <div class="bookquote">``God is not mocked!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) basic idea: God is not mocked! Daniel was a good fellow,
honourable, brilliant; a figure in the world. But what of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
licentious tongue? What of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) frequenting of bars? -LRB-How had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) come to
miss that train from Liverpool? How?-RRB- For many years he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Samuel, had
seen in Daniel a living refutation of the authenticity of the old
Hebrew menaces. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had been wrong, after all! God is not mocked!
And Samuel was aware of a revulsion in himself towards that strict
codified godliness from which, in thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had perhaps been slipping
away.

<p/>And with it all he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) felt, too, a certain officious self-importance, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) woke his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife and essayed to break the news to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in a manner
tactfully calm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had assisted at the most overwhelming event ever
known in the history of the town.

<p/>II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your muffler--I'll get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Cyril, run upstairs and
get father's muffler. You know the drawer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril ran. It behoved everybody, that morning, to be prompt and
efficient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't need any muffler, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel, coughing and
smothering the cough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! But, Sam--''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now please don't worry me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Samuel with frigid finality. <div class="bookquote">``I've
got quite enough--!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) did not finish.

<p/>Constance sighed as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband stepped, nervous and self-important,
out of the side-door into the street. It was early, not yet eight
o'clock, and the shop still unopened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father couldn't wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance said to Cyril when he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
thundered down the stairs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) heavy schoolboy boots. <div class="bookquote">``Give it to
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went to restore the muffler to its place.

<p/>The whole house was upset, and Amy still an invalid! Existence was
disturbed; there vaguely seemed to be a thousand novel things to be
done, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could think of nothing whatever that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) needed to do
at that moment; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) occupied herself with the muffler. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
reappeared Cyril had gone to school, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) who was usually a laggard. The
truth was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could no longer contain within himself a recital of
the night, and in particular of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had been the first to
hear the summons of the murderer on the window-pane. This imperious
news had to be imparted to somebody, as a preliminary to the thrilling
of the whole school; and Cyril had issued forth in search of an
appreciative and worthy confidant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was scarcely five minutes after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father.

<p/>In St. Luke's Square was a crowd of quite two hundred persons, standing
moveless in the November mud. The body of Mrs. Daniel Povey had already
been taken to the Tiger Hotel, and young Dick Povey was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) way in a
covered wagonette to Pirehill Infirmary on the other side of Knype. The
shop of the crime was closed, and the blinds drawn at the upper windows
of the house. There was absolutely nothing to be seen, not even a
policeman. Nevertheless the crowd stared with an extraordinary
obstinate attentiveness at the fatal building in Boulton Terrace.
Hypnotized by this face of bricks and mortar, it had apparently
forgotten all earthly ties, and, regardless of breakfast and a
livelihood, was determined to stare at it till the house fell down or
otherwise rendered up its secret. Most of its component individuals
wore neither overcoats nor collars, but were kept warm by a scarf round
the neck and by dint of forcing their fingers into the furthest inch of
their pockets. Then they would slowly lift one leg after the other.
Starers of infirm purpose would occasionally detach themselves from the
throng and sidle away, ashamed of their fickleness. But reinforcements
were continually arriving. And to these new-comers all that had been
said in gossip had to be repeated and repeated: the same questions, the
same answers, the same exclamations, the same proverbial philosophy,
the same prophecies recurred in all parts of the Square with an uncanny
iterance. Well-dressed men spoke to mere professional loiterers; for
this unparalleled and glorious sensation, whose uniqueness grew every
instant more impressive, brought out the essential brotherhood of
mankind. All had a peculiar feeling that the day was neither Sunday nor
week-day, but some eighth day of the week. Yet in the St. Luke's
Covered Market close by, the stall-keepers were preparing their stalls
just as though it were Saturday, just as though a Town Councillor had
not murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Councillor</b></font>) wife--at last! It was stated, and restated infinitely,
that the Povey baking had been taken over by Brindley, the second-best
baker and confectioner, who had a stall in the market. And it was
asserted, as a philosophical truth, and reasserted infinitely, that
there would have been no sense in wasting good food.

<p/>Samuel's emergence stirred the multitude. But Samuel passed up the
Square with a rapt expression; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) might have been under an illusion,
caused by the extreme gravity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) preoccupations, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was
crossing a deserted Square. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) hurried past the Bank and down the
Turnhill Road, to the private residence of <div class="bookquote">``Young Lawton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bank</b></font>)</div>son of the
deceased <div class="bookquote">``Lawyer Lawton.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>Young Lawton followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) father's
profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) was, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) father had been, the most successful
solicitor in the town -LRB-though reputed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) learned rivals to be a
fool-RRB-, but the custom of calling men by their occupations had died out
with horse-cars. Samuel caught young Lawton at his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) breakfast, and
presently drove with him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), in the Lawton buggy, to the police-station,
where their arrival electrified a crowd as large as that in St. Luke's
Square. Later, they drove together to Hanbridge, informally to brief a
barrister; and Samuel, not permitted to be present at the first part of
the interview between the solicitor and the barrister, was humbled
before the pomposity of legal etiquette.

<p/>It seemed to Samuel a game. The whole rigmarole of police and
police-cells and formalities seemed insincere. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cousin's case was
not like any other case, and, though formalities might be necessary, it
was rather absurd to pretend that it was like any other case. In what
manner it differed from other cases Samuel did not analytically
inquire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) thought young Lawton was self-important, and Daniel too
humble, in the colloquy of these two, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) endeavoured to indicate,
by the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) own demeanour, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) opinion the proper
relative tones had not been set. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) could not understand Daniel's
attitude, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) lacked imagination to realize what Daniel had been
through. After all, Daniel was not a murderer; his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) wife's death was due
to accident, was simply a mishap.

<p/>But in the crowded and stinking court-room of the Town Hall, Samuel
began to feel qualms. It occurred that the Stipendiary Magistrate was
sitting that morning at Bursley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Magistrate</b></font>) sat alone, as not one of the
Borough Justices cared to occupy the Bench while a Town Councillor was
in the dock. The Stipendiary, recently appointed, was a young man, from
the southern part of the county; and a Town Councillor of Bursley was
no more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Councillor</b></font>) than a petty tradesman to a man of fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
youthfully enthusiastic for the majesty and the impartiality of English
justice, and behaved as though the entire responsibility for the safety
of that vast fabric rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the barrister from
Hanbridge had had a historic quarrel at Cambridge, and their behaviour
to each other was a lesson to the vulgar in the art of chill and
consummate politeness. Young Lawton, having been to Oxford, secretly
scorned the pair of them, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) had engaged counsel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) of course
was precluded from adding to the eloquence, which chagrined him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>). These
three were the aristocracy of the court-room; they knew it; Samuel
Povey knew it; everybody knew it, and felt it. The barrister brought an
unexceptionable zeal to the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) duties; he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) referred in
suitable terms to Daniel's character and high position in the town, but
nothing could hide the fact that for him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) too his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) client was a petty
tradesman accused of simple murder. Naturally the Stipendiary was bound
to show that before the law all men are equal--the Town Councillor and
the common tippler; he (<font color='blue'><b>Councillor</b></font>) succeeded. The policeman gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Councillor</b></font>) evidence, and
the Inspector swore to what Daniel Povey had said when charged. The
hearing proceeded so smoothly and quickly that it seemed naught but an
empty rite, with Daniel as a lay figure in it. The Stipendiary achieved
marvellously the illusion that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>) a murder by a Town Councillor in
St. Luke's Square was quite an everyday matter. Bail was inconceivable,
and the barrister, being unable to suggest any reason why the
Stipendiary should grant a remand--indeed, there was no reason--Daniel
Povey was committed to the Stafford Assizes for trial. The Stipendiary
instantly turned to the consideration of an alleged offence against the
Factory Acts by a large local firm of potters. The young magistrate had
mistaken his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) vocation. With his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) steely calm, with his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) imperturbable
detachment from weak humanity, he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) ought to have been a General of the
Order of Jesuits.

<p/>Daniel was removed--he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) did not go: he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was removed, by two bare-headed
constables. Samuel wanted to have speech with him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), and could not. And
later, Samuel stood in the porch of the Town Hall, and Daniel appeared
out of a corridor, still in the keeping of two policemen, helmeted now.
And down below at the bottom of the broad flight of steps, up which
passed dancers on the nights of subscription balls, was a dense crowd,
held at bay by other policemen; and beyond the crowd a black van. And
Daniel--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cousin a sort of Christ between thieves--was hurried
past the privileged loafers in the corridor, and down the broad steps.
A murmuring wave agitated the crowd. Unkempt idlers and ne'er-do-wells
in corduroy leaped up like tigers in the air, and the policemen fought
them back furiously. And Daniel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) guardians shot through the
little living lane. Quick! Quick! For the captive is more sacred even
than a messiah. The law has him (<font color='blue'><b>messiah</b></font>) in charge! And like a feat of
prestidigitation Daniel disappeared into the blackness of the van. A
door slammed loudly, triumphantly, and a whip cracked. The crowd had
been balked. It was as though the crowd had yelled for Daniel's blood
and bones, and the faithful constables had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>messiah</b></font>) from their lust.

<p/>Yes, Samuel had qualms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had a sickness in the stomach.

<p/>The aged Superintendent of Police walked by, with the aged Rector. The
Rector was Daniel's friend. Never before had the Rector spoken to the
Nonconformist Samuel, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mr. Povey!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) ejaculated grievously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I'm afraid it's serious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Samuel stammered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) hated to admit that
it was serious, but the words came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) looked at the Superintendent of Police, expecting the Superintendent
to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) that it was not serious; but the Superintendent only
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Superintendent</b></font>) small white-bearded chin, saying nothing. The Rector shook
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) head, and shook a senile tear out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) eye.

<p/>After another chat with young Lawton, Samuel, on behalf of Daniel,
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) pose of the righteous man to whom a mere mishap has
occurred, and who is determined, with the lofty pride of innocence, to
indulge all the whims of the law, to be more royalist than the king. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
perceived that the law must be fought with its own weapons, that no
advantage must be surrendered, and every possible advantage seized. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
was truly astonished at himself that such a pose had ever been adopted.
His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) eyes were opened; he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saw things as they were.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) returned home through a Square that was more interested than ever in
the facade of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cousin's house. People were beginning to come from
Hanbridge, Knype, Longshaw, Turnhill, and villages such as Moorthorne,
to gaze at that facade. And the fourth edition of the Signal,
containing a full report of what the Stipendiary and the barrister had
said to each other, was being cried.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) shop he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) found customers, as absorbed in the trivialities of
purchase as though nothing whatever had happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was shocked; he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>)
resented their callousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm too busy now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said curtly to one who accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) wife called him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) in a low voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was standing behind the
till.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was ready to crush, and especially to crush indiscreet
babble in the shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was going to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) womanly
curiosity at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Huntbach is waiting for you in the parlour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Huntbach?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, from Longshaw.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``It's Mrs. Povey's cousin. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s
come to see about the funeral and so on, the--the inquest, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Samuel paused. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, has he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) defiantly. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). If
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) WANTS to see me, I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>That evening Constance learned all that was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mind of bitterness
against the memory of the dead woman whose failings had brought Daniel
Povey to Stafford gaol and Dick to the Pirehill Infirmary. Again and
again, in the ensuing days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) referred to the state of foul discomfort
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had discovered in Daniel's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) nursed a feud against all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) relatives, and when, after the inquest, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) gave evidence
full of resentment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was buried, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) vented an angry sigh of relief,
and said: ``Well, SHE<div class="bookquote">``S out of the way!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thenceforward he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had a mission,
religious in its solemn intensity, to defend and save Daniel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) took
the enterprise upon himself, spending the whole of himself upon it, to
the neglect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) business and the scorn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) health. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) lived
solely for Daniel's trial, pouring out money in preparation for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
thought and spoke of nothing else. The affair was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) one
preoccupation. And as the weeks passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) became more and more sure of
success, more and more sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would return with Daniel to Bursley
in triumph after the assize. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was convinced of the impossibility that
`anything should happen' to Daniel; the circumstances were too clear,
too overwhelmingly in Daniel's favour.

<p/>When Brindley, the second-best baker and confectioner, made an offer
for Daniel's business as a going concern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brindley</b></font>) was indignant at first.
Then Constance, and the lawyer, and Daniel -LRB-whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) saw on every
permitted occasion-RRB- between them persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) that if some arrangement
was not made, and made quickly, the business would lose all its value,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) consented, on Daniel's behalf, to a temporary agreement under
which Brindley should reopen the shop and manage it on certain terms
until Daniel regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) freedom towards the end of January. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would
not listen to Daniel's plaintive insistence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would never care to
be seen in Bursley again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pooh-poohed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) protested furiously
that the whole town was seething with sympathy for Daniel; and this was
true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) became Daniel's defending angel, rescuing Daniel from Daniel's
own weakness and apathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) became, indeed, Daniel.

<p/>One morning the shop-shutter was wound up, and Brindley, inflated with
the importance of controlling two establishments, strutted in and out
under the sign of Daniel Povey. And traffic in bread and cakes and
flour was resumed. Apparently the sea of time had risen and covered
Daniel and all that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Brindley</b></font>); for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brindley</b></font>) wife was under earth, and Dick
lingered at Pirehill, unable to stand, and Daniel was locked away.
Apparently, in the regular flow of the life of the Square, Daniel was
forgotten. But not in Samuel Povey's heart was he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) forgotten! There,
before an altar erected to the martyr, the sacred flame of a new faith
burned with fierce consistency. Samuel, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) greying middle-age, had
inherited the eternal youth of the apostle.

<p/>III

<p/>On the dark winter morning when Samuel set off to the grand assize,
Constance did not ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) views as to what protection he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would adopt
against the weather. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) silently ranged special underclothing, and by
the warmth of the fire, which for days she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had kept ablaze in the
bedroom, Samuel silently donned the special underclothing. Over that,
with particular fastidious care, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) best suit. Not a word was
spoken. Constance and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) were not estranged, but the relations between
them were in a state of feverish excitation. Samuel had had a cold on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) flat chest for weeks, and nothing that Constance could invent would
move it. A few days in bed or even in one room at a uniform temperature
would have surely worked the cure. Samuel, however, would not stay in
one room: he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) would not stay in the house, nor yet in Bursley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) would
take his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) lacerating cough on chilly trains to Stafford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had no ears
for reason; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) simply could not listen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was in a dream. After
Christmas a crisis came. Constance grew desperate. It was a battle
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) will and his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) that occurred one night when Constance,
marshalling all her (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) forces, suddenly insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) must go out no
more until he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was cured. In the fight Constance was scarcely
recognizable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) deliberately gave way to hysteria; she (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was no longer
soft and gentle; she (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) flung bitterness at him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) like vitriol; she (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) shrieked
like a common shrew. It seems almost incredible that Constance should
have gone so far; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), amid sobs, of putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) cousin before his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) wife and son, of not caring whether or not she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was left a widow as the result of this obstinacy. And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ended by
crying passionately that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might as well talk to a post. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might
just as well have talked to a post. Samuel answered quietly and coldly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that it was useless for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to put herself about, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
should act as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) thought fit. It was a most extraordinary scene, and
quite unique in their annals. Constance was beaten. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) accepted the
defeat, gradually controlling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sobs and changing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tone to the
tone of the vanquished. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in bed, kissing the rod. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
gravely kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>Henceforward she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew, in practice, what the inevitable, when you have
to live with it, may contain of anguish wretched and humiliating. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband was risking his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life, so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was absolutely convinced, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
could do nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had come to the bed-rock of Samuel's character.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt that, for the time being, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had a madman in the house, who
could not be treated according to ordinary principles. The continual
strain aged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) one source of relief was to talk with Cyril. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) without reserve, and the words `your father,<div class="bookquote">'' `your
father,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>were everlastingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) complaining tongue. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
utterly changed. Often she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would weep when alone.

<p/>Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) frequently forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been beaten. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no
notion of honourable warfare. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was always beginning again, always
firing under a flag of truce; and thus she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) constituted a very
inconvenient opponent. Samuel was obliged, while hardening on the main
point, to compromise on lesser questions. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too could be formidable,
and when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips took a certain pose, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes glowed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) would
have put on forty mufflers had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) commanded. Thus it was she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) who
arranged all the details of the supreme journey to Stafford. Samuel was
to drive to Knype, so as to avoid the rigours of the Loop Line train
from Bursley and the waiting on cold platforms. At Knype he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was to take
the express, and to travel first-class.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was dressed on that gas-lit morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) learnt bit by bit the
extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) elaborate preparations. The breakfast was a special
breakfast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had to eat it all. Then the cab came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) saw Amy
put hot bricks into it. Constance herself put goloshes over his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) boots,
not because it was damp, but because indiarubber keeps the feet warm.
Constance herself bandaged his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) neck, and unbuttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) waistcoat and
stuck an extra flannel under his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) dickey. Constance herself warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
woollen gloves, and enveloped him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) largest overcoat.

<p/>Samuel then saw Cyril getting ready to go out. <div class="bookquote">``Where are you off?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s going with you as far as Knype,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance grimly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'ll
see you into the train and then come back here in the cab.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had sprung this indignity upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) glared. Cyril glanced with
timid bravado from one to the other. Samuel had to yield.

<p/>Thus in the winter darkness--for it was not yet dawn--Samuel set forth
to the trial, escorted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) son. The reverberation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) appalling
cough from the cab was the last thing that Constance heard.

<p/>During most of the day Constance sat in ``Miss Insull's corner' in the
shop. Twenty years ago this very corner had been hers. But now, instead
of large millinery-boxes enwrapped in brown paper, it was shut off from
the rest of the counter by a rich screen of mahogany and ground-glass,
and within the enclosed space all the apparatus necessary to the
activity of Miss Insull had been provided for. However, it remained the
coldest part of the whole shop, as Miss Insull's fingers testified.
Constance established herself there more from a desire to do something,
to interfere in something, than from a necessity of supervising the
shop, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had said to Samuel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) would keep an eye on the
shop. Miss Insull, whose throne was usurped, had to sit by the stove
with less important creatures; she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) did not like it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) underlings
suffered accordingly.

<p/>It was a long day. Towards tea-time, just before Cyril was due from
school, Mr. Critchlow came surprisingly in. That is to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) arrival
was less of a surprise to Miss Insull and the rest of the staff than to
Constance. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had lately formed an irregular habit of popping in at
tea-time, to chat with Miss Insull. Mr. Critchlow was still defying
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) long, thin figure perfectly erect. His (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) features had
not altered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) hair and beard could not have been whiter than they
had been for years past. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) long white apron, and over that a
thick reefer jacket. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) long, knotty fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) carried a copy of
the Signal.

<p/>Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had not expected to find the corner occupied by Constance.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was sewing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it's you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) unpleasant, grating voice, not even
glancing at Miss Insull. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had gained the reputation of being the
rudest old man in Bursley. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) general demeanour expressed
indifference rather than rudeness. It was a manner that said: <div class="bookquote">``You've
got to take me as I am. I may be an egotist, hard, mean, and convinced;
but those who don't like it can lump it. I'm indifferent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) put one elbow on the top of the screen, showing the Signal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Critchlow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, primly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had acquired Samuel's
dislike of him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's begun!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) observed with mysterious glee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance said eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Is it in the paper already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had been far more disturbed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) husband's health than about
the trial of Daniel Povey for murder, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) interest in the trial was
of course tremendous. And this news, that it had actually begun,
thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't ye hear the Signal boy hollering just
now all over the Square?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), newspapers did not exist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) never had
the idea of opening one, never felt any curiosity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could not
satisfy, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could satisfy it at all, without the powerful aid of
the press. And even on this day it had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) that the
Signal might be worth opening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Critchlow. <div class="bookquote">``Seemingly it began at two o'clock--or
thereabouts.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) gave a moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) attention to a noisy gas-jet,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) carefully lowered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow; and they read the few brief
sentences, under their big heading, which described the formal
commencement of the trial of Daniel Povey for the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) wife.
<div class="bookquote">``There was some as said,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) remarked, pushing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) spectacles, <div class="bookquote">``that
grand jury would alter the charge, or summat!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) laughed, grimly
tolerant of the extreme absurdity. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) added contemplatively,
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) head to see if the assistants were listening. They were. It
would have been too much, on such a day, to expect a strict adherence
to the etiquette of the shop.

<p/>Constance had been hearing a good deal lately of grand juries, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
had understood nothing, nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) sought to understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad it's come on so soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``In a sense, that is! I
was afraid Sam might be kept at Stafford for days. Do you think it will
last long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow, positively. <div class="bookquote">``There's naught in it to spin
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then a silence, punctuated by the sound of stitching.

<p/>Constance would really have preferred not to converse with the old man;
but the desire for reassurance, for the calming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own fears,
forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) to speak, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) knew well that Mr. Critchlow was
precisely the last man in the town to give moral assistance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
thought it was wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope everything will be all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything'll be all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) said gaily. <div class="bookquote">``Everything'll be all
right. Only it'll be all wrong for Dan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever do you mean, Mr. Critchlow?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) protested.

<p/>Nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) reflected, could rouse pity in that heart, not even a
tragedy like Daniel's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) lip for having spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said in loud tones, frankly addressing the girls round the
stove as much as Constance. ``I've met with some rare good arguments
this new year, no mistake! There's been some as say that Dan never
meant to do it. That's as may be. But if it's a good reason for not
hanging, there's an end to capital punishment in this country. ``Never
meant'! There's a lot of 'em as `never meant'! Then I'm told as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was
a gallivanting woman and no housekeeper, and as often drunk as sober.
I'd no call to be told that. If strangling is a right punishment for a
wife as spends her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) time in drinking brandy instead of sweeping floors
and airing sheets, then Dan's safe. But I don't seem to see Judge
Lindley telling the jury as it is. I've been a juryman under Judge
Lindley myself--and more than once--and I don't seem to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), like!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) paused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mouth open. ``As for all them nobs,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) continued,
<div class="bookquote">``including th' rector, as have gone to Stafford to kiss the book and
swear that Dan's reputation is second to none--if they could ha' sworn
as Dan wasn't in th' house at all that night, if they could ha' sworn
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was in Jericho, there'd ha' been some sense in their going. But as
it is, they'd ha' done better to stop at home and mind their business.
Bless us! Sam wanted ME to go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) laughed again, in the faces of the horrified and angry women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm surprised at you, Mr. Critchlow! I really am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance exclaimed.

<p/>And the assistants inarticulately supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) with vague sounds. Miss
Insull got up and poked the stove. Every soul in the establishment was
loyally convinced that Daniel Povey would be acquitted, and to breathe
a doubt on the brightness of this certainty was a hideous crime. The
conviction was not within the domain of reason; it was an act of faith;
and arguments merely fretted, without in the slightest degree
disturbing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye may be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Critchlow gaily concurred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was very content.

<p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) shuffled round to leave the shop, Cyril entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Mr. Critchlow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril, sheepishly polite.

<p/>Mr. Critchlow gazed hard at the boy, then nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) head several times
rapidly, as though to say: <div class="bookquote">``Here's another fool in the making! So the
generations follow one another!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) made no answer to the salutation,
and departed.

<p/>Cyril ran round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother's corner, pitching his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) bag on to the
showroom stairs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) passed them. Taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unbuttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) overcoat with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cold hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's old Methuselah after?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance softly corrected him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) came in to tell me the
trial had started.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I knew that! A boy bought a paper and I saw it. I say, mother,
will father be in the paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then in a different tone: <div class="bookquote">``I say,
mother, what is there for tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) stomach had learnt exactly what there was for tea, the boy
began to show an immense and talkative curiosity in the trial. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would
not set himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) home-lessons. <div class="bookquote">``It's no use, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
can't.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They returned to the shop together, and Cyril would go every
moment to the door to listen for the cry of a newsboy. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hit
upon the idea that perhaps newsboys might be crying the special edition
of the Signal in the market-place, in front of the Town Hall, to the
neglect of St. Luke's Square. And nothing would satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) must
go forth and see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) went, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) overcoat, promising to run. The
shop waited with a strange anxiety. Cyril had created, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) restless
movements to and fro, an atmosphere of strained expectancy. It seemed
now as if the whole town stood with beating heart, fearful of tidings
and yet burning to get them. Constance pictured Stafford, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had
never seen, and a court of justice, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had never seen, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
husband and Daniel in it. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) waited.

<p/>Cyril ran in. <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) announced breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't take cold, now you're hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance advised.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would keep near the door. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ran off again.

<p/>And perhaps fifteen seconds after he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had gone, the strident cry of a
Signal boy was heard in the distance, faint and indistinct at first,
then clearer and louder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a paper!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the apprentice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>echoed Miss Insull.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Insull, just step out and get a
paper. Here's a halfpenny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The halfpenny passed quickly from one thimbled hand to another. Miss
Insull scurried.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) came in triumphantly with the sheet, which Constance tremblingly
took. Constance could not find the report at first. Miss Insull pointed
to it, and read--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Summing up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>Lower down, lower down! <div class="bookquote">``After an absence of thirty-five
minutes the jury found the prisoner guilty of murder, with a
recommendation to mercy. The judge assumed the black cap and pronounced
sentence of death, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would forward the recommendation to
the proper quarter.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril returned. <div class="bookquote">``Not yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was saying--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) saw the paper lying
on the counter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) crest fell.

<p/>Long after the shop was shut, Constance and Cyril waited in the parlour
for the arrival of the master of the house. Constance was in the
blackest despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) saw nothing but death around her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) thought:
misfortunes never come singly. Why did not Samuel come? All was ready
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>), everything that her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) imagination could suggest, in the way of
food, remedies, and the means of warmth. Amy was not allowed to go to
bed, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might be needed. Constance did not even hint that Cyril
should go to bed. The dark, dreadful minutes ticked themselves off on
the mantelpiece until only five minutes separated Constance from the
moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would not know what to do next. It was twenty-five
minutes past eleven. If at half-past Samuel did not appear, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
could not come that night, unless the last train from Stafford was
inconceivably late.

<p/>The sound of a carriage! It ceased at the door. Mother and son sprang
up.

<p/>Yes, it was Samuel! She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) once more. And the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
condition, moral and physical, terrified her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) great strapping son
and Amy helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) ever come down those stairs
again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>This thought lanced Constance's heart. The pain was come and
gone in a moment, but it had surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tranquil commonsense, which
was naturally opposed to, and gently scornful of, hysterical fears. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) puffed, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stoutness, up the stairs, that bland cheerfulness
of hers cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) an immense effort of will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was profoundly
troubled; great disasters seemed to be slowly approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) from all
quarters.

<p/>Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) send for the doctor? No. To do so would only be a concession
to the panic instinct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew exactly what was the matter with
Samuel: a severe cough persistently neglected, no more. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
expressed herself many times to inquirers, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'s never been what you
may call ill.''  (<font color='red'><b>inquirers</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) in bed and possetted him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>),
how frail and fragile he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) looked! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was so exhausted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) would
not even talk about the trial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'s not better to-morrow I shall send for the doctor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said to
herself. As for his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) getting up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) swore she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) in bed by
force if necessary.

<p/>IV

<p/>The next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was glad and proud that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had not yielded to a
scare. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was most strangely and obviously better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had slept
heavily, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had slept a little. True that Daniel was condemned to
death! Leaving Daniel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) fate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was conscious of joy springing
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) heart. How absurd to have asked herself: <div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) ever come down
those stairs again?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>!

<p/>A message reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) from the forgotten shop during the morning, that
Mr. Lawton had called to see Mr. Povey. Already Samuel had wanted to
arise, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had forbidden it in the tone of a woman who is
dangerous, and Samuel had been very reasonable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) now said that Mr.
Lawton must be asked up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) glanced round the bedroom. It was `done';
it was faultlessly correct as a sick chamber. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) agreed to the
introduction into it of the man from another sphere, and after a
preliminary minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) left the two to talk together. This visit of
young Lawton's was a dramatic proof of Samuel's importance, and of the
importance of the matter in hand. The august occasion demanded
etiquette, and etiquette said that a wife should depart from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to transact affairs beyond the grasp of a wife.

<p/>The idea of a petition to the Home Secretary took shape at this
interview, and before the day was out it had spread over the town and
over the Five Towns, and it was in the Signal. The Signal spoke of
Daniel Povey as `the condemned man.'' And the phrase startled the whole
district into an indignant agitation for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reprieve. The district
woke up to the fact that a Town Councillor, a figure in the world, an
honest tradesman of unspotted character, was cooped solitary in a
little cell at Stafford, waiting to be hanged by the neck till he (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) was
dead. The district determined that this must not and should not be.
Why! Dan Povey had actually once been Chairman of the Bursley Society
for the Prosecution of Felons, that association for annual eating and
drinking, whose members humorously called each other `felons'!
Impossible, monstrous, that an ex-chairman of the ``Felons' should be a
sentenced criminal!

<p/>However, there was nothing to fear. No Home Secretary would dare to run
counter to the jury's recommendation and the expressed wish of the
whole district. Besides, the Home Secretary's nephew was M.P. for the
Knype division. Of course a verdict of guilty had been inevitable.
Everybody recognized that now. Even Samuel and all the hottest
partisans of Daniel Povey recognized it. They talked as if they had
always foreseen it, directly contradicting all that they had said on
only the previous day. Without any sense of any inconsistency or of
shame, they took up an absolutely new position. The structure of blind
faith had once again crumbled at the assault of realities, and
unhealthy, un-English truths, the statement of which would have meant
ostracism twenty-four hours earlier, became suddenly the platitudes of
the Square and the market-place.

<p/>Despatch was necessary in the affair of the petition, for the condemned
man had but three Sundays. But there was delay at the beginning,
because neither young Lawton nor any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawton</b></font>) colleagues was acquainted
with the proper formula of a petition to the Home Secretary for the
reprieve of a criminal condemned to death. No such petition had been
made in the district within living memory. And at first, young Lawton
could not get sight or copy of any such petition anywhere, in the Five
Towns or out of them. Of course there must exist a proper formula, and
of course that formula and no other could be employed. Nobody was bold
enough to suggest that young Lawton should commence the petition, <div class="bookquote">``To
the Most Noble the Marquis of Welwyn, K.C.B., May it please your
Lordship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawton/Mr. Lawton</b></font>)</div>and end it, <div class="bookquote">``And your petitioners will ever pray!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawton/Mr. Lawton</b></font>)</div>and
insert between those phrases a simple appeal for the reprieve, with a
statement of reasons. No! the formula consecrated by tradition must be
found. And, after Daniel had arrived a day and a half nearer death, it
was found. A lawyer at Alnwick had the draft of a petition which had
secured for a murderer in Northumberland twenty years' penal servitude
instead of sudden death, and on request he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) lent it to young Lawton. The
prime movers in the petition felt that Daniel Povey was now as good as
saved. Hundreds of forms were printed to receive signatures, and these
forms, together with copies of the petition, were laid on the counters
of all the principal shops, not merely in Bursley, but in the other
towns. They were also to be found at the offices of the Signal, in
railway waiting-rooms, and in the various reading-rooms; and on the
second of Daniel's three Sundays they were exposed in the porches of
churches and chapels. Chapel-keepers and vergers would come to Samuel
and ask with the heavy inertia of their stupidity: <div class="bookquote">``About pens and ink,
sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>These officials had the air of audaciously disturbing the
sacrosanct routine of centuries in order to confer a favour.

<p/>Samuel continued to improve. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cough shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) less, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) appetite
increased. Constance allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to establish himself in the
drawing-room, which was next to the bedroom, and of which the grate was
particularly efficient. Here, in an old winter overcoat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) directed
the vast affair of the petition, which grew daily to vaster
proportions. Samuel dreamed of twenty thousand signatures. Each sheet
held twenty signatures, and several times a day he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) counted the sheets;
the supply of forms actually failed once, and Constance herself had to
hurry to the printers to order more. Samuel was put into a passion by
this carelessness of the printers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) offered Cyril sixpence for every
sheet of signatures which the boy would obtain. At first Cyril was too
shy to canvass, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father made him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) blush, and in a few hours Cyril
had developed into an eager canvasser. One whole day he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) stayed away
from school to canvas. Altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) earned over fifteen shillings,
quite honestly except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) got a companion to forge a couple of
signatures with addresses lacking at the end of a last sheet,
generously rewarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) with sixpence, the value of the entire sheet.

<p/>When Samuel had received a thousand sheets with twenty thousand
signatures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) heart on twenty-five thousand signatures. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
also announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) firm intention of accompanying young Lawton to
London with the petition. The petition had, in fact, become one of the
most remarkable petitions of modern times. So the Signal said. The
Signal gave a daily account of its progress, and its progress was
astonishing. In certain streets every householder had signed it. The
first sheets had been reserved for the signatures of members of
Parliament, ministers of religion, civic dignitaries, justices of the
peace, etc.. These sheets were nobly filled. The aged Rector of Bursley
signed first of all; after him (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) the Mayor of Bursley, as was right; then
sundry M.P.``s.

<p/>Samuel emerged from the drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) went into the parlour, and,
later, into the shop; and no evil consequence followed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cough was
nearly, but not quite, cured. The weather was extraordinarily mild for
the season. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) repeated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) should go with the petition to London;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) went; Constance could not validly oppose the journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), too,
was a little intoxicated by the petition. It weighed considerably over
a hundredweight. The crowning signature, that of the M.P. for Knype,
was duly obtained in London, and Samuel's one disappointment was that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) hope of twenty-five thousand signatures had fallen short of
realization--by only a few score. The few score could have been got had
not time urgently pressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) returned from London a man of mark, full
of confidence; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) cough was worse again.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) confidence in the power of public opinion and the inherent virtue
of justice might have proved to be well placed, had not the Home
Secretary happened to be one of your humane officials. The Marquis of
Welwyn was celebrated through every stratum of the governing classes
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) humane instincts, which were continually fighting against his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
sense of duty. Unfortunately his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sense of duty, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had inherited
from several centuries of ancestors, made havoc among his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) humane
instincts on nearly every occasion of conflict. It was reported that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
suffered horribly in consequence. Others also suffered, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was
never known to advise a remission of a sentence of flogging. Certain
capital sentences he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had commuted, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not commute Daniel
Povey's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not permit himself to be influenced by a wave of
popular sentiment, and assuredly not by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own nephew's signature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
gave to the case the patient, remorseless examination which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) gave to
every case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) spent a sleepless night in trying to discover a reason
for yielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) humane instincts, but without success. As Judge
Lindley remarked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) confidential report, the sole arguments in
favour of Daniel were provocation and his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) previous high character; and
these were no sort of an argument. The provocation was utterly
inadequate, and the previous high character was quite too ludicrously
beside the point. So once more the Marquis's humane instincts were
routed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) suffered horribly.

<p/>On the Sunday morning after the day on which the Signal had printed the
menu of Daniel Povey's supreme breakfast, and the exact length of the
`drop' which the executioner had administered to him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>), Constance and
Cyril stood together at the window of the large bedroom. The boy was in
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) best clothes; but Constance's garments gave no sign of the Sabbath.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wore a large apron over an old dress that was rather tight for her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was pale and looked ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril exclaimed suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Listen! I'm sure I can hear
the band.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) with a soundless movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) lips; and they both
glanced anxiously at the silent bed, Cyril with a gesture of apology
for having forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) must make no noise.

<p/>The strains of the band came from down King Street, in the direction of
St. Luke's Church. The music appeared to linger a long time in the
distance, and then it approached, growing louder, and the Bursley Town
Silver Prize Band passed under the window at the solemn pace of
Handel's <div class="bookquote">``Dead March.''  (<font color='red'><b>Handel</b></font>)</div>The effect of that requiem, heavy with its own
inherent beauty and with the vast weight of harrowing tradition, was to
wring the tears from Constance's eyes; they fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) aproned bosom,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) sank into a chair. And though, the cheeks of the trumpeters
were puffed out, and though the drummer had to protrude his (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) stomach and
arch his (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) spine backwards lest he (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) should tumble over his (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) drum, there was
majesty in the passage of the band. The boom of the drum, desolating
the interruptions of the melody, made sick the heart, but with a lofty
grief; and the dirge seemed to be weaving a purple pall that covered
every meanness.

<p/>The bandsmen were not all in black, but they all wore crape on their
sleeves and their instruments were knotted with crape. They carried in
their hats a black-edged card. Cyril held one of these cards in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
hands. It ran thus:

<p/>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF DANIEL POVEY A TOWN COUNCILLOR OF THIS TOWN
JUDICIALLY MURDERED AT 8 O``CLOCK IN THE MORNING 8TH FEBRUARY 1888 <div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
WAS MORE SINNED AGAINST THAN SINNING.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>In the wake of the band came the aged Rector, bare-headed, and wearing
a surplice over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) overcoat; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) thin white hair was disarranged by
the breeze that played in the chilly sunshine; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) hands were folded on
a gilt-edged book. A curate, churchwardens, and sidesmen followed. And
after these, tramping through the dark mud in a procession that had
apparently no end, wound the unofficial male multitude, nearly all in
mourning, and all, save the more aristocratic, carrying the memorial
card in their hats. Loafers, women, and children had collected on the
drying pavements, and a window just opposite Constance was ornamented
with the entire family of the landlord of the Sun Vaults. In the great
bar of the Vaults a barman was craning over the pitchpine screen that
secured privacy to drinkers. The procession continued without break,
eternally rising over the verge of King Street <div class="bookquote">``bank,''  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>and eternally
vanishing round the corner into St. Luke's Square; at intervals it was
punctuated by a clergyman, a Nonconformist minister, a town crier, a
group of foremen, or a few Rifle Volunteers. The watching crowd grew as
the procession lengthened. Then another band was heard, also playing
the march from Saul. The first band had now reached the top of the
Square, and was scarcely audible from King Street. The reiterated
glitter in the sun of memorial cards in hats gave the fanciful illusion
of an impossible whitish snake that was straggling across the town.
Three-quarters of an hour elapsed before the tail of the snake came
into view, and a rabble of unkempt boys closed in upon it, filling the
street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go to the drawing-room window, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Saul</b></font>) nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) crept out of the bedroom.

<p/>St. Luke's Square was a sea of hats and memorial cards. Most of the
occupiers of the Square had hung out flags at half-mast, and a flag at
half-mast was flying over the Town Hall in the distance. Sightseers
were at every window. The two bands had united at the top of the
Square; and behind them, on a North Staffordshire Railway lorry, stood
the white-clad Rector and several black figures. The Rector was
speaking; but only those close to the lorry could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) feeble
treble voice.

<p/>Such was the massive protest of Bursley against what Bursley regarded
as a callous injustice. The execution of Daniel Povey had most
genuinely excited the indignation of the town. That execution was not
only an injustice; it was an insult, a humiliating snub. And the worst
was that the rest of the country had really discovered no sympathetic
interest in the affair. Certain London papers, indeed, in commenting
casually on the execution, had slurred the morals and manners of the
Five Towns, professing to regard the district as notoriously beyond the
realm of the Ten Commandments. This had helped to render furious the
townsmen. This, as much as anything, had encouraged the spontaneous
outburst of feeling which had culminated in a St. Luke's Square full of
people with memorial cards in their hats. The demonstration had
scarcely been organized; it had somehow organized itself, employing the
places of worship and a few clubs as centres of gathering. And it
proved an immense success. There were seven or eight thousand people in
the Square, and the pity was that England as a whole could not have had
a glimpse of the spectacle. Since the execution of the elephant,
nothing had so profoundly agitated Bursley. Constance, who left the
bedroom momentarily for the drawing-room, reflected that the death and
burial of Cyril's honoured grandfather, though a resounding event, had
not caused one-tenth of the stir which she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) beheld. But then John Baines
had killed nobody.

<p/>The Rector spoke too long; every one felt that. But at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>)
finished. The bands performed the Doxology, and the immense multitudes
began to disperse by the eight streets that radiate from the Square. At
the same time one o'clock struck, and the public-houses opened with
their customary admirable promptitude. Respectable persons, of course,
ignored the public-houses and hastened homewards to a delayed dinner.
But in a town of over thirty thousand souls there are sufficient dregs
to fill all the public-houses on an occasion of ceremonial excitement.
Constance saw the bar of the Vaults crammed with individuals whose
sense of decent fitness was imperfect. The barman and the landlord and
the principal members of the landlord's family were hard put to it to
quench that funereal thirst. Constance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ate a little meal in the
bedroom, could not but witness the orgy. A bandsman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) silver
instrument was prominent at the counter. At five minutes to three the
Vaults spewed forth a squirt of roysterers who walked on the pavement
as on a tight-rope; among them was the bandsman, his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) silver instrument
only half enveloped in its bag of green serge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) established an
equilibrium in the gutter. It would not have mattered so seriously if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had not been a bandsman. The barman and the landlord pushed the
ultimate sot by force into the street and bolted the door -LRB-till six
o'clock-RRB- just as a policeman strolled along, the first policeman of the
day. It became known that similar scenes were enacting at the
thresholds of other inns. And the judicious were sad.

<p/>VI

<p/>When the altercation between the policeman and the musician in the
gutter was at its height, Samuel Povey became restless; but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
had scarcely stirred through the performances of the bands, it was
probably not the cries of the drunkard that had aroused him (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) had shown very little interest in the preliminaries of the great
demonstration. The flame of his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) passion for the case of Daniel Povey
seemed to have shot up on the day before the execution, and then to
have expired. On that day he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) went to Stafford in order, by permit of
the prison governor, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) cousin for the last time. His (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) condition
then was undoubtedly not far removed from monomania. ``Unhinged' was the
conventional expression which frequently rose in Constance's mind as a
description of the mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fought it down; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would not have it; it was too crude--with its associations. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
only admit that the case had `got on' his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind. A startling proof of
this was that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) actually suggested taking Cyril with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to see the
condemned man. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wished Cyril to see Daniel; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said gravely that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
thought Cyril ought to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). The proposal was monstrous,
inexplicable--or explicable only by the assumption that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mind, while
not unhinged, had temporarily lost its balance. Constance opposed an
absolute negative, and Samuel being in every way enfeebled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
overcame. As for Cyril, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was divided between fear and curiosity. On
the whole, perhaps Cyril regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would not be able to say at
school that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had had speech with the most celebrated killer of the
age on the day before his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) execution.

<p/>Samuel returned hysterical from Stafford. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) account of the scene,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) gave in a very loud voice, was a most absurd and yet pathetic
recital, obviously distorted by memory. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) came to the point of
the entrance of Dick Povey, who was still at the hospital, and who had
been specially driven to Stafford and carried into the prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) wept
without restraint. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) hysteria was painful in a very high degree.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) went to bed--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) own accord, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) cough had improved again.
And on the following day, the day of the execution, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) remained in bed
till the afternoon. In the evening the Rector sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) to the
Rectory to discuss the proposed demonstration. On the next day,
Saturday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) should not get up. Icy showers were sweeping the
town, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) cough was worse after the evening visit to the Rector.
Constance had no apprehensions about him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). The most dangerous part of
the winter was over, and there was nothing now to force him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) into
indiscretions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) said to herself calmly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) should stay in bed as
long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) liked, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) could not have too much repose after the
cruel fatigues, physical and spiritual, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had suffered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
cough was short, but not as troublesome as in the past; his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) face
flushed, dusky, and settled in gloom; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was slightly feverish,
with quick pulse and quick breathing--the symptoms of a renewed cold.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) passed a wakeful night, broken by brief dreams in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) talked.
At dawn he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had some hot food, asked what day it was, frowned, and
seemed to doze off at once. At eleven o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had refused food. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had intermittently dozed during the progress of the demonstration
and its orgiastic sequel.

<p/>Constance had food ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) waking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) approached the bed and
leaned over him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). The fever had increased somewhat, the breathing was
more rapid, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) lips were covered with tiny purple pimples. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
feebly shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) head, with a disgusted air, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mention of food. It
was this obstinate refusal of food which first alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). A little
uncomfortable suspicion shot up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>): Surely there's nothing the
MATTER with him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)?

<p/>Something--impossible to say what--caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to bend still lower, and
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) chest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) heard within that mysterious box a rapid
succession of thin, dry, crackling sounds: sounds such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would
have produced by rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) hair between her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) fingers close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ear.
The crepitation ceased, then recommenced, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) perceived that it
coincided with the intake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) coughed; the sounds were
intensified; a spasm of pain ran over his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) face; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) damp
hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pain in my side!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) whispered with difficulty.

<p/>Constance stepped into the drawing-room, where Cyril was sketching by
the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``go across and ask Dr. Harrop to come round at once.
And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) isn't in, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) new partner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it for father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now do as I say, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, sharply, adding: <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know what's the matter. Perhaps nothing. But I'm not satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>The venerable Harrop pronounced the word <div class="bookquote">``pneumonia.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Harrop/Harrop</b></font>)</div>It was acute
double pneumonia that Samuel had got. During the three worst months of
the year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had escaped the fatal perils which await a man with a flat
chest and a chronic cough, who ignores his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) condition and defies the
weather. But a journey of five hundred yards to the Rectory had been
one journey too many. The Rectory was so close to the shop that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had
not troubled to wrap himself up as for an excursion to Stafford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>)
survived the crisis of the disease and then died of toxsemia, caused by
a heart that would not do its duty by the blood. A casual death, scarce
noticed in the reaction after the great febrile demonstration! Besides,
Samuel Povey never could impose himself on the burgesses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lacked
individuality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was little. I have often laughed at Samuel Povey. But
I liked and respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was a very honest man. I have always been
glad to think that, at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) life, destiny took hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
and displayed, to the observant, the vein of greatness which runs
through every soul without exception. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) embraced a cause, lost it, and
died of it.




<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>THE WIDOW

<p/>I


<p/>Constance, alone in the parlour, stood expectant by the set tea-table.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was not wearing weeds; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), on the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
father, had talked of the various disadvantages of weeds; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother
had worn them unwillingly, and only because a public opinion not
sufficiently advanced had intimidated her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Constance had said: <div class="bookquote">``If ever
I'm a widow I won't wear them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>positively, in the tone of youth; and
Mrs. Baines had replied: <div class="bookquote">``I hope you won't, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div>That was over
twenty years ago, but Constance perfectly remembered. And now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was
a widow! How strange and how impressive was life! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
word; not positively, not without hesitations; for though times were
changed, Bursley was still Bursley; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had kept it.

<p/>This was the first Monday after Samuel's funeral. Existence in the
house had been resumed on the plane which would henceforth be the
normal plane. Constance had put on for tea a dress of black silk with a
jet brooch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) mother's. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hands, just meticulously washed, had
that feeling of being dirty which comes from roughening of the
epidermis caused by a day spent in fingering stuffs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been
`going through' Samuel's things, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own, and ranging all anew. It
was astonishing how little the man had collected, of <div class="bookquote">``things,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>in the
course of over half a century. All his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes were contained in two
long drawers and a short one. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the least possible quantity of
haberdashery and linen, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invariably took from the shop such
articles as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) required, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) required them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never
preserve what was done with. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possessed no jewellery save a set of
gold studs, a scarf-ring, and a wedding-ring; the wedding-ring was
buried with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Once, when Constance had offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) father's gold
watch and chain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had politely refused it, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) preferred
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) own--a silver watch -LRB-with a black cord-RRB- which kept excellent time;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had said later that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) might save the gold watch and chain for
Cyril when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was twenty-one. Beyond these trifles and a half-empty box
of cigars and a pair of spectacles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) left nothing personal to
himself. Some men leave behind them a litter which takes months to sift
and distribute. But Samuel had not the mania for owning. Constance put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) clothes in a box to be given away gradually -LRB-all except an overcoat
and handkerchiefs which might do for Cyril-RRB-; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) locked up the watch
and its black cord, the spectacles and the scarf-ring; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) gave the
gold studs to Cyril; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) climbed on a chair and hid the cigar-box on
the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wardrobe; and scarce a trace of Samuel remained!

<p/>By his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) own wish the funeral had been as simple and private as possible.
One or two distant relations, whom Constance scarcely knew and who
would probably not visit her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) again until she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) too was dead, came--and
went. And lo! the affair was over. The simple celerity of the funeral
would have satisfied even Samuel, whose tremendous self-esteem hid
itself so effectually behind such externals that nobody had ever fully
perceived it. Not even Constance quite knew Samuel's secret opinion of
Samuel. Constance was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had a ridiculous side, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
greatest lack had been a lack of spectacular dignity. Even in the
coffin, where nevertheless most people are finally effective, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
not been imposing--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) finicky little grey beard persistently
sticking up.

<p/>The vision of him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) coffin--there in the churchyard, just at the
end of King Street!--with the lid screwed down on that unimportant
beard, recurred frequently in the mind of the widow, as something
untrue and misleading. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had to say to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) is really
there! And that is why I have this particular feeling in my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) as an object pathetic and wistful, not majestic. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
genuinely thought that there could not exist another husband quite so
honest, quite so just, quite so reliable, quite so good, as Samuel had
been. What a conscience he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had! How he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) would try, and try, to be fair
with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)! Twenty years she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could remember, of ceaseless, constant
endeavour on his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) part to behave rightly to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could recall many
an occasion when he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had obviously checked himself, striving against his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
tendency to cold abruptness and to sullenness, in order to give her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) the
respect due to a wife. What loyalty was his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)! How she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could depend on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)! How much better he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) was than herself -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) thought with modesty-RRB-!

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) death was an amputation for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) faced it with calmness.
She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was not bowed with sorrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) did not nurse the idea that her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) life
was at an end; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) obstinately put it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>),
dwelling on Cyril. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) did not indulge in the enervating voluptuousness
of grief. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had begun in the first hours of bereavement by picturing
herself as one marked out for the blows of fate. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
father and her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) mother, and now her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband. Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) career seemed to be
punctuated by interments. But after a while her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) gentle commonsense came
to insist that most human beings lose their parents, and that every
marriage must end in either a widower or a widow, and that all careers
are punctuated by interments. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) not had nearly twenty-one years
of happy married life? -LRB-Twenty-one years--rolled up! The sudden thought
of their naive ignorance of life, hers and his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>), when they were first
married, brought tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) eyes. How wise and experienced she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was
now!-RRB- And had she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) not Cyril? Compared to many women, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was indeed
very fortunate.

<p/>The one visitation which had been specially hers was the disappearance
of Sophia. And yet even that was not worse than the death outright of
Sophia, was perhaps not so bad. For Sophia might return out of the
darkness. The blow of Sophia's flight had seemed unique when it was
fresh, and long afterwards; had seemed to separate the Baines family
from all other families in a particular shame. But at the age of
forty-three Constance had learnt that such events are not uncommon in
families, and strange sequels to them not unknown. Thinking often of
Sophia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hoped wildly and frequently.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked at the clock; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a little spasm of nervousness lest
Cyril might fail to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) word on that first day of their new
regular life together. And at the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) burst into the room,
invading it like an armed force, having previously laid waste the shop
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not late, mother! I'm not late!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) cried proudly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled warmly, happy in him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), drawing out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) balm and solace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
did not know that in that stout familiar body before him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was a
sensitive, trembling soul that clutched at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) ecstatically as the one
reality in the universe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) did not know that that evening meal,
partaken of without hurry after school had released him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), was to
be the ceremonial sign of their intimate unity and their
interdependence, a tender and delicious proof that they were `all in
all to each other': he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) saw only his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) tea, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was hungry--just
as hungry as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father were not scarcely yet cold in the grave.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) saw obscurely that the occasion demanded something not quite
ordinary, and so exerted himself to be boyishly charming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to herself `how good he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) felt at ease and confident in
the future, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) detected beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) customary judicial,
impartial mask a clear desire to spoil him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/>After tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) regretfully left him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) home-lessons, in order to
go into the shop. The shop was the great unsolved question. What was
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to do with the shop? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to continue the business or to sell
it? With the fortunes of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) aunt, and the economies of
twenty years, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had more than sufficient means. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was indeed rich,
according to the standards of the Square; nay, wealthy! Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was under no material compulsion to keep the shop. Moreover, to keep it
would mean personal superintendence and the burden of responsibility,
from which her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) calm lethargy shrank. On the other hand, to dispose of
the business would mean the breaking of ties and leaving the premises:
and from this also she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shrank. Young Lawton, without being asked, had
advised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to sell. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not want to sell. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted the
impossible: that matters should proceed in the future as in the past,
that Samuel's death should change nothing save in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart.

<p/>In the meantime Miss Insull was priceless. Constance thoroughly
understood one side of the shop; but Miss Insull understood both, and
the finance of it also. Miss Insull could have directed the
establishment with credit, if not with brilliance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was indeed
directing it at that moment. Constance, however, felt jealous of Miss
Insull; she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was conscious of a slight antipathy towards the faithful
one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) did not care to be in the hands of Miss Insull.

<p/>There were one or two customers at the millinery counter. They greeted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) with a deplorable copiousness of tact. Most tactfully they avoided
any reference to Constance's loss; but by their tone, their glances, at
Constance and at each other, and their heroically restrained sighs,
they spread desolation as though they had been spreading ashes instead
of butter on bread. The assistants, too, had a special demeanour for
the poor lone widow which was excessively trying to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) wished to
be natural, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) would have succeeded, had they not all of them
apparently conspired together to make her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) task impossible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) moved away to the other side of the shop, to Samuel's desk, at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) used to stand, staring absently out of the little window into
King Street while murmurously casting figures. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) lighted the gas-jet
there, arranged the light exactly to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and then lifted the
large flap of the desk and drew forth some account books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Insull!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) called, in a low, clear voice, with a touch of
haughtiness and a touch of command in it. The pose, a comical
contradiction of Constance's benevolent character, was deliberately
adopted; it illustrated the effects of jealousy on even the softest
disposition.

<p/>Miss Insull responded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had no alternative but to respond. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>)
gave no sign of resenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) employer's attitude. But then Miss Insull
seldom did give any sign of being human.

<p/>The customers departed, one after another, obsequiously sped by the
assistants, who thereupon lowered the gases somewhat, according to
secular rule; and in the dim eclipse, as they restored boxes to
shelves, they could hear the tranquil, regular, half-whispered
conversation of the two women at the desk, discussing accounts; and
then the chink of gold.

<p/>Suddenly there was an irruption. One of the assistants sprang
instinctively to the gas; but on perceiving that the disturber of peace
was only a slatternly girl, hatless and imperfectly clean, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) decided
to leave the gas as it was, and put on a condescending, suspicious
demeanour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, can I speak to the missis?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, breathlessly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to be about eighteen years of age, fat and plain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blue
frock was torn, and over it she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a rough brown apron, caught up at
one corner to the waist. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bare forearms were of brick-red colour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the assistant</b></font>)</div>demanded the assistant.

<p/>Miss Insull looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) shoulder across the shop. <div class="bookquote">``It must be
Maggie's--Mrs. Hollins's daughter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>said Miss Insull under her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, leaving the desk instantly; and to
the girl, who stood sturdily holding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own against the group of
assistants: <div class="bookquote">``You are Mrs. Hollins's daughter, aren't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>assistants</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's your name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie, mum. And, if you please, mother's sent me to ask if you'll
kindly give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a funeral card.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A funeral card?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Of Mr. Povey. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s been expecting of one, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought as how
perhaps you'd forgotten it, especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wasn't asked to the
funeral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl stopped.

<p/>Constance perceived that by mere negligence she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had seriously wounded
the feelings of Maggie, senior. The truth was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never thought of
Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ought to have remembered that funeral cards were almost the
sole ornamentation of Maggie's abominable cottage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) replied after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Insull, there are a few
cards left in the desk, aren't there? Please put me one in an envelope
for Mrs. Hollins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gave the heavily bordered envelope to the ruddy wench, who enfolded
it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) apron, and with hurried, shy thanks ran off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell your mother I send her (<font color='blue'><b>Hollins</b></font>) a card with pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance called
after the girl.

<p/>The strangeness of the hazards of life made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thoughtful. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to
whom Maggie had always seemed an old woman, was a widow, but Maggie's
husband survived as a lusty invalid. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guessed that Maggie,
vilely struggling in squalor and poverty, was somehow happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
frowsy, careless way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went back to the accounts, dreaming.

<p/>II

<p/>When the shop had been closed, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own critical and precise
superintendence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) extinguished the last gas in it and returned to
the parlour, wondering where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might discover some entirely reliable
man or boy to deal with the shutters night and morning. Samuel had
ordinarily dealt with the shutters himself, and on extraordinary
occasions and during holidays Miss Insull and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) subordinates
had struggled with their unwieldiness. But the extraordinary occasion
had now become ordinary, and Miss Insull could not be expected to
continue indefinitely in the functions of a male. Constance had a mind
to engage an errand-boy, a luxury against which Samuel had always set
his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) did not dream of asking the herculean Cyril to open and
shut shop.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had apparently finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) home-lessons. The books were pushed
aside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was sketching in lead-pencil on a drawing-block. To the
right of the fireplace, over the sofa, there hung an engraving after
Landseer, showing a lonely stag paddling into a lake. The stag at eve
had drunk or was about to drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) fill, and Cyril was copying him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
had already indicated a flight of birds in the middle distance; vague
birds on the wing being easier than detailed stags, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had begun with
the birds.

<p/>Constance put a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Finished your lessons?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>)
murmured caressingly.

<p/>Before speaking, Cyril gazed up at the picture with a frowning, busy
expression, and then replied in an absent-minded voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>And after a pause: <div class="bookquote">``Except my arithmetic. I shall do that in the
morning before breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cyril!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) protested.

<p/>It had been a positive ordinance, for a long time past, that there
should be no sketching until lessons were done. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father's
lifetime Cyril had never dared to break it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) block, feigning an intense absorption. Constance's
hand slipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) wanted to command him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) formally to
resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) lessons. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) feared an argument; she (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>)
mistrusted herself. And, moreover, it was so soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) father's
death!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you won't have time to-morrow morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) said weakly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) retorted superiorly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then, in a
cajoling tone: <div class="bookquote">``I've wanted to do that stag for ages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) sighed and sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) rocking-chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) went on sketching,
rubbing out, and making queer expostulatory noises against his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pencil,
or against the difficulties needlessly invented by Sir Edwin Landseer.
Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) rose and changed the position of the gas-bracket, staring
fiercely at the engraving as though it had committed a sin.

<p/>Amy came to lay the supper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Landseer</b></font>) did not acknowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) existed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Master Cyril, after you with that table, if you please!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
announced herself brusquely, with the privilege of an old servant and a
woman who would never see thirty again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a nuisance you are, Amy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) gruffly answered. <div class="bookquote">``Look here,
mother, can't Amy lay the cloth on that half of the table? I'm right in
the middle of my drawing. There's plenty of room there for two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) seemed not to be aware that, in the phrase `plenty of room for two,''
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had made a callous reference to their loss. The fact was, there WAS
plenty of room for two.

<p/>Constance said quickly: <div class="bookquote">``Very well, Amy. For this once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy grunted, but obeyed.

<p/>Constance had to summon him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) twice from art to nourishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ate with
rapidity, frequently regarding the picture with half-shut, searching
eyes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) refilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) glass with water, and put
it next to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) sketching-block.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You surely aren't thinking of beginning to paint at this time of
night!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance exclaimed, astonished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh YES, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) fretfully appealed. <div class="bookquote">``It's not late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Another positive ordinance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) father's had been that there should
be nothing after supper except bed. Nine o'clock was the latest
permissible moment for going to bed. It was now less than a quarter to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It only wants twelve minutes to nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance pointed out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what if it does?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I do hope you are going to be a good boy, and
not cause your mother anxiety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said it too kindly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said sullenly: <div class="bookquote">``I do think you might let me finish it. I've begun
it. It won't take me long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) made the mistake of leaving the main point. <div class="bookquote">``How can you possibly
choose your colours properly by gas-light?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to do it in sepia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) replied in triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It mustn't occur again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) thanked God for a good supper, and sprang to the harmonium, where
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) paint-box was. Amy cleared away. Constance did crochet-work. There
was silence. The clock struck nine, and it also struck half-past nine.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) repeatedly. At ten minutes to ten she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said persuasively:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Cyril, when the clock strikes ten I shall really put the gas out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The clock struck ten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a mo, half a mo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I've done! I've done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand was arrested.

<p/>Another four minutes elapsed, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) jumped up. <div class="bookquote">``There you are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said proudly, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) the block. And all his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) gestures were full
of grace and cajolery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance said, rather indifferently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you care for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), but with a bright
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I care for your health,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Just look at that clock!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) sat down in the other rocking-chair, deliberately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Cyril!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mother, I suppose you'll let me take my boots off!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said it
with teasing good-humour.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) good night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wanted to cling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), so
affectionate was his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) kiss; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not throw off the habits of
restraint which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been originally taught and had all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) life
practised. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) keenly regretted the inability.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bedroom, alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) movements as he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) undressed.
The door between the two rooms was unlatched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had to control a
desire to open it ever so little and peep at him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would not have
liked that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) could have enriched her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart beyond all hope, and at no
cost to himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) power. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not cling
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) with that heart of hers, while
moving sedately up and down the room, alone. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
through the solid wood of the door. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got heavily into bed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought with placid anxiety, in the dark: <div class="bookquote">``I shall have to be firm
with Cyril.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought also, simultaneously: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) really must be a
good boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) MUST.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) passionately, without shame! Lying
alone there in the dark, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could be as unrestrained and girlish as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart chose. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) loosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hold she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) instantly saw the boy's
father arranged in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) coffin, or flitting about the room. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would hug that vision too, for the pleasure of the pain it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>III

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was reassured as to Cyril during the next few days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) did not
attempt to repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) ingenious naughtiness of the Monday evening, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) came directly home for tea; moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had, as a kind of miracle
performed to dazzle her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), actually arisen early on the Tuesday morning
and done his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) arithmetic. To express her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
manufactured a specially elaborate straw-frame for the sketch after Sir
Edwin Landseer, and had hung it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bedroom: an honour which Cyril
appreciated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was as happy as a woman suffering from a recent
amputation can be; and compared with the long nightmare created by
Samuel's monomania and illness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) existence seemed to be now a
beneficent calm.

<p/>Cyril, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought, had realized the importance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes of tea, of
that evening hour and that companionship which were for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) the
flowering of the day. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had such confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) goodness that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would pour the boiling water on the Horniman tea-leaves even before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) arrived: certainty could not be more sure. And then, on the Friday
of the first week, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was late! He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) bounded in, after dark, and the
state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) clothes indicated too clearly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had been playing
football in the mud that was a grassy field in summer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been kept in, my boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) asked, for the sake of form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said casually. <div class="bookquote">``We were just kicking the ball about a
bit. Am I late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better go and tidy yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, not replying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) question.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't sit down in that state. And I'll have some fresh tea made.
This is spoilt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sacred tea--the institution which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wanted to hallow by long
habit, and which was to count before everything with both of them--had
been carelessly sacrificed to the kicking of a football in mud! And his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
father buried not ten days! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was wounded: a deep, clean, dangerous
wound that would not bleed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tried to be glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had not lied;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) might easily have lied, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had been detained for a fault
and could not help being late. No! He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was not given to lying; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would
lie, like any human being, when a great occasion demanded such
prudence, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was not a liar; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) might fairly be called a truthful
boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tried to be glad, and did not succeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would have
preferred him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to have lied.

<p/>Amy, grumbling, had to boil more water.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) returned to the parlour, superficially cleaned, Constance
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to apologize in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) roundabout boyish way; at any rate to
woo and wheedle her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), to show by some gesture that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was conscious of
having put an affront on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) attitude was quite otherwise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
attitude was rather brusque and overbearing and noisy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ate a very
considerable amount of jam, far too quickly, and then asked for more,
in a tone of a monarch who calls for his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) own. And ere tea was finished
he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) said boldly, apropos of nothing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, mother, you'll just have to let me go to the School of Art
after Easter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with a fixed challenge in his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) meant, by the School of Art, the evening classes at the School of
Art. His (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) father had decided absolutely against the project. His (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) father
had said that it would interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) lessons, would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) up
too late at night, and involve absence from home in the evening. The
last had always been the real objection. His (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) father had not been able
to believe that Cyril's desire to study art sprang purely from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) love
of art; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could not avoid suspecting that it was a plan to obtain
freedom in the evenings--that freedom which Samuel had invariably
forbidden. In all Cyril's suggestions Samuel had been ready to detect
the same scheme lurking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had finally said that when Cyril left
school and took to a vocation, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could study art at night if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
chose, but not before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what your father said!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mother! That's all very well! I'm sure father would have agreed.
If I'm going to take up drawing I ought to do it at once. That's what
the drawing-master says, and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought to know.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) finished
on a tone of insolence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't allow you to do it yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``It's quite
out of the question. Quite!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pouted and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) sulked. It was war between them. At times he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) Aunt Sophia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would not leave the subject alone; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would not listen to Constance's reasoning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) openly accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) of
harshness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to get on if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thwarted him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) most earnest desires. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pointed to other boys
whose parents were wiser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very fine of you to put it on father!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) observed
sarcastically.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) drawing entirely.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hinted that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) attended the School of Art she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would be
condemned to solitary evenings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as though saying:
<div class="bookquote">``Well, and if you are--?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) seemed to have no heart.

<p/>After several weeks of intense unhappiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``How many evenings
do you want to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The war was over.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was charming again. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could cling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) again.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``If we can be happy together only when I give
way to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I must give way to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And there was ecstasy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
yielding. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps it's very
important that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should go to the School of Art.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) solaced herself
with such thoughts on three solitary evenings a week, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
to come home.




<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>BRICKS AND MORTAR

<p/>I


<p/>In the summer of that year the occurrence of a white rash of posters on
hoardings and on certain houses and shops, was symptomatic of organic
change in the town. The posters were iterations of a mysterious
announcement and summons, which began with the august words: <div class="bookquote">``By Order
of the Trustees of the late William Clews Mericarp, Esq.''  (<font color='red'><b>The posters</b></font>)</div>Mericarp had
been a considerable owner of property in Bursley. After a prolonged
residence at Southport, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had died, at the age of eighty-two, leaving
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) property behind. For sixty years he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had been a name, not a figure;
and the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) death, which was assuredly an event, incited the
burgesses to gossip, for they had come to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) as one of the
invisible immortals. Constance was shocked, though she (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had never seen
Mericarp. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Everybody dies nowadays!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) thought.-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) owned the
Baines-Povey shop, and also Mr. Critchlow's shop. Constance knew not
how often her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) father and, later, her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) husband, had renewed the lease of
those premises that were now hers; but from her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) earliest recollections
rose a vague memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) father talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mother about
<div class="bookquote">``Mericarp's rent,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>which was and always had been a hundred a year.
Mericarp had earned the reputation of being 'a good landlord.''
Constance said sadly: <div class="bookquote">``We shall never have another as good!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>When a
lawyer's clerk called and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) to permit the exhibition of a
poster in each of her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) shop-windows, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had misgivings for the future;
she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was worried; she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) would determine the lease next
year, so as to be on the safe side; but immediately afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)
decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) could decide nothing.

<p/>The posters continued: <div class="bookquote">``To be sold by auction, at the Tiger Hotel at
six-thirty for seven o'clock precisely.''  (<font color='red'><b>The posters</b></font>)</div>What six-thirty had to do with
seven o'clock precisely no one knew. Then, after stating the name and
credentials of the auctioneer, the posters at length arrived at the
objects to be sold: <div class="bookquote">``All those freehold messuages and shops and
copyhold tenements namely.''  (<font color='red'><b>the posters</b></font>)</div>Houses were never sold by auction in
Bursley. At moments of auction burgesses were reminded that the
erections they lived in were not houses, as they had falsely supposed,
but messuages. Having got as far as `namely' the posters ruled a line
and began afresh: <div class="bookquote">``Lot I. All that extensive and commodious shop and
messuage with the offices and appurtenances thereto belonging situate
and being No. 4 St. Luke's Square in the parish of Bursley in the
County of Stafford and at present in the occupation of Mrs. Constance
Povey widow under a lease expiring in September 1889.''  (<font color='red'><b>the posters</b></font>)</div>Thus clearly
asserting that all Constance's shop was for sale, its whole entirety,
and not a fraction or slice of it merely, the posters proceeded: <div class="bookquote">``Lot
2. All that extensive and commodious shop and messuage with the offices
and appurtenances thereto belonging situate and being No. 3 St. Luke's
Square in the parish of Bursley in the County of Stafford and at
present in the occupation of Charles Critchlow chemist under an
agreement for a yearly tenancy.''  (<font color='red'><b>the posters</b></font>)</div>The catalogue ran to fourteen lots.
The posters, lest any one should foolishly imagine that a non-legal
intellect could have achieved such explicit and comprehensive clarity
of statement, were signed by a powerful firm of solicitors in
Hanbridge. Happily in the Five Towns there were no metaphysicians;
otherwise the firm might have been expected to explain, in the `further
particulars and conditions' which the posters promised, how even a
messuage could `be' the thing at which it was <div class="bookquote">``situate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the posters</b></font>)</div><p/>Within a few hours of the outbreak of the rash, Mr. Critchlow abruptly
presented himself before Constance at the millinery counter; he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
waving a poster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) exclaimed grimly. <div class="bookquote">``What next, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance responded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye thinking o' buying?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) asked. All the assistants, including
Miss Insull, were in hearing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ignored their presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buying!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>repeated Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Not me! I've got quite enough house
property as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>all owners</b></font>)</div><p/>Like all owners of real property, she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) usually adopted towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>)
possessions an attitude implying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) would be willing to pay
somebody to take them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) added, with Mr. Critchlow's own brusqueness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! Buy property in St. Luke's Square!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Critchlow sneered. And
then left the shop as suddenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had entered it.

<p/>The sneer at St. Luke's Square was his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) characteristic expression of an
opinion which had been slowly forming for some years. The Square was no
longer what it had been, though individual businesses might be as good
as ever. For nearly twelve months two shops had been to let in it. And
once, bankruptcy had stained its annals. The tradesmen had naturally
searched for a cause in every direction save the right one, the obvious
one; and naturally they had found a cause. According to the tradesmen,
the cause was `this football.'' The Bursley Football Club had recently
swollen into a genuine rival of the ancient supremacy of the celebrated
Knype Club. It had transformed itself into a limited company, and
rented a ground up the Moorthorne Road, and built a grand stand. The
Bursley F.C. had `tied' with the Knype F.C. on the Knype ground--a
prodigious achievement, an achievement which occupied a column of the
Athletic News one Monday morning! But were the tradesmen civically
proud of this glory? No! They said that `this football' drew people out
of the town on Saturday afternoons, to the complete abolition of
shopping. They said also that people thought of nothing but `this
football;' and, nearly in the same breath, that only roughs and
good-for-nothings could possibly be interested in such a barbarous
game. And they spoke of gate-money, gambling, and professionalism, and
the end of all true sport in England. In brief, something new had come
to the front and was submitting to the ordeal of the curse.

<p/>The sale of the Mericarp estate had a particular interest for
respectable stake-in-the-town persons. It would indicate to what
extent, if at all, `this football' was ruining Bursley. Constance
mentioned to Cyril that she (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) might like to go to the sale,
and as it was dated for one of Cyril's off-nights Cyril said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) might like to go too. So they went together; Samuel used to
attend property sales, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) had never taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) wife to one.
Constance and Cyril arrived at the Tiger shortly after seven o'clock,
and were directed to a room furnished and arranged as for a small
public meeting of philanthropists. A few gentlemen were already
present, but not the instigating trustees, solicitors, and auctioneers.
It appeared that `six-thirty for seven o'clock precisely' meant
seven-fifteen. Constance took a Windsor chair in the corner nearest the
door, and motioned Cyril to the next chair; they dared not speak; they
moved on tiptoe; Cyril inadvertently dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) chair along the floor,
and produced a scrunching sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) blushed, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had
desecrated a church, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother made a gesture of horror. The
remainder of the company glanced at the corner, apparently pained by
this negligence. Some of them greeted Constance, but self-consciously,
with a sort of shamed air; it might have been that they had all
nefariously gathered together there for the committing of a crime.
Fortunately Constance's widowhood had already lost its touching
novelty, so that the greetings, if self-conscious, were at any rate
given without unendurable commiseration and did not cause awkwardness.

<p/>When the official world arrived, fussy, bustling, bearing documents and
a hammer, the general feeling of guilty shame was intensified. Useless
for the auctioneer to try to dissipate the gloom by means of bright
gestures and quick, cheerful remarks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) supporters! Cyril had an
idea that the meeting would open with a hymn, until the apparition of a
tapster with wine showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) error. The auctioneer very
particularly enjoined the tapster to see to it that no one lacked for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) thirst, and the tapster became self-consciously energetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) began
by choosing Constance for service. In refusing wine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) blushed; then
the fellow offered a glass to Cyril, who went scarlet, and mumbled ``No'
with a lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) throat; when the tapster's back was turned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
smiled sheepishly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) mother. The majority of the company accepted
and sipped. The auctioneer sipped and loudly smacked, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Critchlow came in.

<p/>And the auctioneer said again: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! I'm always glad when the tenants
come. That's always a good sign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) glanced round for approval of this sentiment. But everybody seemed
too stiff to move. Even the auctioneer was self-conscious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiter! Offer wine to Mr. Critchlow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) exclaimed bullyingly, as if
saying: <div class="bookquote">``Man! what on earth are you thinking of, to neglect Mr.
Critchlow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>said the waiter, who was dispensing wine as fast
as a waiter can.

<p/>The auction commenced.

<p/>Seizing the hammer, the auctioneer gave a short biography of William
Clews Mericarp, and, this pious duty accomplished, called upon a
solicitor to read the conditions of sale. The solicitor complied and
made a distressing exhibition of self-consciousness. The conditions of
sale were very lengthy, and apparently composed in a foreign tongue;
and the audience listened to this elocution with a stoical pretence of
breathless interest.

<p/>Then the auctioneer put up all that extensive and commodious messuage
and shop situate and being No. 4, St. Luke's Square. Constance and
Cyril moved their limbs surreptitiously, as though being at last found
out. The auctioneer referred to John Baines and to Samuel Povey, with a
sense of personal loss, and then expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) pleasure in the presence
of `the ladies;' he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) meant Constance, who once more had to blush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the auctioneer, <div class="bookquote">``what do you say for these
famous premises? I think I do not exaggerate when I use the word
`famous.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div><p/>Some one said a thousand pounds, in the terrorized voice of a
delinquent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>repeated the auctioneer, paused, sipped, and
smacked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guineas,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another voice self-accused of iniquity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand and fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the auctioneer.

<p/>Then there was a long interval, an interval that tightened the nerves
of the assembly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, ladies and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>the auctioneer adjured.

<p/>The first voice said sulkily: <div class="bookquote">``Eleven hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div><p/>And thus the bids rose to fifteen hundred, lifted bit by bit, as it
were, by the magnetic force of the auctioneer's personality. The man
was now standing up, in domination. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent down to the solicitor's
head; they whispered together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the auctioneer, <div class="bookquote">``I am happy to inform you that the
sale is now open.''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tone translated better than words his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calm
professional beatitude. Suddenly in a voice of wrath he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hissed at the
waiter: <div class="bookquote">``Waiter, why don't you serve these gentlemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The auctioneer</b></font>)</div><p/>The auctioneer sat down and sipped at leisure, chatting with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clerk
and the solicitor and the solicitor's clerk.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose it was as a conqueror. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, fifteen hundred is bid.
Now, Mr. Critchlow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Critchlow shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) head. The auctioneer threw a courteous glance
at Constance, who avoided it.

<p/>After many adjurations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) reluctantly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) hammer, pretended to
let it fall, and saved it several times.

<p/>And then Mr. Critchlow said: <div class="bookquote">``And fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifteen hundred and fifty is bid,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>the auctioneer informed the
company, electrifying the waiter once more. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had sipped he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
said, with feigned sadness: <div class="bookquote">``Come, gentlemen, you surely don't mean to
let this magnificent lot go for fifteen hundred and fifty pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But they did mean that.

<p/>The hammer fell, and the auctioneer's clerk and the solicitor's clerk
took Mr. Critchlow aside and wrote with him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>).

<p/>Nobody was surprised when Mr. Critchlow bought Lot No. 2, his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) own shop.

<p/>Constance whispered then to Cyril that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) wished to leave. They left,
with unnatural precautions, but instantly regained their natural
demeanour in the dark street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never! Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) murmured outside, astonished and
disturbed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) hated the prospect of Mr. Critchlow as a landlord. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)
could not persuade herself to leave the place, in spite of decisions.

<p/>The sale demonstrated that football had not entirely undermined the
commercial basis of society in Bursley; only two Lots had to be
withdrawn.

<p/>II

<p/>On Thursday afternoon of the same week the youth whom Constance had
ended by hiring for the manipulation of shutters and other jobs
unsuitable for fragile women, was closing the shop. The clock had
struck two. All the shutters were up except the last one, in the midst
of the doorway. Miss Insull and her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) mistress were walking about the
darkened interior, putting dust-sheets well over the edges of exposed
goods; the other assistants had just left. The bull-terrier had
wandered into the shop as he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) almost invariably did at closing time--for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) slept there, an efficient guard--and had lain down by the dying
stove; though not venerable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was stiffening into age.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can shut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>said Miss Insull to the youth.

<p/>But as the final shutter was ascending to its position, Mr. Critchlow
appeared on the pavement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold on, young fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Critchlow commanded, and stepped slowly,
lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) long apron, over the horizontal shutter on which the
perpendicular shutters rested in the doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be long, Mr. Critchlow?''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>the youth asked, posing the
shutter. <div class="bookquote">``Or am I to shut?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow, briefly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go out by th' side
door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Mr. Critchlow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Insull</b></font>)</div>Miss Insull called out to Constance, in a
peculiar tone. And a flush, scarcely perceptible, crept very slowly
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) dark features. In the twilight of the shop, lit only by a few
starry holes in the shutters, and by the small side-window, not the
keenest eye could have detected that flush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Critchlow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured the exclamation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) resented his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
future ownership of her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was come to play the
landlord, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) determined to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) see that her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) mood was
independent and free, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) would as lief give up the business as
keep it. In particular she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) meant to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) of having deliberately
deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) intentions on his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) previous visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, missis!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the aged man greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We've made it up between us.
Happen some folk'll think we've taken our time, but I don't know as
that's their affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) little blinking eyes had a red border. The skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pale small
face was wrinkled in millions of minute creases. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) arms and legs were
marvellously thin and sharply angular. The corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) heliotrope
lips were turned down, as usual, in a mysterious comment on the world;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) fronted Constance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) excessive height,
crowned the mystery.

<p/>Constance stared, at a loss. It surely could not after all be true, the
substance of the rumours that had floated like vapours in the Square
for eight years and more!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What...?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>folk</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) head in the direction of Miss Insull.

<p/>The dog had leisurely strolled forward to inspect the edges of the
fiance's trousers. Miss Insull summoned the animal with a noise of
fingers, and then bent down and caressed it. A strange gesture proving
the validity of Charles Critchlow's discovery that in Maria Insull a
human being was buried!

<p/>Miss Insull was, as near as any one could guess, forty years of age.
For twenty-five years she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had served in the shop, passing about twelve
hours a day in the shop; attending regularly at least three religious
services at the Wesleyan Chapel or School on Sundays, and sleeping with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) mother, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) kept. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had never earned more than thirty
shillings a week, and yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) situation was considered to be
exceptionally good. In the eternal fusty dusk of the shop she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had
gradually lost such sexual characteristics and charms as she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had once
possessed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was as thin and flat as Charles Critchlow himself. It
was as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) bosom had suffered from a prolonged drought at a
susceptible period of development, and had never recovered. The one
proof that blood ran in her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) veins was the pimply quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) ruined
complexion, and the pimples of that brickish expanse proved that the
blood was thin and bad. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) hands and feet were large and ungainly; the
skin of the fingers was roughened by coarse contacts to the texture of
emery-paper. On six days a week she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) wore black; on the seventh a kind
of discreet half-mourning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was honest, capable, and industrious;
and beyond the confines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) occupation she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had no curiosity, no
intelligence, no ideas. Superstitions and prejudices, deep and violent,
served her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) for ideas; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) could incomparably sell silks and
bonnets, braces and oilcloth; in widths, lengths, and prices she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) never
erred; she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) never annoyed a customer, nor foolishly promised what could
not be performed, nor was late nor negligent, nor disrespectful. No one
knew anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>), because there was nothing to know. Subtract
the shop-assistant from her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>), and naught remained. Benighted and
spiritually dead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) existed by habit.

<p/>But for Charles Critchlow she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) happened to be an illusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had cast
eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) and had seen youth, innocence, virginity. During eight
years the moth Charles had flitted round the lamp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) brilliance,
and was now singed past escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) with what casualness
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) chose; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might ignore her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) in public; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might talk brutally about
women; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) to wonder dully what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) meant, for months at
a stretch: but there emerged indisputable from the sum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) conduct
the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was
something ornamental and luxurious for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was ready to pay--and
to commit follies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been a widower since before she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was born; to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was a slip of a girl. All is relative in this world. As for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was too indifferent to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Why refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)? Oysters do
not refuse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I congratulate you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance breathed, realizing the
import of Mr. Critchlow's laconic words. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope you'll be
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria Insull</b></font>)</div>said Maria Insull.

<p/>Nobody seemed to know what to say next. <div class="bookquote">``It's rather sudden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>was on
Constance's tongue, but did not achieve utterance, being patently
absurd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Critchlow, as though himself contemplating anew the
situation.

<p/>Miss Insull gave the dog a final pat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow. <div class="bookquote">``Now, missis, ye want to give
up this shop, don't ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so sure about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance answered uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) protested. <div class="bookquote">``Of course ye want to give up the shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've lived here all my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye've not lived in th' shop all ye're life. I said th' shop. Listen
here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``I've got a proposal to make to you. You can keep
on the house, and I'll take the shop off ye're hands. Now?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) inquiringly.

<p/>Constance was taken aback by the brusqueness of the suggestion, which,
moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) did not understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow, impatiently, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) moved towards the
house-door of the shop, behind the till.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come where? What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance demanded in a maze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow, with increasing impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Follow me,
will ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance obeyed. Miss Insull sidled after Constance, and the dog after
Miss Insull. Mr. Critchlow went through the doorway and down the
corridor, past the cutting-out room to his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) right. The corridor then
turned at a right-angle to the left and ended at the parlour door, the
kitchen steps being to the left.

<p/>Mr. Critchlow stopped short of the kitchen steps, and extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
arms, touching the walls on either side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) said, tapping the walls with his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) bony knuckles. <div class="bookquote">``Here!
Suppose I brick ye this up, and th' same upstairs between th' showroom
and th' bedroom passage, ye've got your house to yourself. Ye say ye've
lived here all your life. Well, what's to prevent ye finishing up here?
The fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``it would only be making into two houses again
what was two houses to start with, afore your time, missis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about the shop?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye can sell us th' stock at a valuation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance suddenly comprehended the scheme. Mr. Critchlow would remain
the chemist, while Mrs. Critchlow became the head of the chief drapery
business in the town. Doubtless they would knock a hole through the
separating wall on the other side, to balance the bricking-up on this
side. They must have thought it all out in detail. Constance revolted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) said, a little disdainfully. <div class="bookquote">``And my goodwill? Shall you
take that at a valuation too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Critchlow glanced at the creature for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was ready to scatter
thousands of pounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) might have been a Phryne and he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) the infatuated
fool. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) as if to say: <div class="bookquote">``We expected this, and this is
where we agreed it was to stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) said to Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Show me your goodwill. Lap it up in a bit
of paper and hand it over, and I'll take it at a valuation. But not
afore, missis! Not afore! I'm making ye a very good offer. Twenty pound
a year, I'll let ye th' house for. And take th' stock at a valuation.
Think it over, my lass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Having said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had to say, Charles Critchlow departed, according
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) custom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) unceremoniously let himself out by the side door, and
passed with wavy apron round the corner of King Street into the Square
and so to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) own shop, which ignored the Thursday half-holiday. Miss
Insull left soon afterwards.

<p/>III

<p/>Constance's pride urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) to refuse the offer. But in truth her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) sole
objection to it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) had not thought of the scheme herself. For
the scheme really reconciled her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) wish to remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>)
wish to be free of the shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) put me in a new window in the parlour--one that will
open!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) said positively to Cyril, who accepted Mr. Critchlow's idea
with fatalistic indifference.

<p/>After stipulating for the new window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) closed with the offer. Then
there was the stock-taking, which endured for weeks. And then a
carpenter came and measured for the window. And a builder and a mason
came and inspected doorways, and Constance felt that the end was upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) took up the carpet in the parlour and protected the furniture
by dustsheets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) and Cyril lived between bare boards and dustsheets
for twenty days, and neither carpenter nor mason reappeared. Then one
surprising day the old window was removed by the carpenter's two
journeymen, and late in the afternoon the carpenter brought the new
window, and the three men worked till ten o'clock at night, fixing it.
Cyril wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) cap and went to bed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) cap, and Constance wore a
Paisley shawl. A painter had bound himself beyond all possibility of
failure to paint the window on the morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was to begin at six a.m.;
and Amy's alarm-clock was altered so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might be up and dressed
to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) came a week later, administered one coat, and vanished
for another ten days. Then two masons suddenly came with heavy tools,
and were shocked to find that all was not prepared for them. -LRB-After
three carpetless weeks Constance had relaid her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) floors.-RRB- They tore off
wall-paper, sent cascades of plaster down the kitchen steps, withdrew
alternate courses of bricks from the walls, and, sated with
destruction, hastened away. After four days new red bricks began to
arrive, carried by a quite guiltless hodman who had not visited the
house before. The hodman met the full storm of Constance's wrath. It
was not a vicious wrath, rather a good-humoured wrath; but it impressed
the hodman. <div class="bookquote">``My house hasn't been fit to live in for a month,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said
in fine. <div class="bookquote">``If these walls aren't built to-morrow, upstairs AND
down--to-morrow, mind!--don't let any of you dare to show your noses
here again, for I won't have you. Now you've brought your bricks. Off
with you, and tell your master what I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was effective. The next day subdued and plausible workmen of all
sorts awoke the house with knocking at six-thirty precisely, and the
two doorways were slowly bricked up. The curious thing was that, when
the barrier was already a foot high on the ground-floor Constance
remembered small possessions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had omitted to remove
from the cutting-out room. Picking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) skirts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stepped over into
the region that was no more hers, and stepped back with the goods. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
had a bandanna round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head to keep the thick dust out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was very busy, very preoccupied with nothings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had no time for
sentimentalities. Yet when the men arrived at the topmost course and
were at last hidden behind their own erection, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could see only
rough bricks and mortar, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was disconcertingly overtaken by a misty
blindness and could not even see bricks and mortar. Cyril found her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) absurd bandanna, weeping in a sheet-covered rocking-chair in
the sacked parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) whistled uneasily, remarked: <div class="bookquote">``I say, mother,
what about tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then, hearing the heavy voices of workmen above,
ran with relief upstairs. Tea had been set in the drawing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was
glad to learn that from Amy, who informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) also that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should
`never get used to them there new walls,'' not as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lived.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) went to the School of Art that night. Constance, alone, could find
nothing to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had willed that the walls should be built, and they
had been built; but days must elapse before they could be plastered,
and after the plaster still more days before the papering. Not for
another month, perhaps, would her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) house be free of workmen and ripe for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own labours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could only sit in the dust-drifts and contemplate
the havoc of change, and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes as dry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could. The legal
transactions were all but complete; little bills announcing the
transfer of the business lay on the counters in the shop at the
disposal of customers. In two days Charles Critchlow would pay the
price of a desire realized. The sign was painted out and new letters
sketched thereon in chalk. In future she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would be compelled, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
wished to enter the shop, to enter it as a customer and from the front.
Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw that, though the house remained hers, the root of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) life
had been wrenched up.

<p/>And the mess! It seemed inconceivable that the material mess could ever
be straightened away!

<p/>Yet, ere the fields of the county were first covered with snow that
season, only one sign survived of the devastating revolution, and that
was a loose sheet of wall-paper that had been too soon pasted on to new
plaster and would not stick. Maria Insull was Maria Critchlow.
Constance had been out into the Square and seen the altered sign, and
seen Mrs. Critchlow's taste in window-curtains, and seen--most
impressive sight of all--that the grimy window of the abandoned room at
the top of the abandoned staircase next to the bedroom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) girlhood,
had been cleaned and a table put in front of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) knew that the
chamber, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) herself had never entered, was to be employed as a
storeroom, but the visible proof of its conversion so strangely
affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had not felt able to go boldly into the shop, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had meant to do, and make a few purchases in the way of
friendliness. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a silly woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) muttered. Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) did
venture, timidly abrupt, into the shop, and was received with fitting
state by Mrs. Critchlow -LRB-as desiccated as ever-RRB-, who insisted on
allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) the special trade discount. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) little
friendly purchases round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) own door in King Street. Trivial,
trivial event! Constance, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, did
both. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) accused herself of developing a hysterical faculty in tears,
and strove sagely against it.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>THE PROUDEST MOTHER

<p/>I


<p/>In the year 1893 there was a new and strange man living at No. 4, St.
Luke's Square. Many people remarked on the phenomenon. Very few of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
like had ever been seen in Bursley before. One of the striking things
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was the complex way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) secured himself by means of
glittering chains. A chain stretched across his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) waistcoat, passing
through a special button-hole, without a button, in the middle. To this
cable were firmly linked a watch at one end and a pencil-case at the
other; the chain also served as a protection against a thief who might
attempt to snatch the fancy waistcoat entire. Then there were longer
chains, beneath the waistcoat, partly designed, no doubt, to deflect
bullets, but serving mainly to enable the owner to haul up penknives,
cigarette-cases, match-boxes, and key-rings from the profundities of
hip-pockets. An essential portion of the man's braces, visible
sometimes when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) played at tennis, consisted of chain, and the upper
and nether halves of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cuff-links were connected by chains.
Occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to be seen chained to a dog.

<p/>A reversion, conceivably, to a mediaeval type! Yes, but also the
exemplar of the excessively modern! Externally he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a consequence of
the fact that, years previously, the leading tailor in Bursley had
permitted his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) son to be apprenticed in London. The father died; the son
had the wit to return and make a fortune while creating a new type in
the town, a type of which multiple chains were but one feature, and
that the least expensive if the most salient. For instance, up to the
historic year in which the young tailor created the type, any cap was a
cap in Bursley, and any collar was a collar. But thenceforward no cap
was a cap, and no collar was a collar, which did not exactly conform in
shape and material to certain sacred caps and collars guarded by the
young tailor in his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) back shop. None knew why these sacred caps and
collars were sacred, but they were; their sacredness endured for about
six months, and then suddenly--again none knew why--they fell from
their estate and became lower than offal for dogs, and were supplanted
on the altar. The type brought into existence by the young tailor was
to be recognized by its caps and collars, and in a similar manner by
every other article of attire, except its boots. Unfortunately the
tailor did not sell boots, and so imposed on his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) creatures no mystical
creed as to boots. This was a pity, for the boot-makers of the town
happened not to be inflamed by the type-creating passion as the tailor
was, and thus the new type finished abruptly at the edges of the
tailor's trousers.

<p/>The man at No. 4, St. Luke's Square had comparatively small and narrow
feet, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) an advantage; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was endowed with a certain
vague general physical distinction he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) managed, despite the eternal
untidiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) hair, to be eminent among the type. Assuredly the
frequent sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) house flattered the pride of Constance's
eye, which rested on him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) almost always with pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had come into
the house with startling abruptness soon after Cyril left school and
was indentured to the head-designer at <div class="bookquote">``Peel's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>that classic
earthenware manufactory. The presence of a man in her (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) abode
disconcerted Constance at the beginning; but she (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) soon grew accustomed
to it, perceiving that a man would behave as a man, and must be
expected to do so. This man, in truth, did what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked in all things.
Cyril having always been regarded by both his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) parents as enormous, one
would have anticipated a giant in the new man; but, queerly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
slim, and little above the average height. Neither in enormity nor in
many other particulars did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resemble the Cyril whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
supplanted. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gestures were lighter and quicker; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nothing of
Cyril's ungainliness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had not Cyril's limitless taste for sweets,
nor Cyril's terrific hatred of gloves, barbers, and soap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was much
more dreamy than Cyril, and much busier. In fact, Constance only saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) at meal-times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was at Peel's in the day and at the School of Art
every night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would dream during a meal, even; and, without actually
saying so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) gave the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was the busiest man in
Bursley, wrapped in occupations and preoccupations as in a blanket--a
blanket which Constance had difficulty in penetrating.

<p/>Constance wanted to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) lived for nothing but to please
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was, however, exceedingly difficult to please, not in the least
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was hypercritical and exacting, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
indifferent. Constance, in order to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) desire of pleasing, had
to make fifty efforts, in the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) might chance to notice one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was a good man, amazingly industrious--when once Constance had got
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) out of bed in the morning; with no vices; kind, save when Constance
mistakenly tried to thwart him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>); charming, with a curious strain of
humour that Constance only half understood. Constance was
unquestionably vain about him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could honestly find in him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
little to blame. But whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) universe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was
merely a dim figure in the background of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). Every now and then, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) gentle, elegant raillery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would apparently rediscover her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), as
though saying: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! You're still there, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Constance could not
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) on the plane where his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) interests lay, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) never knew the
passionate intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) absorption in that minor part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) life
which moved on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) plane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) never worried about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) solitude, or
guessed that in throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) a smile and a word at supper he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was paying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) meagrely for three hours of lone rocking in a rocking-chair.

<p/>The worst of it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was quite incurable. No experience would
suffice to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) trick of continually expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to notice things
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) never did notice. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, in the midst of a silence:
<div class="bookquote">``By the way, didn't father leave any boxes of cigars?''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had the
steps up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) bedroom and reached down from the dusty top of the
wardrobe the box which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had put there after Samuel's funeral. In
handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) the box she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was doing a great deed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) age was nineteen
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was ratifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) precocious habit of smoking by this solemn
gift. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) entirely ignored the box for several days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said timidly:
<div class="bookquote">``Have you tried those cigars?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'll try 'em one
of these days.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ten days later, on a Sunday when he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) chanced not to have
gone out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) aristocratic friend Matthew Peel-Swynnerton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) did
at length open the box and take out a cigar. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) observed
roguishly, cutting the cigar, <div class="bookquote">``we shall see, Mrs. Plover!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) often
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) Mrs. Plover, for fun. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) to be
sufficiently interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) did not like being
called Mrs. Plover, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) never failed to say: <div class="bookquote">``I'm not Mrs. Plover.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) smoked the cigar slowly, in the rocking-chair, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) head
back and sending clouds to the ceiling. And afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) remarked:
<div class="bookquote">``The old man's cigars weren't so bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) answered tartly,
as if maternally resenting this easy patronage. But in secret she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was
delighted. There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) son's favourable verdict on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
husband's cigars that thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Impossible to see in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) any resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
father! Oh! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a far more brilliant, more advanced, more
complicated, more seductive being than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) homely father! She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) wondered
where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come from. And yet...! If his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father had lived, what would
have occurred between them? Would the boy have been openly smoking
cigars in the house at nineteen?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) laboriously interested herself, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would allow, in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
artistic studies and productions. A back attic on the second floor was
now transformed into a studio--a naked apartment which smelt of oil and
of damp clay. Often there were traces of clay on the stairs. For
working in clay he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) demanded of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother a smock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made a
smock, on the model of a genuine smock which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) obtained from a
country-woman who sold eggs and butter in the Covered Market. Into the
shoulders of the smock she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put a week's fancy-stitching, taking the
pattern from an old book of embroidery. One day when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
stitching morn, noon, and afternoon, at the smock, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
rocked idly after supper: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you haven't forgotten all about
the smock I asked you for, have you, mater?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
teasing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); but, while perfectly realizing how foolish she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
nearly always acted as though his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teasing was serious; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) picked up
the smock again from the sofa. When the smock was finished he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) examined
it intently; then exclaimed with an air of surprise: <div class="bookquote">``By Jove! That's
beautiful! Where did you get this pattern?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) continued to stare at
it, smiling in pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned over the tattered leaves of the
embroidery-book with the same naive, charmed astonishment, and carried
the book away to the studio. <div class="bookquote">``I must show that to Swynnerton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
As for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), the epithet `beautiful' seemed a strange epithet to apply
to a mere piece of honest stitchery done in a pattern, and a stitch
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been familiar all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life. The fact was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
understood his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) `art' less and less. The sole wall decoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
studio was a Japanese print, which struck her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as being entirely
preposterous, considered as a picture. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) much preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own early
drawings of moss-roses and picturesque castles--things that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) now
mercilessly contemned. Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cutting out another
smock. <div class="bookquote">``What's that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you can't
manage with one smock. What shall you do when that one has to go to the
wash?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wash!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) repeated vaguely. <div class="bookquote">``There's no need for it to go to
the wash.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``don't try my patience! I was thinking
of making you half-a-dozen.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whistled. <div class="bookquote">``With all that stitching?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
questioned, amazed at the undertaking. <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. In her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
young days, no seamstress ever made fewer than half-a-dozen of
anything, and it was usually a dozen; it was sometimes half-a-dozen
dozen. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``you have got a nerve! I'll say that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Similar things happened whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was pleased. If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
said of a dish, in the local tongue: <div class="bookquote">``I could do a bit of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or if
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) simply smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lips over it, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would surfeit him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with that
dish.

<p/>II

<p/>On a hot day in August, just before they were to leave Bursley for a
month in the Isle of Man, Cyril came home, pale and perspiring, and
dropped on to the sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) wore a grey alpaca suit, and, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
hair, which in addition to being very untidy was damp with sweat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
was a masterpiece of slim elegance, despite the heat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) blew out great
sighs, and rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) head on the antimacassared arm of the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mater,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said, in a voice of factitious calm, <div class="bookquote">``I've got it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was looking up at the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The National Scholarship. Swynnerton says it's a sheer fluke. But I've
got it. Great glory for the Bursley School of Art!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``National Scholarship?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What's that? What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) admonished her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), not without testiness. <div class="bookquote">``Don't go and
say I've never breathed a word about it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) lit a cigarette, to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) self-consciousness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) perceived
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was moved far beyond the ordinary.

<p/>Never, in fact, not even by the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) husband, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) received
such a frightful blow as that which the dreamy Cyril had just dealt her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/>It was not a complete surprise, but it was nearly a complete surprise.
A few months previously he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) certainly had mentioned, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) incidental
way, the subject of a National Scholarship. Apropos of a drinking-cup
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had designed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had said that the director of the School of
Art had suggested that it was good enough to compete for the National,
and that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was otherwise qualified for the competition he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) might as
well send the cup to South Kensington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had added that
Peel-Swynnerton had laughed at the notion as absurd. On that occasion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had comprehended that a National Scholarship involved residence in
London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) ought to have begun to live in fear, for Cyril had a most
disturbing habit of making a mere momentary reference to matters which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) deemed very important and which occupied a large share of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was secretive by nature, and the rigidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father's
rule had developed this trait in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) character. But really he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had
spoken of the competition with such an extreme casualness that with
little effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had dismissed it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) anxieties as involving a
contingency so remote as to be negligible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had, genuinely, almost
forgotten it. Only at rare intervals had it wakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) a dull
transitory pain--like the herald of a fatal malady. And, as a woman in
the opening stage of disease, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had hastily reassured herself: <div class="bookquote">``How
silly of me! This can't possibly be anything serious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was condemned. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew there could be no
appeal. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might as usefully have besought mercy from a
tiger as from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good, industrious, dreamy son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means a pound a week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) self-consciousness
intensified by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) silence and by the dreadful look on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``And
of course free tuition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For how long?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) managed to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that depends. Nominally for a year. But if you behave
yourself it's always continued for three years.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) stayed for three
years he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would never come back: that was a certainty.

<p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rebelled, furious and despairing, against the fortuitous
cruelty of things! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had not, till then, thought
seriously of going to London. But the fact that the Government would
admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) free to its classrooms and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) a pound a week besides,
somehow forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to go to London. It was not the lack of means that
would have prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) from going. Why, then, should the presence of
means induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to go? There was no logical reason. The whole affair
was disastrously absurd. The art-master at the Wedgwood Institution had
chanced, merely chanced, to suggest that the drinking-cup should be
sent to South Kensington. And the result of this caprice was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
was sentenced to solitude for life! It was too monstrously, too
incredibly wicked!

<p/>With what futile and bitter execration she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) murmured in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) heart the
word <div class="bookquote">``If.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If Cyril's childish predilections had not been encouraged!
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had only been content to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father's trade! If she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had
flatly refused to sign his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) indenture at Peel's and pay the premium! If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had not turned from, colour to clay! If the art-master had not had
that fatal `idea'! If the judges for the competition had decided
otherwise! If only she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had brought Cyril up in habits of obedience,
sacrificing temporary peace to permanent security!

<p/>For after all he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could not abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) without her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was not
of age. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would want a lot more money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could obtain from
none but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could refuse...

<p/>No! She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could not refuse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was the master, the tyrant. For the sake
of daily pleasantness she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had weakly yielded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) at the start! She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
had behaved badly to herself and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was spoiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had
spoiled him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was about to repay her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) with lifelong misery, and
nothing would deflect him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) course. The usual conduct of the
spoilt child! Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) not witnessed it, and moralized upon it, in other
families?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem very chirpy over it, mater!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) went out of the room. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) joy in the prospect of departure from the
Five Towns, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) masked it, was more manifest than she (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
could bear.

<p/>The Signal, the next day, made a special item of the news. It appeared
that no National Scholarship had been won in the Five Towns for eleven
years. The citizens were exhorted to remember that Mr. Povey had gained
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) success in open competition with the cleverest young students of
the entire kingdom--and in a branch of art which he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had but recently
taken up; and further, that the Government offered only eight
scholarships each year. The name of Cyril Povey passed from lip to lip.
And nobody who met Constance, in street or shop, could refrain from
informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) ought to be a proud mother, to have such a son,
but that truly they were not surprised ... and how proud his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) poor
father would have been! A few sympathetically hinted that maternal
pride was one of those luxuries that may cost too dear.

<p/>III

<p/>The holiday in the Isle of Man was of course ruined for her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) could
scarcely walk because of the weight of a lump of lead that she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) carried
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) bosom. On the brightest days the lump of lead was always there.
Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was so obese. In ordinary circumstances they might have
stayed beyond the month. An indentured pupil is not strapped to the
wheel like a common apprentice. Moreover, the indentures were to be
cancelled. But Constance did not care to stay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had to prepare for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) departure to London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had to lay the faggots for her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own
martyrdom.

<p/>In this business of preparation she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) showed as much silliness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
betrayed as perfect a lack of perspective, as the most superior son
could desire for a topic of affectionate irony. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) preoccupation with
petty things of no importance whatever was worthy of the finest
traditions of fond motherhood. However, Cyril's careless satire had no
effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), save that once she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) got angry, thereby startling him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
quite correctly and sagely laid this unprecedented outburst to the
account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) wrought nerves, and forgave it. Happily for the
smoothness of Cyril's translation to London, young Peel-Swynnerton was
acquainted with the capital, had a brother in Chelsea, knew of
reputable lodgings, was, indeed, an encyclopaedia of the town, and
would himself spend a portion of the autumn there. Otherwise, the
preliminaries which his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) mother would have insisted on by means of tears
and hysteria might have proved fatiguing to Cyril.

<p/>The day came when on that day week Cyril would be gone. Constance
steadily fabricated cheerfulness against the prospect. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I come with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) smiled in toleration of this joke as being a passable quality of
joke. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled in the same sense, hastening to agree with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) that as a joke it was not a bad joke.

<p/>In the last week he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was very loyal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) tailor. Many a young man
would have commanded new clothes after, not before, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival in
London. But Cyril had faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) creator.

<p/>On the day of departure the household, the very house itself, was in a
state of excitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was to leave early. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would not listen to the
project of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) as far as Knype, where the Loop Line
joined the main. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might go to Bursley Station and no further. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rebelled he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) disclosed the merest hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) sullen-churlish side,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at once yielded. During breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not cry, but the
aspect of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face made him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) protest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, look here, mater! Just try to remember that I shall be back for
Christmas. It's barely three months.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) lit a cigarette.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made no reply.

<p/>Amy lugged a Gladstone bag down the crooked stairs. A trunk was already
close to the door; it had wrinkled the carpet and deranged the mat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't forget to put the hair-brush in, did you, Amy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``N--no, Mr. Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) blubbered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance sharply corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), as Cyril ran upstairs, <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder you can't control yourself better than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy weakly apologized. Although treated almost as one of the family,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ought not to have forgotten that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was a servant. What right had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to weep over Cyril's luggage? This question was put to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in
Constance's tone.

<p/>The cab came. Cyril tumbled downstairs with exaggerated carelessness,
and with exaggerated carelessness he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) joked at the cabman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) cried, when the luggage was stowed. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want me
to miss this train?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) knew that the margin of time was ample. It
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) fun!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I can't be hurried!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bonnet. <div class="bookquote">``Amy, as soon
as we are gone you can clear this table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) climbed heavily into the cab.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it! Smash the springs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril teased her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>The horse got a stinging cut to recall him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to the seriousness of life.
It was a fine, bracing autumn morning, and the driver felt the need of
communicating his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) abundant energy to some one or something. They drove
off, Amy staring after them from the door. Matters had been so
marvellously well arranged that they arrived at the station twenty
minutes before the train was due.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril mockingly comforted his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``You'd rather be
twenty minutes too soon than one minute too late, wouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) high spirits had to come out somehow.

<p/>Gradually the minutes passed, and the empty slate-tinted platform
became dotted with people to whom that train was nothing but a Loop
Line train, people who took that train every week-day of their lives
and knew all its eccentricities.

<p/>And they heard the train whistle as it started from Turnhill. And Cyril
had a final word with the porter who was in charge of the luggage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
made a handsome figure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had twenty pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) pocket. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
returned to Constance she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sniffing, and through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) veil he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) could
see that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes were circled with red. But through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) veil she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
see nothing. The train rolled in, rattling to a standstill. Constance
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) veil and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>); and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) smelt the
odour of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) crape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was, for an instant, close to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), close; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
seemed to have an overwhelmingly intimate glimpse into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) secrets; he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
seemed to be choked in the sudden strong emotion of that crape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) felt
queer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are, sir! Second smoker!''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>called the porter.

<p/>The daily frequenters of the train boarded it with their customary
disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll write as soon as ever I get there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) own
accord. It was the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could muster.

<p/>With what grace he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hat!

<p/>A sliding-away; clouds of steam; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shared the dead platform with
milk-cans, two porters, and Smith's noisy boy!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walked home, very slowly and painfully. The lump of lead was
heavier than ever before. And the townspeople saw the proudest mother
in Bursley walking home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) argued with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul angrily, petulantly, <div class="bookquote">``could you
expect the boy to do anything else? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a serious student, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has had
a brilliant success, and is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to be tied to your apron-strings? The
idea is preposterous. It isn't as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was an idler, or a bad son. No
mother could have a better son. A nice thing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should stay all
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life in Bursley simply because you don't like being left alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Unfortunately one might as well argue with a mule as with one's soul.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul only kept on saying monotonously: <div class="bookquote">``I'm a lonely old woman now.
I've nothing to live for any more, and I'm no use to anybody. Once I
was young and proud. And this is what my life has come to! This is the
end!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reached home, Amy had not touched the breakfast things; the
carpet was still wrinkled, and the mat still out of place. And, through
the desolating atmosphere of reaction after a terrific crisis, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
marched directly upstairs, entered his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) plundered room, and beheld the
disorder of the bed in which he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had slept.




<p/>BOOK III

<p/>SOPHIA




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>THE ELOPEMENT

<p/>I


<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) soberly rich dress had a countrified air, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) waited, ready for
the streets, in the bedroom of the London hotel on the afternoon of the
first of July, 1866; but there was nothing of the provincial in that
beautiful face, nor in that bearing at once shy and haughty; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
eager heart soared beyond geographical boundaries.

<p/>It was the Hatfield Hotel, in Salisbury Street, between the Strand and
the river. Both street and hotel are now gone, lost in the vast
foundations of the Savoy and the Cecil; but the type of the Hatfield
lingers with ever-increasing shabbiness in Jermyn Street. In 1866, with
its dark passages and crooked stairs, its candles, its carpets and
stuffs which had outlived their patterns, its narrow dining-room where
a thousand busy flies ate together at one long table, its acrid
stagnant atmosphere, and its disturbing sensation of dirt everywhere
concealing itself, it stood forth in rectitude as a good average modern
hotel. The patched and senile drabness of the bedroom made an
environment that emphasized Sophia's flashing youth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) alone in it
was unsullied.

<p/>There was a knock at the door, apparently gay and jaunty. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thought, truly: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s nearly as nervous as I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sick
nervousness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) coughed, and then tried to take full possession of
herself. The moment had at last come which would divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life as a
battle divides the history of a nation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind in an instant swept
backwards through an incredible three months.

<p/>The schemings to obtain and to hide Gerald's letters at the shop, and
to reply to them! The far more complex and dangerous duplicity
practised upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) majestic aunt at Axe! The visits to the Axe
post-office! The three divine meetings with Gerald at early morning by
the canal-feeder, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) inheritance and of the
harshness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) uncle Boldero, and with a rush of words had spread
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the prospect of eternal bliss! The nights of fear! The
sudden, dizzy acquiescence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) plan, and the feeling of universal
unreality which obsessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! The audacious departure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) aunt's,
showering a cascade of appalling lies! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dismay at Knype Station! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
blush as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked for a ticket to London! The ironic, sympathetic
glance of the porter, who took charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) trunk! And then the
thunder of the incoming train! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) renewed dismay when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found that
it was very full, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) distracted plunge into a compartment with six
people already in it! And the abrupt reopening of the carriage-door and
that curt inquisition from an inspector: <div class="bookquote">``Where for, please? Where for?
Where for?''  (<font color='red'><b>an inspector</b></font>)</div>Until her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turn was reached: <div class="bookquote">``Where for, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) weak
little reply: <div class="bookquote">``Euston'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>! And more violent blushes! And then the long,
steady beating of the train over the rails, keeping time to the rhythm
of the unanswerable voice within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) breast: <div class="bookquote">``Why are you here? Why are
you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then Rugby; and the awful ordeal of meeting Gerald, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
entry into the compartment, the rearrangement of seats, and their
excruciatingly painful attempts at commonplace conversation in the
publicity of the carriage! -LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had felt that that part of the
enterprise had not been very well devised by Gerald.-RRB- And at last
London; the thousands of cabs, the fabulous streets, the general roar,
all dream-surpassing, intensifying to an extraordinary degree the
obsession of unreality, the illusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not really have
done what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had done, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not really doing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
doing!

<p/>Supremely and finally, the delicious torture of the clutch of terror at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) moved by Gerald's side through the impossible
adventure! Who was this rash, mad Sophia? Surely not herself!

<p/>The knock at the door was impatiently repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said timidly.

<p/>Gerald Scales came in. Yes, beneath that mien of a commercial traveller
who has been everywhere and through everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was very nervous. It
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) privacy that, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) consent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had invaded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had engaged
the bedroom only with the intention of using it as a retreat for Sophia
until the evening, when they were to resume their travels. It ought not
to have had any disturbing significance. But the mere disorder on the
washstand, a towel lying on one of the cane chairs, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) feel that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was affronting decency, and so increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) jaunty nervousness. The
moment was painful; the moment was difficult beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) skill to handle
it naturally.

<p/>Approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with factitious ease, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) veil,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) then lifted with an impulsive movement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
again, more ardently, perceiving that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ardour was exceeding his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).
This was the first time they had been alone together since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flight
from Axe. And yet, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) worldly experience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was naive enough to
be surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not put all the heat of passion into his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
embrace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was not thrilled at the contact with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! However, the powerful clinging of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips somewhat startled his (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
senses, and also delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) by its silent promise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could smell
the stuff of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) veil, the sarsenet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bodice, and, as it were
wrapped in these odours as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body was wrapped in its clothes, the
faint fleshly perfume of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body itself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face, viewed so close
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could see the almost imperceptible down on those fruit-like
cheeks, was astonishingly beautiful; the dark eyes were exquisitely
misted; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could feel the secret loyalty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soul ascending to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was very slightly taller than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lover; but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hung
from him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body curved backwards, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bosom pressed against his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>),
so that instead of looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) looked down at it. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
preferred that; perfectly proportioned though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) stature was a
delicate point with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) spirits rose by the uplift of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) senses.
His (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fears slipped away; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) began to be very satisfied with himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
was the inheritor of twelve thousand pounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had won this unique
creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) capture; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) close, permittedly scanning
the minutiae of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) skin, permittedly crushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flimsy silks.
Something in him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) modesty on the altar of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
desire. And the sun brightly shone. So he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) yet more ardently,
and with the slightest touch of a victor's condescension; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
burning response more than restored the self-confidence which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
been losing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got no one but you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured in a melting voice.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fancied in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ignorance that the expression of this sentiment
would please him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not aware that a man is usually rather
chilled by it, because it proves to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the other is thinking
about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) responsibilities and not about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) privileges. Certainly it
calmed Gerald, though without imparting to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
responsibilities. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled vaguely. To Sophia his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile was a miracle
continually renewed; it mingled dashing gaiety with a hint of wistful
appeal in a manner that never failed to bewitch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). A less innocent
girl than Sophia might have divined from that adorable half-feminine
smile that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could do anything with Gerald except rely on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). But
Sophia had to learn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) asked, placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shoulders and
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, nerving herself. Their faces were still very near
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, would you like to go and see the Dore pictures?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A simple enough question! A proposal felicitous enough! Dore was
becoming known even in the Five Towns, not, assuredly, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dore</b></font>)
illustrations to the Contes Drolatiques of Balzac--but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dore</b></font>)
shuddering Biblical conceits. In pious circles Dore was saving art from
the reproach of futility and frivolity. It was indubitably a tasteful
idea on Gerald's part to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) love of a summer's afternoon to gaze
at the originals of those prints which had so deeply impressed the Five
Towns. It was an idea that sanctified the profane adventure.

<p/>Yet Sophia showed signs of affliction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) colour went and came; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
throat made the motion of swallowing; there was a muscular contraction
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) whole body. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) drew herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glance,
however, did not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) eyes fell before hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what about the--wedding?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) breathed.

<p/>That sentence seemed to cost all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pride; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was obliged to
utter it, and to pay for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said lightly and quickly, just as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
of a detail that might have been forgotten, <div class="bookquote">``I was just going to tell
you. It can't be done here. There's been some change in the rules. I
only found out for certain late last night. But I've ascertained that
it'll be as simple as ABC before the English Consul at Paris; and as
I've got the tickets for us to go over to-night, as we arranged ...''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
stopped.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat down on the towel-covered chair, staggered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) believed what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not suspect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was using the classic device of
the seducer. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) casualness that staggered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Had it really
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) intention to set off on an excursion and remark as an
afterthought: <div class="bookquote">``BY THE WAY, we can't be married as I told you at
half-past two to-day'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) extreme ignorance and innocence,
Sophia held a high opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own commonsense and capacity for
looking after herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could scarcely believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was
expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to go to Paris, and at night, without being married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
looked pitiably young, virgin, raw, unsophisticated; helpless in the
midst of dreadful dangers. Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head was full of a blank
astonishment at being mistaken for a simpleton! The sole explanation
could be that Gerald, in some matters, must himself be a confiding
simpleton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had not reflected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had not sufficiently realized the
immensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sacrifice in flying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) even to London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt
sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had the woman's first glimpse of the necessity for
some adjustment of outlook as an essential preliminary to uninterrupted
happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald persuasively continued.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was nineteen. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) utterly mature and mysterious. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face baffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>);
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind was a foreign land. Helpless in one sense she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might be; yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and not he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), stood for destiny; the future lay in the secret and
capricious workings of that mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed curtly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't possibly go like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't I tell you it'll be all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) protested. <div class="bookquote">``If we stay
here and they come after you...! Besides, I've got the tickets and all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell me sooner?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how could I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``Have we had a single minute alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was nearly true. They could not have discussed the formalities of
marriage in the crowded train, nor during the hurried lunch with a
dozen cocked ears at the same table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) saw himself on sure ground here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, could we?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you talk about going to see pictures!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reply.

<p/>Undoubtedly this had been a grave error of tact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) recognized that it
was a stupidity. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) resented it, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had committed it
and not he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said, hurt, <div class="bookquote">``I acted for the best. It isn't my fault
if rules are altered and officials silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have told me before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) persisted sullenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how could I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) almost believed in that moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had really intended to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and that the ineptitudes of red-tape had prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) from
achieving his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) honourable purpose. Whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had done nothing whatever
towards the marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) repeated, with heavy lip and liquid eye. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) gathered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was flouting his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) suggestion of Paris.

<p/>Slowly and nervously he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not stir nor look up.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glance was fixed on the washstand. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) bent down and murmured:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now. It'll be all right. You'll travel in the ladies' saloon on
the steam-packet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not stir. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) bent lower and touched the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) neck with
his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) lips. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sprang up, sobbing and angry. Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was mad for
him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) furiously. All tenderness had vanished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll thank you not to touch me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said fiercely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips a moment ago, but now to graze her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) neck was an insult.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) smiled sheepishly. <div class="bookquote">``But really you must be reasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) argued.
<div class="bookquote">``What have I done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what you haven't done, I think!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell
me while we were in the cab?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't care to begin worrying you just then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) replied: which was
exactly true.

<p/>The fact was, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had of course shirked telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that no marriage
would occur that day. Not being a professional seducer of young girls,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) lacked skill to do a difficult thing simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now come along, little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) went on, with just a trifle of
impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Let's go out and enjoy ourselves. I assure you that
everything will be all right in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what you said about coming to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) retorted
sarcastically through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sobs. <div class="bookquote">``And look at you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) imagine for a single instant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have come to London
with him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) save on the understanding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was to be married
immediately upon arrival? This attitude of an indignant question was
not to be reconciled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) belief that his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) excuses for himself were
truthful. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not remark the discrepancy.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sarcasm wounded his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) vanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``If you don't choose to believe what I
say!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said nothing; but the sobs swept at intervals through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) frame,
shaking it.

<p/>Reading hesitation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) tried again. <div class="bookquote">``Come along, little
girl. And wipe your eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stepped back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) denied him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), passionately. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had esteemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) too
cheaply. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not care to be called `little girl.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what shall you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) inquired, in a tone which blended mockery
and bullying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was making a fool of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you what I shan't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't go to Paris.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sobs were less frequent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not my question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said icily. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know what you will
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was now no pretence of affectionateness either on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) part or on
his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). They might, to judge from their attitudes, have been nourished
from infancy on mutual hatred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that got to do with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's got everything to do with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can go and find out!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>It was girlish; it was childish; it was scarcely according to the
canons for conducting a final rupture; but it was not the less
tragically serious. Indeed, the spectacle of this young girl absurdly
behaving like one, in a serious crisis, increased the tragicalness of
the situation even if it did not heighten it. The idea that ran through
Gerald's brain was the ridiculous folly of having anything to do with
young girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was quite blind to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Go'?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) word. <div class="bookquote">``You mean that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I mean it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered promptly.

<p/>The coward in him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) urged him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) to take advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ignorant, helpless
pride, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) word. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) remembered the scene she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had made
at the pit shaft, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) said to himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) charm was not worth
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) temper, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) was a fool ever to have dreamed that it was,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) would be doubly a fool now not to seize the opportunity of
withdrawing from an insane enterprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) asked, with a sneer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course if you order me to leave you, I must. Can I do anything for
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) could not,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing? You're sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) turned towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'd leave me here without money or anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said in
a cold, cutting voice. And her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sneer was far more destructive than his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).
It destroyed in him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) the last trace of compassion for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I beg pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) said, and swaggeringly counted out five
sovereigns on to a chest of drawers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rushed at them. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I'll take your odious money?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
snarled, gathering the coins in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gloved hand.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first impulse was to throw them in his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) face; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paused and
then flung them into a corner of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pick them up!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) said briefly; and left, shutting the door.

<p/>Only a very little while, and they had been lovers, exuding tenderness
with every gesture, like a perfume! Only a very little while, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had been deciding to telegraph condescendingly to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was `all right'! And now the dream was utterly dissolved. And the voice
of that hard commonsense which spake to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wildest moods grew
loud in asserting that the enterprise could never have come to any
good, that it was from its inception an impossible enterprise,
unredeemed by the slightest justification. An enormous folly! Yes, an
elopement; but not like a real elopement; always unreal! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had always
known that it was only an imitation of an elopement, and must end in
some awful disappointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never truly wanted to run away; but
something within her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forward in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) protests.
The strict notions of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) elderly relatives were right after all. It
was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who had been wrong. And it was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who would have to pay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been a wicked girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said to herself grimly, in the midst of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ruin.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) faced the fact. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not repent; at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
never sit on that stool. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not exchange the remains of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
pride for the means of escape from the worst misery that life could
offer. On that point she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew herself. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) set to work to repair
and renew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pride.

<p/>Whatever happened she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not return to the Five Towns. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could
not, because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had stolen money from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Aunt Harriet. As much as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had thrown back at Gerald, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had filched from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt, but in the
form of a note. A prudent, mysterious instinct had moved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to take
this precaution. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was glad. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would never have been able to
dart that sneer at Gerald about money if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had really needed money.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rejoiced in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crime; though, since Aunt Harriet would
assuredly discover the loss at once, the crime eternally prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
from going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) family. Never, never would she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
mother with the eyes of a thief!

<p/>-LRB-In truth Aunt Harriet did discover the loss, and very creditably said
naught about it to anybody. The knowledge of it would have twisted the
knife in the maternal heart.-RRB-

<p/>Sophia was also glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had refused to proceed to Paris. The
recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) firmness in refusing flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) vanity as a girl
convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could take care of herself. To go to Paris unmarried
would have been an inconceivable madness. The mere thought of the
enormity did outrage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) moral susceptibilities. No, Gerald had most
perfectly mistaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) for another sort of girl; as, for instance, a
shop-assistant or a barmaid!

<p/>With this the catalogue of her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) satisfactions ended. She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) had no idea at
all as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) ought to do, or could do. The mere prospect of
venturing out of the room intimidated her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>). Had Gerald left her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) trunk in
the hall? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had. What a question! But what would happen to
her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>)? London ... London had merely dazed her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) could do nothing for
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) was as helpless as a rabbit in London. She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) drew aside the
window-curtain and had a glimpse of the river. It was inevitable that
she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) should think of suicide; for she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) could not suppose that any girl
had ever got herself into a plight more desperate than hers. <div class="bookquote">``I could
slip out at night and drown myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought seriously. <div class="bookquote">``A nice
thing that would be for Gerald!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Then loneliness, like a black midnight, overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), swiftly
wasting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strength, disintegrating her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pride in its horrid flood. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
glanced about for support, as a woman in the open street who feels she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
is going to faint, and went blindly to the bed, falling on it with the
upper part of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) body, in an attitude of abandonment. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wept, but
without sobbing.

<p/>II

<p/>Gerald Scales walked about the Strand, staring up at its high narrow
houses, crushed one against another as though they had been packed,
unsorted, by a packer who thought of nothing but economy of space.
Except by Somerset House, King's College, and one or two theatres and
banks, the monotony of mean shops, with several storeys unevenly
perched over them, was unbroken, Then Gerald encountered Exeter Hall,
and examined its prominent facade with a provincial's eye; for despite
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) travels he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was not very familiar with London. Exeter Hall naturally
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) mind back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) Uncle Boldero, that great and ardent
Nonconformist, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) own godly youth. It was laughable to muse upon
what his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) uncle would say and think, did the old man know that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
nephew had run away with a girl, meaning to seduce her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in Paris. It was
enormously funny!

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done with all that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well out of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had money to get home; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had nothing
to do but use the tongue in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. The rest was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
go to Paris alone, and find another amusement. It was absurd to have
supposed that Sophia would ever have suited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Not in such a family
as the Baineses could one reasonably expect to discover an ideal
mistress. No! there had been a mistake. The whole business was wrong.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had nearly made a fool of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was not the man to be made a
fool of. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) dignity intact.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said to himself. Yet all the time his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) dignity, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pride
also, were bleeding, dropping invisible blood along the length of the
Strand pavements.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was at Salisbury Street again. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in the bedroom. Damn
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) with an excessive desire. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hated to
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had been baulked. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hated to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would remain
immaculate. And he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) continued to picture her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in the exciting privacy of
that cursed bedroom.

<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was walking down Salisbury Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did not wish to be walking
down Salisbury Street; but there he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hell!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must go through with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) felt desperate. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was ready to pay any price in order to be able to
say to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had accomplished what he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) heart on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife hasn't gone out, has she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) asked of the hall-porter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure, sir; I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hall-porter</b></font>)</div>said the hall-porter.

<p/>The fear that Sophia had already departed made him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sick. When he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) trunk still there, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) took hope and ran upstairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), a dark crumpled, sinuous piece of humanity, half on and
half off the bed, silhouetted against the bluish-white counterpane; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
hat was on the floor, with the spotted veil trailing away from it. This
sight seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to be the most touching that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had ever seen,
though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face was hidden. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) forgot everything except the deep and
strange emotion which affected him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) approached the bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not
stir.

<p/>Having heard the entry and knowing that it must be Gerald who had
entered, Sophia forced herself to remain still. A wild, splendid hope
shot up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Constrained by all the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) will not to move,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not stifle a sob that had lain in ambush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) throat.

<p/>The sound of the sob fetched tears to the eyes of Gerald.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not stir. Another sob shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald. <div class="bookquote">``We'll stay in London till we can be
married. I'll arrange it. I'll find a nice boarding-house for you, and
I'll tell the people you're my cousin. I shall stay on at this hotel,
and I'll come and see you every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blubbered. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) little gloved hand was stretching out towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), like
a feeler; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) seized it, and knelt down and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) clumsily by the
waist. Somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) dared not kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) yet.

<p/>An immense relief surged very slowly through them both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I--really--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began to say something, but the articulation was
lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? What do you say, dearest?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) questioned eagerly.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made another effort. <div class="bookquote">``I really couldn't have gone to Paris with
you without being married,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) succeeded at last. <div class="bookquote">``I really couldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course you couldn't. It was I who was
wrong. But you didn't know how I felt... Sophia, it's all right now,
isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat up and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) fairly.

<p/>It was so wonderful and startling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) burst openly into tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
saw in the facile intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) emotion a guarantee of their future
happiness. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), so now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). They
clung together, equally surprised at the sweet, exquisite, blissful
melancholy which drenched them through and through. It was remorse for
having quarrelled, for having lacked faith in the supreme rightness of
the high adventure. Everything was right, and would be right; and they
had been criminally absurd. It was remorse; but it was pure bliss, and
worth the quarrel! Gerald resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) perfection again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
was the soul of goodness and honour! And for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was again the
ideal mistress, who would, however, be also a wife. As in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
rapidly ran over the steps necessary to their marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) kept saying
to himself, far off in some remote cavern of the brain: <div class="bookquote">``I shall have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! I shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>some cavern</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) did not reflect that this fragile slip of
the Baines stock, unconsciously drawing upon the accumulated strength
of generations of honest living, had put a defeat upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>).

<p/>After tea, Gerald, utterly content with the universe, redeemed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) word
and found an irreproachable boarding-house for Sophia in Westminster,
near the Abbey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was astonished at the glibness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) lies to the
landlady about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and about their circumstances generally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) also
found a church and a parson, close by, and in half an hour the
formalities preliminary to a marriage were begun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was now resident in London, it would be simpler to
recommence the business entirely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sagaciously agreed. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) by no
means wished to wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made no inquiry about those other
formalities which, owing to red-tape, had so unexpectedly proved
abortive! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was going to be married, and that sufficed. The
next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) carried out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) filial idea of telegraphing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother.




<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>SUPPER

<p/>I


<p/>They had been to Versailles and had dined there. A tram had sufficed to
take them out; but for the return, Gerald, who had been drinking
champagne, would not be content with less than a carriage. Further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
insisted on entering Paris by way of the Bois and the Arc de Triomphe.
Thoroughly to appease his (<font color='blue'><b>Bois</b></font>) conceit, it would have been necessary to
swing open the gates of honour in the Arc and allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Bois</b></font>) fiacre to pass
through; to be forced to drive round the monument instead of under it
hurt the sense of fitness which champagne engenders. Gerald was in all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pride that day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had been displaying the wonders to Sophia, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) could not escape the cicerone's secret feeling: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) himself was
somehow responsible for the wonders. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was exceedingly
satisfied with the effect produced by Sophia.

<p/>Sophia, on arriving in Paris with the ring on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) triumphant finger,
had timidly mentioned the subject of frocks. None would have guessed
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was possessed by the desire for French clothes
as by a devil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been surprised and delighted by the eagerness of
Gerald's response. Gerald, too, was possessed by a devil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) thirsted
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in French clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) knew some of the shops and ateliers in
the Rue de la Paix, the Rue de la Chaussee d``Antin, and the Palais
Royal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antin</b></font>) was much more skilled in the lore of frocks than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Antin</b></font>)
previous business in Paris had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Antin</b></font>) into relations with the
great firms; and Sophia suffered a brief humiliation in the discovery
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Antin</b></font>) private opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dresses was that they were not dresses
at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been aware that they were not Parisian, nor even of
London; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had thought them pretty good. It healed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wound,
however, to reflect that Gerald had so marvellously kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) own
counsel in order to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) self-love. Gerald had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to an
establishment in the Chaussee d``Antin. It was not one of what Gerald
called les grandes maisons, but it was on the very fringe of them, and
the real haute couture was practised therein; and Gerald was remembered
there by name.

<p/>Sophia had gone in trembling and ashamed, yet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart courageously
determined to emerge uncompromisingly French. But the models frightened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). They surpassed even the most fantastic things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had seen in
the streets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recoiled before them and seemed to hide for refuge in
Gerald, as it were appealing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) for moral protection, and answering
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) instead of to the saleswoman when the saleswoman offered remarks
in stiff English. The prices also frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>saleswoman</b></font>). The simplest trifle
here cost sixteen pounds; and her (<font color='blue'><b>saleswoman</b></font>) mother's historic <div class="bookquote">``silk,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>whose
elaborateness had cost twelve pounds, was supposed to have approached
the inexpressible! Gerald said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not to think about prices.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, however, forced by some instinct to think about prices--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
who at home had scorned the narrowness of life in the Square. In the
Square she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was understood to be quite without commonsense, hopelessly
imprudent; yet here, a spring of sagacity seemed to be welling up in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) all the time, a continual antidote against the general madness in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found herself. With extraordinary rapidity she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had formed a
habit of preaching moderation to Gerald. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hated to `see money thrown
away,'' and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) notion of the boundary line between throwing money away
and judiciously spending it was still the notion of the Square.

<p/>Gerald would laugh. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would say, piqued and blushing, but
self-sure: <div class="bookquote">``You can laugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was all deliciously agreeable.

<p/>On this evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wore the first of the new costumes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had worn it
all day. Characteristically she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had chosen something which was not too
special for either afternoon or evening, for either warm or cold
weather. It was of pale blue taffetas striped in a darker blue, with
the corsage cut in basques, and the underskirt of a similar taffetas,
but unstriped. The effect of the ornate overskirt falling on the plain
underskirt with its small double volant was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought, and Gerald
too, adorable. The waist was higher than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had had before, and
the crinoline expansive. Tied round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head with a large bow and
flying blue ribbons under the chin, was a fragile flat capote like a
baby's bonnet, which allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair to escape in front and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) great
chignon behind. A large spotted veil flew out from the capote over the
chignon. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) double skirts waved amply over Gerald's knees in the
carriage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) leaned back against the hard cushions and put an
arrogant look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face, and thought of nothing but the intense
throbbing joy of life, longing with painful ardour for more and more
pleasure, then and for ever.

<p/>As the carriage slipped downwards through the wide, empty gloom of the
Champs Elysees into the brilliant Paris that was waiting for them,
another carriage drawn by two white horses flashed upwards and was gone
in dust. Its only occupant, except the coachman and footman, was a
woman. Gerald stared after it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``That's Hortense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hortense Schneider/Hortense/Schneider</b></font>)</div><p/>It might have been Hortense, or it might not. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) instantly
convinced himself that it was. Not every evening did one meet Hortense
driving alone in the Champs Elysees, and in August too!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hortense?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Hortense Schneider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've never heard of Hortense Schneider?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Have you ever heard of Offenbach?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I don't know. I don't think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had the mien of utter incredulity. <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say you've
never heard of Bluebeard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard of Bluebeard, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who hasn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean the opera--Offenbach's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head, scarce knowing even what an opera was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! What next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) implied that such ignorance stood alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) experience. Really he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
was delighted at the cleanness of the slate on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had to write.
And Sophia was not a bit alarmed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) relished instruction from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
lips. It was a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to learn from that exhaustless store of
worldly knowledge. To the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) best to assume
omniscience in its ways, but to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) present mood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liked to
play the ignorant, uninitiated little thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the Schneider has been the rage since last year but
one. Absolutely the rage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do wish I'd noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as the Varietes reopens we'll go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) replied, and
then gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) detailed version of the career of Hortense Schneider.

<p/>More joys for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in the near future! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had yet scarcely penetrated
the crust of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bliss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exulted in the dazzling destiny which
comprised freedom, fortune, eternal gaiety, and the exquisite Gerald.

<p/>As they crossed the Place de la Concorde, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) inquired, <div class="bookquote">``Are we going
back to the hotel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I thought we'd go and have supper somewhere, if it
isn't too early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After all that dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All what dinner? You ate about five times as much as me, anyhow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm ready!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was. This day, because it was the first day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) French frock,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) regarded as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) debut in the dizzy life of capitals. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) existed in
a rapture of bliss, an ecstasy which could feel no fatigue, either of
body or spirit.

<p/>II

<p/>It was after midnight when they went into the Restaurant Sylvain;
Gerald, having decided not to go to the hotel, had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) mind and
called there, and having called there, had remained a long time: this
of course! Sophia was already accustoming herself to the idea that,
with Gerald, it was impossible to predict accurately more than five
minutes of the future.

<p/>As the chasseur held open the door for them to enter, and Sophia passed
modestly into the glowing yellow interior of the restaurant, followed
by Gerald in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) character of man-of-the-world, they drew the attention
of Sylvain's numerous and glittering guests. No face could have made a
more provocative contrast to the women's faces in those screened rooms
than the face of Sophia, so childlike between the baby's bonnet and the
huge bow of ribbon, so candid, so charmingly conscious of its own pure
beauty and of the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was no longer a virgin, but the equal
in knowledge of any woman alive. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), clustered about
the white tables, multitudes of violently red lips, powdered cheeks,
cold, hard eyes, self-possessed arrogant faces, and insolent bosoms.
What had impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than anything else in Paris, more even than
the three-horsed omnibuses, was the extraordinary self-assurance of all
the women, their unashamed posing, their calm acceptance of the public
gaze. They seemed to say: <div class="bookquote">``We are the renowned Parisiennes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They
frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): they appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so corrupt and so proud in their
corruption. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had already seen a dozen women in various situations of
conspicuousness apply powder to their complexions with no more ado than
if they had been giving a pat to their hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not understand
such boldness. As for them, they marvelled at the phenomena presented
in Sophia's person; they admired; they admitted the style of the gown;
but they envied neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) innocence nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty; they envied
nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) youth and the fresh tint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Encore des Anglais!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said some of them, as if that explained all.

<p/>Gerald had a very curt way with waiters; and the more obsequious they
were, the haughtier he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) became; and a head-waiter was no more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
than a scullion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) gave loud-voiced orders in French of which both he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
and Sophia were proud, and a table was laid for them in a corner near
one of the large windows. Sophia settled herself on the bench of green
velvet, and began to ply the ivory fan which Gerald had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). It
was very hot; all the windows were wide open, and the sounds of the
street mingled clearly with the tinkle of the supper-room. Outside,
against a sky of deepest purple, Sophia could discern the black
skeleton of a gigantic building; it was the new opera house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All sorts here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, contentedly, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had ordered iced
soup and sparkling Moselle. Sophia did not know what Moselle was, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) imagined that anything would be better than champagne.

<p/>Sylvain's was then typical of the Second Empire, and particularly
famous as a supper-room. Expensive and gay, it provided, with its
discreet decorations, a sumptuous scene where lorettes, actresses,
respectable women, and an occasional grisette in luck, could satisfy
their curiosity as to each other. In its catholicity it was highly
correct as a resort; not many other restaurants in the centre could
have successfully fought against the rival attractions of the Bois and
the dim groves of the Champs Elysees on a night in August. The
complicated richness of the dresses, the yards and yards of fine
stitchery, the endless ruching, the hints, more or less incautious, of
nether treasures of embroidered linen; and, leaping over all this to
the eye, the vivid colourings of silks and muslins, veils, plumes and
flowers, piled as it were pell-mell in heaps on the universal green
cushions to the furthest vista of the restaurant, and all multiplied in
gilt mirrors--the spectacle intoxicated Sophia. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes gleamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
drank the soup with eagerness, and tasted the wine, though no desire on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) part to like wine could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) like it; and then, seeing
pineapples on a large table covered with fruits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told Gerald that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should like some pineapple, and Gerald ordered one.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gathered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) self-esteem and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wits together, and began to give
Gerald her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) views on the costumes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could do so with impunity,
because her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own was indubitably beyond criticism. Some she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wholly
condemned, and there was not one which earned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) unreserved approval.
All the absurd fastidiousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) schoolgirlish provinciality
emerged in that eager, affected torrent of remarks. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
clever enough to read, after a time, in Gerald's tone and features,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was making a tedious fool of herself. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) adroitly shifted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) criticism from the taste to the WORK--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put a strong accent on
the word--and pronounced that to be miraculous beyond description. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
reckoned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew what dressmaking and millinery were, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
little fund of expert knowledge caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to picture a whole necessary
cityful of girls stitching, stitching, and stitching day and night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had wondered, during the few odd days that they had spent in Paris,
between visits to Chantilly and other places, at the massed luxury of
the shops; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had wondered, starting with St. Luke's Square as a
standard, how they could all thrive. But now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) first real glimpse
of the banal and licentious profusion of one among a hundred
restaurants, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered that the shops were so few. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought how
splendid was all this expensiveness for trade. Indeed, the notions
chasing each other within that lovely and foolish head were a
surprising medley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you think of Sylvain's?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald asked, impatient to be
assured that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) Sylvain's had duly overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gerald!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured, indicating that speech was inadequate. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) just furtively touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvain</b></font>) hand with hers.

<p/>The ennui due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) critical disquisition on the shortcomings of
Parisian costume cleared away from Gerald's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you suppose those people there are talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said
with a jerk of the head towards a chattering group of three gorgeous
lorettes and two middle-aged men at the next table but one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they talking about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're talking about the execution of the murderer Rivain that takes
place at Auxerre the day after to-morrow. They're arranging to make up
a party and go and see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a horrid idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guillotine, you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But can people see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think it's horrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's why people like to go and see it. Besides, the man isn't
an ordinary sort of criminal at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s very young and good-looking,
and well connected. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) killed the celebrated Claudine...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Claudine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Claudine Jacquinot. Of course you wouldn't know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claudine</b></font>) was a
tremendous--er--wrong `un here in the forties. Made a lot of money, and
retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudine</b></font>) native town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) efforts to maintain the role of a woman who has
nothing to learn, blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudine</b></font>) was older than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-five years older, if a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudine</b></font>) for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Claudine</b></font>) wouldn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enough money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claudine</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress--or rather
one of 'em. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted money for a young lady friend, you see. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) killed
her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and took all the jewels she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was wearing. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) always wore all her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) best jewels--and you may bet a woman like
that had a few. It seems she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been afraid for a long time that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
meant to do for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? And why did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jewels?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked being afraid, goose! Some women only enjoy
themselves when they're terrified. Queer, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerald insisted on meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) wife's gaze as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) finished these
revelations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pretended that such stories were the commonest things
on earth, and that to be scandalized by them was infantile. Sophia,
thrust suddenly into a strange civilization perfectly frank in its
sensuality and its sensuousness, under the guidance of a young man to
whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) half-formed intelligence was a most diverting toy--Sophia felt
mysteriously uncomfortable, disturbed by sinister, flitting phantoms of
ideas which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) only dimly apprehended. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes fell. Gerald laughed
self-consciously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not eat any more pineapple.

<p/>Immediately afterwards there came into the restaurant an apparition
which momentarily stopped every conversation in the room. It was a tall
and mature woman who wore over a dress of purplish-black silk a vast
flowing sortie de bal of vermilion velvet, looped and tasselled with
gold. No other costume could live by the side of that garment, Arab in
shape, Russian in colour, and Parisian in style. It blazed. The woman's
heavy coiffure was bound with fillets of gold braid and crimson
rosettes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was followed by a young Englishman in evening dress and
whiskers of the most exact correctness. The woman sailed, a little
breathlessly, to a table next to Gerald's, and took possession of it
with an air of use, almost of tedium. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down, threw the cloak
from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) majestic bosom, and expanded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chest. Seeming to ignore the
Englishman, who superciliously assumed the seat opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) large scornful eyes travel round the restaurant, slowly and
imperiously meeting the curiosity which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had evoked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty had
undoubtedly been dazzling, it was still effulgent; but the blossom was
about to fall. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was admirably rouged and powdered; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms were
glorious; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lashes were long. There was little fault, save the
excessive ripeness of a blonde who fights in vain against obesity. And
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clothes combined audacity with the propriety of fashion. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
carelessly deposed costly trinkets on the table, and then, having
intimidated the whole company, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accepted the menu from the
head-waiter and began to study it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's one of 'em!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald whispered to Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia whispered.

<p/>Gerald raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) eyebrows warningly, and winked. The Englishman had
overheard; and a look of frigid displeasure passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) proud
face. Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) belonged to a rank much higher than Gerald's; and
Gerald, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) could always comfort himself by the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
had been to a university with the best, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) own inferiority and
could not hide that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) felt it. Gerald was wealthy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) came of a
wealthy family; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had not the habit of wealth. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) spent money
furiously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) did it with bravado, too conscious of grandeur and too
conscious of the difficulties of acquiring that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) threw away.
For Gerald had earned money. This whiskered Englishman had never earned
money, never known the value of it, never imagined himself without as
much of it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) might happen to want. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had the face of one
accustomed to give orders and to look down upon inferiors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was
absolutely sure of himself. That his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) companion chiefly ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) did
not appear to incommode him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) in the least. She (<font color='blue'><b>inferiors</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) in French.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) replied in English, very briefly; and then, in English, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) commanded
the supper. As soon as the champagne was served he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) began to drink; in
the intervals of drinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) gently stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) whiskers. The woman
spoke no more.

<p/>Gerald talked more loudly. With that aristocratic Englishman observing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) could not remain at ease. And not only did he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) talk more loudly;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) brought into his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) conversation references to money, travels, and
worldly experiences. While seeking to impress the Englishman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was
merely becoming ridiculous to the Englishman; and obscurely he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was
aware of this. Sophia noticed and regretted it. Still, feeling very
unimportant herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was reconciled to the superiority of the
whiskered Englishman as to a natural fact. Gerald's behaviour slightly
lowered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) esteem. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)--at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) well-shaped
neatness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) vivacious face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) excellent clothes, and decided that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was much to be preferred to any heavy-jawed, long-nosed aristocrat
alive.

<p/>The woman whose vermilion cloak lay around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like a fortification
spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) escort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) did not understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) tried to express himself
in French, and failed. Then the woman recommenced, talking at length.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) head. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) acquaintance with French was
limited to the vocabulary of food.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guillotine!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) murmured, the sole word of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) discourse that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had
understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oui, oui! Guillotine. Enfin...!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cried the woman excitedly. Encouraged
by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) success in conveying even one word of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remarks, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began a
third time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald. <div class="bookquote">``Madame is talking about the execution at
Auxerre the day after to-morrow. N'est-ce-pas, madame, que vous parliez
de Rivain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Englishman glared angrily at Gerald's officious interruption. But
the woman smiled benevolently on Gerald, and insisted on talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
friend through him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). And the Englishman had to make the best of the
situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't a restaurant in Paris to-night where they aren't talking
about that execution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald on his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) own account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>observed the Englishman.

<p/>Wine affected them in different ways.

<p/>Now a fragile, short young Frenchman, with an extremely pale face
ending in a thin black imperial, appeared at the entrance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) looked
about, and, recognizing the woman of the scarlet cloak, very discreetly
saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) saw Gerald, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) worn, fatigued features showed
a sudden, startled smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) came rapidly forward, hat in hand, seized
Gerald's palm and greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) effusively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, with the solemn care of a man who is determined
to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) is entirely sober.

<p/>The young man became grave and excessively ceremonious. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed low
over Sophia's hand and kissed it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) impulse was to laugh, but the
gravity of the young man's deference stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glanced at
Gerald, blushing, as if to say: <div class="bookquote">``This comedy is not my fault.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald
said something, the young man turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) face resumed its
welcoming smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Monsieur Chirac,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald at length completed the introduction,
<div class="bookquote">``a friend of mine when I lived in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was proud to have met by accident an acquaintance in a restaurant.
It demonstrated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was a Parisian, and improved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) standing with
the whiskered Englishman and the vermilion cloak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the first time you come Paris, madame?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac addressed himself
to Sophia, in limping, timorous English.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) giggled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) bowed again.

<p/>Chirac, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) best compliments, felicitated Gerald upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mention it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said the humorous Gerald in English, amused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
own wit; and then: <div class="bookquote">``What about this execution?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>replied Chirac, breathing out a long breath, and smiling at
Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``Rivain! Rivain!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) made a large, important gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
hand.

<p/>It was at once to be seen that Gerald had touched the topic which
secretly ravaged the supper-world as a subterranean fire ravages a mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac, with pride, glancing at Sophia, who smiled
self-consciously.

<p/>Chirac entered upon a conversation with Gerald in French. Sophia
comprehended that Gerald was surprised and impressed by what Chirac
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) and that Chirac in turn was surprised. Then Gerald laboriously
found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pocket-book, and after some fumbling with it handed it to
Chirac so that the latter might write in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>murmured Chirac, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) ceremonious stiffness in order
to take leave. <div class="bookquote">``Alors, c'est entendu, mon cher ami!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said to Gerald,
who nodded phlegmatically. And Chirac went away to the next table but
one, where were the three lorettes and the two middle-aged men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was
received there with enthusiasm.

<p/>Sophia began to be teased by a little fear that Gerald was not quite
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) usual self. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) as tipsy. The idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
being tipsy would have shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not think clearly at all.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was lost and dazed in the labyrinth of new and vivid impressions
into which Gerald had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) prudence was awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'm tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want to go, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) asked, hurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, wait a bit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The owner</b></font>)</div><p/>The owner of the vermilion cloak spoke again to Gerald, who showed that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was flattered. While talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) ordered a brandy-and-soda.
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) could not refrain from displaying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) familiarity
with Parisian life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) related how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had met Hortense Schneider
behind a pair of white horses. The vermilion cloak grew even more
sociable at the mention of this resounding name, and chattered with the
most agreeable vivacity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) friend stared inimically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald explained to Sophia, who was sitting silent.
<div class="bookquote">``About Hortense Schneider--you know, we met her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to-night. It seems she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
made a bet of a louis with some fellow, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lost he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
the louis set in diamonds worth a hundred thousand francs. That's how
they go on here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>cried Sophia, further than ever in the labyrinth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Scuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>the Englishman put in heavily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had heard the words
<div class="bookquote">``Hortense Schneider,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hortense Schneider,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>repeating themselves in the
conversation, and at last it had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) that the conversation
was about Hortense Schneider. <div class="bookquote">''`Scuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hortense Schneider/Hortense/Schneider</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) began again. <div class="bookquote">``Are you--do
you mean Hortense Schneider?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald. <div class="bookquote">``We met her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s in Trouville,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman, flatly.

<p/>Gerald shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) head positively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave a supper to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in Trouville last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman.
<div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) plays at the Casino Theatre to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerald was repulsed but not defeated. <div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) playing in to-night?
Tell me that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) sneered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why I sh'd tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald retorted. <div class="bookquote">``If what you say is true, it's a very strange
thing I should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in the Champs Elysees to-night, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Englishman drank more wine. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to insult me, sir--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
began coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerald!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia urged in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald snapped.

<p/>A fiddler in fancy costume plunged into the restaurant at that moment
and began to play wildly. The shock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) strange advent momentarily
silenced the quarrel; but soon it leaped up again, under the shelter of
the noisy music,--the common, tedious, tippler's quarrel. It rose
higher and higher. The fiddler looked askance at it over his (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) fiddle.
Chirac cautiously observed it. Instead of attending to the music, the
festal company attended to the quarrel. Three waiters in a group
watched it with an impartial sporting interest. The English voices grew
more menacing.

<p/>Then suddenly the whiskered Englishman, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) head towards the
door, said more quietly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we better settle thish outside?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At your service!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, rising.

<p/>The owner of the vermilion cloak lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) eyebrows to Chirac in
fatigued disgust, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said nothing. Nor did Sophia say anything.
Sophia was overcome by terror.

<p/>The swain of the cloak, dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) coat after him (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) across the floor,
left the restaurant without offering any apology or explanation to his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>)
lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait here for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald defiantly to Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be back
in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Gerald!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) sleeve.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) snatched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) arm away. <div class="bookquote">``Wait here for me, I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>The doorkeeper obsequiously opened the door to the two unsteady
carousers, for whom the fiddler drew back, still playing.

<p/>Thus Sophia was left side by side with the vermilion cloak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
quite helpless. All the pride of a married woman had abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
stood transfixed by intense shame, staring painfully at a pillar, to
avoid the universal assault of eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt like an indiscreet little
girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked like one. No youthful radiant beauty of features,
no grace and style of a Parisian dress, no certificate of a ring, no
premature initiation into the mysteries, could save her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from the
appearance of a raw fool whose foolishness had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) undoing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
face changed to its reddest, and remained at that, and all the
fundamental innocence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nature, which had been overlaid by the
violent experiences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brief companionship with Gerald, rose again
to the surface with that blush. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) situation drew pity from a few
hearts and a careless contempt from the rest. But since once more it
was a question of ces Anglais, nobody could be astonished.

<p/>Without moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes to the clock: half-past
two. The fiddler ceased his (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) dance and made a collection in his (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>)
tasselled cap. The vermilion cloak threw a coin into the cap. Sophia
stared at it moveless, until the fiddler, tired of waiting, passed to
the next table and relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) agony. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no money at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) set
herself to watch the clock; but its fingers would not stir.

<p/>With an exclamation the lady of the cloak got up and peered out of the
window, chatted with waiters, and then removed herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cloak to
the next table, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was received with amiable sympathy by the
three lorettes, Chirac, and the other two men. The party
surreptitiously examined Sophia from time to time. Then Chirac went
outside with the head-waiter, returned, consulted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) friends, and
finally approached Sophia. It was twenty minutes past three.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) magnificent bow. <div class="bookquote">``Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said carefully, <div class="bookquote">``will you
allow me to bring you to your hotel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) made no reference to Gerald, partly, doubtless, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) English
was treacherous on difficult ground.

<p/>Sophia had not sufficient presence of mind to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saviour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the bill?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``The bill isn't paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saviour</b></font>) did not instantly understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But one of the waiters had caught
the sound of a familiar word, and sprang forward with a slip of paper
on a plate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with a feeble smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Je vous arrangerai ca,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>saviour</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What name of the hotel? Meurice, is
it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hotel Meurice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saviour</b></font>) spoke to the head-waiter about the bill, which was carried away like
something obscene; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>saviour</b></font>) arm, which he (<font color='blue'><b>saviour</b></font>) punctiliously offered and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not refuse, Sophia left the scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ignominy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was so
distraught that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) crinoline in the doorway. No
sign anywhere outside of Gerald or his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) foe!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into an open carriage, and in five minutes they had
clattered down the brilliant silence of the Rue de la Paix, through the
Place Vendome into the Rue de Rivoli; and the night-porter of the hotel
was at the carriage-step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell them at the restaurant where you gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac,
bare-headed under the long colonnade of the street. <div class="bookquote">``If your husband is
there, I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Till to-morrow...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) manners were more wonderful than any that Sophia had ever imagined.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) might have been in the dark Tuileries on the opposite side of the
street, saluting an empress, instead of taking leave of a raw little
girl, who was still too disturbed even to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fled candle in hand up the wide, many-cornered stairs; Gerald might
be already in the bedroom, ... drunk! There was a chance. But the
gilt-fringed bedroom was empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat down at the velvet-covered
table amid the shadows cast by the candle that wavered in the draught
from the open window. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) teeth and a cold fury possessed
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the hot and languorous night. Gerald was an imbecile. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
should have allowed himself to get tipsy was bad enough, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
should have exposed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the horrible situation from which Chirac had
extricated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), was unspeakably disgraceful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was an imbecile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had
no common sense. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) captivating charm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could not be relied
upon not to make himself and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ridiculous, tragically ridiculous.
Compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) with Mr. Chirac! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) leaned despairingly on the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would not undress. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not move. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had to realize her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) position;
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had to see it.

<p/>Folly! Folly! Fancy a commercial traveller throwing a compromising
piece of paper to the daughter of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) customer in the shop itself: that
was the incredible folly with which their relations had begun! And his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
mad gesture at the pit-shaft! And his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) scheme for bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to Paris
unmarried! And then to-night! Monstrous folly! Alone in the bedroom she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
was a wise and a disillusioned woman, wiser than any of those dolls in
the restaurant.

<p/>And had she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) not gone to Gerald, as it were, over the dead body of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
father, through lies and lies and again lies? That was how she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) phrased
it to herself... Over the dead body of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father! How could such a
venture succeed? How could she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ever have hoped that it would succeed?
In that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) acts with the terrible vision of a Hebrew
prophet.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought of the Square and of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) life there with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother and
Sophia. Never would her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pride allow her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to return to that life, not
even if the worst happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that could happen. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was one of
those who are prepared to pay without grumbling for what they have had.

<p/>There was a sound outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) noticed that the dawn had begun. The
door opened and disclosed Gerald.

<p/>They exchanged a searching glance, and Gerald shut the door. Gerald
infected the air, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) perceived at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was sobered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
lip was bleeding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Chirac brought me home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, curtly. <div class="bookquote">``I asked you to wait for me. Didn't
I say I should come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was adopting the injured magisterial tone of the man who is
ridiculously trying to conceal from himself and others that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) has
recently behaved like an ass.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) resented the injustice. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you need talk like that,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) bullied her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should be in the wrong.

<p/>And what a hard look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pretty face!

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) prudence bade her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) accept the injustice. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). Rapt away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own world, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was utterly dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) good nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knocked my chin against the damned balustrade, coming upstairs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, gloomily.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knew that was a lie. <div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) replied kindly. <div class="bookquote">``Let me bathe
it.''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>AN AMBITION SATISFIED

<p/>I


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went to sleep in misery. All the glory of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) new life had been
eclipsed. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) woke up, a few hours later, in the large,
velvety stateliness of the bedroom for which Gerald was paying so
fantastic a price per day, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was in a brighter mood, and very willing
to reconsider her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) verdicts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pride induced her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to put Gerald in the
right and herself in the wrong, for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was too proud to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
had married a charming and irresponsible fool. And, indeed, ought she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
not to put herself in the wrong? Gerald had told her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to wait, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
had not waited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) should return to the restaurant,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had returned. Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) not waited? She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had not waited because
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had behaved like a simpleton. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been terrified about nothing.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) not been frequenting restaurants now for a month past? Ought
not a married woman to be capable of waiting an hour in a restaurant
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lawful husband without looking a ninny? And as for Gerald's
behaviour, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) have acted differently? The other Englishman
was obviously a brute and had sought a quarrel. His (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) contradiction of
Gerald's statements was extremely offensive. On being invited by the
brute to go outside, what could Gerald do but comply? Not to have
complied might have meant a fight in the restaurant, as the brute was
certainly drunk. Compared to the brute, Gerald was not at all drunk,
merely a little gay and talkative. Then Gerald's fib about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) chin was
natural; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) simply wished to minimize the fuss and to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
feelings. It was, in fact, just like Gerald to keep perfect silence as
to what had passed between himself and the brute. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was
convinced that Gerald, so lithe and quick, had given that great brute
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) supercilious ways as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) received, if not better.

<p/>And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) were a man and had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) wife to wait in a restaurant,
and the wife had gone home under the escort of another man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) would
most assuredly be much more angry than Gerald had been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was very
glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had controlled herself and exercised a meek diplomacy. A
quarrel had thus been avoided. Yes, the finish of the evening could not
be called a quarrel; after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) nursing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) chin, nothing but a
slight coolness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) part had persisted.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) arose silently and began to dress, full of a determination to treat
Gerald as a good wife ought to treat a husband. Gerald did not stir; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
was an excellent sleeper: one of those organisms that never want to go
to bed and never want to get up. When her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) toilet was complete save for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bodice, there was a knock at the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerald!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) approached the bed, and leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nude bosom over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) neck. This method of being brought
back to consciousness did not displease him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/>The knock was repeated. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gave a grunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one's knocking at the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why don't you open it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked dreamily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not dressed, darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Stick something on your shoulders, girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What does it matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, being a simpleton again, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) resolution!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) obeyed, and cautiously opened the door, standing behind it.

<p/>A middle-aged whiskered servant, in a long white apron, announced
matters in French which passed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) understanding. But Gerald had heard
from the bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bien, monsieur!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The servant departed, with a bow, down the obscure
corridor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Chirac,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald explained when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had shut the door. <div class="bookquote">``I was
forgetting I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) to come and have lunch with us, early. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)'s
waiting in the drawing-room. Just put your bodice on, and go and talk
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) till I come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) jumped out of bed, and then, standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) night-garb, stretched
himself and terrifically yawned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia questioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, with that curious satiric dryness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
would sometimes import into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't speak French!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't suppose you could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, with an increase of dryness;
<div class="bookquote">``but you know as well as I do that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) can speak English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured with agreeable alacrity.

<p/>Evidently Gerald had not yet quite recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) legitimate
displeasure of the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) minutely examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) mouth in the glass
of the Louis Philippe wardrobe. It showed scarcely a trace of battle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), as, nervous at the prospect before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was leaving the room. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of going to Auxerre to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Auxerre?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) repeated, wondering under what circumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
recently heard that name. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered: it was the place of
execution of the murderer Rivain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Chirac has to go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)'s on a newspaper now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was an
architect when I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)'s got to go and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) thinks himself jolly
lucky. So I thought I'd go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The truth was that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had definitely arranged to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to see the execution?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stammered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? I've always wanted to see an execution, especially with the
guillotine. And executions are public in France. It's quite the proper
thing to go to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you want to see an execution?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It just happens that I do want to see an execution. It's a fancy of
mine, that's all. I don't know that any reason is necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said,
pouring out water into the diminutive ewer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was aghast. <div class="bookquote">``And shall you leave me here alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why my being married should prevent me
from doing something that I've always wanted to do. Do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eagerly concurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You can do exactly as you like. Either
stay here, or come with me. If you go to Auxerre there's no need at all
for you to see the execution. It's an interesting old town--cathedral
and so on. But of course if you can't bear to be in the same town as a
guillotine, I'll go alone. I shall come back to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was plain where his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) wish lay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stopped the phrases that came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips, and did her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) best to dismiss the thoughts which prompted them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said quietly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hesitated, and then went up
to the washstand and kissed a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) cheek that was not soapy.
That kiss, which comforted and somehow reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), was the
expression of a surrender whose monstrousness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not admit to
herself.

<p/>In the rich and dusty drawing-room, Chirac and Chirac's exquisite
formalities awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Nobody else was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband ...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began, smiling and blushing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liked Chirac.

<p/>It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had had the opportunity of using that word to
other than a servant. It soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) confidence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
perceived after a few moments that Chirac did genuinely admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>);
more, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) with something that resembled awe. Speaking
very slowly and distinctly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should travel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
husband to Auxerre; as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw no objection to that course; implying
that if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw no objection she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was perfectly satisfied. Chirac was
concurrence itself. In five minutes it seemed to be the most natural
and proper thing in the world that, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) honeymoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should be
going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) husband to a particular town because a notorious
murderer was about to be decapitated there in public.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband has always wanted to see an execution,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, later.
<div class="bookquote">``It would be a pity to ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As psychological experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>replied Chirac, pronouncing the p of the
adjective, <div class="bookquote">``it will be very interessant... To observe one's self, in
such circumstances ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) smiled enthusiastically.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought how strange even nice Frenchmen were. Imagine going to an
execution in order to observe yourself!

<p/>II

<p/>What continually impressed Sophia as strange, in the behaviour not only
of Gerald but of Chirac and other people with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) came into
contact, was its quality of casualness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life been
accustomed to see enterprises, even minor ones, well pondered and then
carefully schemed beforehand. In St. Luke's Square there was always, in
every head, a sort of time-table of existence prepared at least one
week in advance. But in Gerald's world nothing was prearranged.
Elaborate affairs were decided in a moment and undertaken with
extraordinary lightness. Thus the excursion to Auxerre! During lunch
scarcely a word was said as to it; the conversation, in English for
Sophia's advantage, turning, as usual under such circumstances, upon
the difficulty of languages and the differences between countries.
Nobody would have guessed that any member of the party had any
preoccupation whatever for the rest of the day. The meal was delightful
to Sophia; not merely did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) find Chirac comfortingly kind and
sincere, but Gerald was restored to the perfection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) charm and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
good humour. Then suddenly, in the midst of coffee, the question of
trains loomed up like a swift crisis. In five minutes Chirac had
departed--whether to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) office or his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) home Sophia did not understand,
and within a quarter of an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Gerald were driving rapidly to
the Gare de Lyon, Gerald stuffing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pocket a large envelope full
of papers which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had received by registered post. They caught the
train by about a minute, and Chirac by a few seconds. Yet neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
nor Gerald seemed to envisage the risk of inconvenience and annoyance
which they had incurred and escaped. Chirac chattered through the
window with another journalist in the next compartment. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
leisure to examine him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), Sophia saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) must have called at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) home
to put on old clothes. Everybody except herself and Gerald seemed to
travel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) oldest clothes.

<p/>The train was hot, noisy, and dusty. But, one after another, all three
of them fell asleep and slept heavily, calmly, like healthy and
exhausted young animals. Nothing could disturb them for more than a
moment. To Sophia it appeared to be by simple chance that Chirac
aroused himself and them at Laroche and sleepily seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) valise and
got them all out on the platform, where they yawned and smiled, full of
the deep, half-realized satisfaction of repose. They drank nectar from
a wheeled buffet, drank it eagerly, in thirsty gulps, and sighed with
pleasure and relief, and Gerald threw down a coin, refusing change with
a lord's gesture. The local train to Auxerre was full, and with a
varied and sinister cargo. At length they were in the zone of the
waiting guillotine. The rumour ran that the executioner was on the
train. No one had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>); no one was sure of recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>), but
everyone hugged the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was on the train. Although the sun
was sinking the heat seemed not to abate. Attitudes grew more limp,
more abandoned. Soot and prickly dust flew in unceasingly at the open
windows. The train stopped at Bonnard, Chemilly, and Moneteau, each
time before a waiting crowd that invaded it. And at last, in the great
station at Auxerre, it poured out an incredible mass of befouled
humanity that spread over everything like an inundation. Sophia was
frightened. Gerald left the initiative to Chirac, and Chirac took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
arm and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) forward, looking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) to see that Gerald followed
with the valise. Frenzy seemed to reign in Auxerre.

<p/>The driver of a cab demanded ten francs for transporting them to the
Hotel de l``Epee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>scornfully exclaimed Chirac, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) quality of experienced
Parisian who is not to be exploited by heavy-witted provincials.

<p/>But the driver of the next cab demanded twelve francs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jump in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald to Sophia. Chirac lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) eyebrows.

<p/>At the same moment a tall, stout man with the hard face of a
flourishing scoundrel, and a young, pallid girl on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) arm, pushed
aside both Gerald and Chirac and got into the cab with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) companion.

<p/>Chirac protested, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) that the cab was already engaged.

<p/>The usurper scowled and swore, and the young girl laughed boldly.

<p/>Sophia, shrinking, expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) escort to execute justice heroic and
final; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brute!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>murmured Chirac, and shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shoulders, as the carriage
drove off, leaving them foolish on the kerb.

<p/>By this time all the other cabs had been seized. They walked to the
Hotel de l``Epee, jostled by the crowd, Sophia and Chirac in front, and
Gerald following with the valise, whose weight caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) to lean over
to the right and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) left arm to rise. The avenue was long, straight,
and misty with a floating dust. Sophia had a vivid sense of the
romantic. They saw towers and spires, and Chirac talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) slowly
and carefully of the cathedral and the famous churches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said that
the stained glass was marvellous, and with much care he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) catalogued for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) all the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must visit. They crossed a river. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt as
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was stepping into the middle age. At intervals Gerald
changed the valise from hand to hand; obstinately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) would not let
Chirac touch it. They struggled upwards, through narrow curving streets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Voila!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac.

<p/>They were in front of the Hotel de l``Epee. Across the street was a cafe
crammed with people. Several carriages stood in front. The Hotel de
l``Epee had a reassuring air of mellow respectability, such as Chirac
had claimed for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had suggested this hotel for Madame Scales
because it was not near the place of execution. Gerald had said, <div class="bookquote">``Of
course! Of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Chirac, who did not mean to go to bed, required no
room for himself.

<p/>The Hotel de l``Epee had one room to offer, at the price of twenty-five
francs.

<p/>Gerald revolted at the attempted imposition. <div class="bookquote">``A nice thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
grumbled, <div class="bookquote">``that ordinary travellers can't get a decent room at a decent
price just because some one's going to be guillotined to-morrow! We'll
try elsewhere!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) features expressed disgust, but Sophia fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was secretly
pleased.

<p/>They swaggered out of the busy stir of the hotel, as those must who,
having declined to be swindled, wish to preserve their importance in
the face of the world. In the street a cabman solicited them, and
filled them with hope by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) knew of a hotel that might suit
them and would drive them there for five francs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) furiously lashed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) horse. The mere fact of being in a swiftly moving carriage which
wayfarers had to avoid nimbly, maintained their spirits. They had a
near glimpse of the cathedral. The cab halted with a bump, in a small
square, in front of a repellent building which bore the sign, <div class="bookquote">``Hotel de
Vezelay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The horse was bleeding. Gerald instructed Sophia to remain
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) and Chirac went up four stone steps into the
hotel. Sophia, stared at by loose crowds that were promenading, gazed
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and saw that all the windows of the square were open and
most of them occupied by people who laughed and chattered. Then there
was a shout: Gerald's voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had appeared at a window on the second
floor of the hotel with Chirac and a very fat woman. Chirac saluted,
and Gerald laughed carelessly, and nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, having descended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do they ask?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia inquired indiscreetly.

<p/>Gerald hesitated, and looked self-conscious. <div class="bookquote">``Thirty-five francs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``But I've had enough of driving about. It seems we're lucky to
get it even at that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div><p/>And Chirac shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shoulders as if to indicate that the situation
and the price ought to be accepted philosophically. Gerald gave the
driver five francs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) examined the piece and demanded a pourboire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Damn!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, and, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had no smaller change, parted
with another two francs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is any one coming out for this damned valise?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald demanded, like a
tyrant whose wrath would presently fall if the populace did not
instantly set about minding their p's and q's.

<p/>But nobody emerged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was compelled to carry the bag himself.

<p/>The hotel was dark and malodorous, and every room seemed to be crowded
with giggling groups of drinkers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't both sleep in this bed, surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia when, Chirac
having remained downstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) faced Gerald in a small, mean bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't suppose I shall go to bed, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>said Gerald, rather
brusquely. <div class="bookquote">``It's for you. We're going to eat now. Look sharp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>III

<p/>It was night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lay in the narrow, crimson-draped bed. The heavy
crimson curtains had been drawn across the dirty lace curtains of the
window, but the lights of the little square faintly penetrated through
chinks into the room. The sounds of the square also penetrated,
extraordinarily loud and clear, for the unabated heat had compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
to leave the window open. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not sleep. Exhausted though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was, there was no hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) being able to sleep.

<p/>Once again she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was profoundly depressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered the dinner with
horror. The long, crowded table, with semi-circular ends, in the
oppressive and reeking dining-room lighted by oil-lamps! There must
have been at least forty people at that table. Most of them ate
disgustingly, as noisily as pigs, with the ends of the large coarse
napkins tucked in at their necks. All the service was done by the fat
woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen at the window with Gerald, and a young girl
whose demeanour was candidly brazen. Both these creatures were
slatterns. Everything was dirty. But the food was good. Chirac and
Gerald were agreed that the food was good, as well as the wine.
<div class="bookquote">``Remarquable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac had said, of the wine. Sophia, however, could
neither eat nor drink with relish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was afraid. The company shocked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) by its gestures alone. It was very heterogeneous in appearance,
some of the diners being well dressed, approaching elegance, and others
shabby. But all the faces, to the youngest, were brutalized, corrupt,
and shameless. The juxtaposition of old men and young women was odious
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), especially when those pairs kissed, as they did frequently
towards the end of the meal. Happily she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was placed between Chirac and
Gerald. That situation seemed to shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) even from the
conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have comprehended nothing of the conversation,
had it not been for the presence of a middle-aged Englishman who sat at
the opposite end of the table with a youngish, stylish Frenchwoman whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) had seen at Sylvain's on the previous night. The Englishman was
evidently under a promise to teach English to the Frenchwoman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) kept
translating for her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) into English, slowly and distinctly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) would
repeat the phrases after him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), with strange contortions of the mouth.

<p/>Thus Sophia gathered that the talk was exclusively about
assassinations, executions, criminals, and executioners. Some of the
people there made a practice of attending every execution. They were
fountains of interesting gossip, and the lions of the meal. There was a
woman who could recall the dying words of all the victims of justice
for twenty years past. The table roared with hysteric laughter at one
of this woman's anecdotes. Sophia learned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had related how a
criminal had said to the priest who was good-naturedly trying to screen
the sight of the guillotine from him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) body: <div class="bookquote">``Stand away now,
parson. Haven't I paid to see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Such was the Englishman's rendering.
The wages of the executioners and their assistants were discussed, and
differences of opinions led to ferocious arguments. A young and
dandiacal fellow told, as a fact which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was ready to vouch for with a
pistol, how Cora Pearl, the renowned English courtesan, had through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
influence over a prefect of police succeeded in visiting a criminal
alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) cell during the night preceding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) execution, and had
only quitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) an hour before the final summons. The tale won the
honours of the dinner. It was regarded as truly impressive, and
inevitably it led to the general inquiry: what could the highest
personages in the empire see to admire in that red-haired Englishwoman?
And of course Rivain himself, the handsome homicide, the centre and
hero of the fete, was never long out of the conversation. Several of
the diners had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>); one or two knew him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) and could give amazing
details of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) prowess as a man of pleasure. Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) crime, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
seemed to be the object of sincere idolatry. It was said positively
that a niece of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) victim had been promised a front place at the
execution.

<p/>Apropos of this, Sophia gathered, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) intense astonishment and
alarm, that the prison was close by and that the execution would take
place at the corner of the square itself in which the hotel was
situated. Gerald must have known; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had hidden it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) sideways, with distrust. As the dinner finished, Gerald's
pose of a calm, disinterested, scientific observer of humanity
gradually broke down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) could not maintain it in front of the
increasing license of the scene round the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was at length
somewhat ashamed of having exposed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) wife to the view of such an
orgy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) restless glance carefully avoided both Sophia and Chirac. The
latter, whose unaffected simplicity of interest in the affair had more
than anything helped to keep Sophia in countenance, observed the change
in Gerald and Sophia's excessive discomfort, and suggested that they
should leave the table without waiting for the coffee. Gerald agreed
quickly. Thus had Sophia been released from the horror of the dinner.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not understand how a man so thoughtful and kindly as Chirac--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
had bidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) good night with the most distinguished courtesy--could
tolerate, much less pleasurably savour, the gluttonous, drunken, and
salacious debauchery of the Hotel de Vezelay; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) theory was, so
far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could judge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) imperfect English, that whatever
existed might be admitted and examined by serious persons interested in
the study of human nature. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) face seemed to say: <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) face
seemed to say to Gerald and to herself: <div class="bookquote">``If this incommodes you, what
did you come for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerald had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at the bedroom door with a self-conscious nod. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had partly undressed and lain down, and instantly the hotel had
transformed itself into a kind of sounding-box. It was as if, beneath
and within all the noises of the square, every movement in the hotel
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ears through cardboard walls: distant shoutings and
laughter below; rattlings of crockery below; stampings up and down
stairs; stealthy creepings up and down stairs; brusque calls; fragments
of song, whisperings; long sighs suddenly stifled; mysterious groans as
of torture, broken by a giggle; quarrels and bickering,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was spared
nothing in the strangely resonant darkness.

<p/>Then there came out of the little square a great uproar and commotion,
with shrieks, and under the shrieks a confused din. In vain she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face into the pillow and listened to the irregular, prodigious
noise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyelashes as they scraped the rough linen. The thought had
somehow introduced itself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must arise and go to
the window and see all that was to be seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) resisted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to
herself that the idea was absurd, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not wish to go to the
window. Nevertheless, while arguing with herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) well knew that
resistance to the thought was useless and that ultimately her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) legs
would obey its command.

<p/>When ultimately she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) yielded to the fascination and went to the window
and pulled aside one of the curtains, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a feeling of relief. The
cool, grey beginnings of dawn were in the sky, and every detail of the
square was visible. Without exception all the windows were wide open
and filled with sightseers. In the background of many windows were
burning candles or lamps that the far distant approach of the sun was
already killing. In front of these, on the frontier of two mingling
lights, the attentive figures of the watchers were curiously
silhouetted. On the red-tiled roofs, too, was a squatted population.
Below, a troop of gendarmes, mounted on caracoling horses stretched in
line across the square, was gradually sweeping the entire square of a
packed, gesticulating, cursing crowd. The operation of this immense
besom was very slow. As the spaces of the square were cleared they
began to be dotted by privileged persons, journalists or law officers
or their friends, who walked to and fro in conscious pride; among them
Sophia descried Gerald and Chirac, strolling arm-in-arm and talking to
two elaborately clad girls, who were also arm-in-arm.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw a red reflection coming from one of the side streets of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a vista; it was the swinging lantern of a waggon drawn by
a gaunt grey horse. The vehicle stopped at the end of the square from
which the besom had started, and it was immediately surrounded by the
privileged, who, however, were soon persuaded to stand away. The crowd
amassed now at the principal inlets of the square, gave a formidable
cry and burst into the refrain--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Le voila! Nicolas! Ah! Ah! Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>workmen</b></font>)</div><p/>The clamour became furious as a group of workmen in blue blouses drew
piece by piece all the components of the guillotine from the waggon and
laid them carefully on the ground, under the superintendence of a man
in a black frock-coat and a silk hat with broad flat brims; a little
fussy man of nervous gestures. And presently the red columns had risen
upright from the ground and were joined at the top by an acrobatic
climber. As each part was bolted and screwed to the growing machine the
man in the high hat carefully tested it. In a short time that seemed
very long, the guillotine was finished save for the triangular steel
blade which lay shining on the ground, a cynosure. The executioner
pointed to it, and two men picked it up and slipped it into its groove,
and hoisted it to the summit of the machine. The executioner peered at
it interminably amid a universal silence. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) actuated the
mechanism, and the mass of metal fell with a muffled, reverberating
thud. There were a few faint shrieks, blended together, and then an
overpowering racket of cheers, shouts, hootings, and fragments of song.
The blade was again lifted, instantly reproducing silence, and again it
fell, liberating a new bedlam. The executioner made a movement of
satisfaction. Many women at the windows clapped enthusiastically, and
the gendarmes had to fight brutally against the fierce pressure of the
crowd. The workmen doffed their blouses and put on coats, and Sophia
was disturbed to see them coming in single file towards the hotel,
followed by the executioner in the silk hat.

<p/>IV

<p/>There was a tremendous opening of doors in the Hotel de Vezelay, and
much whispering on thresholds, as the executioner and his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) band entered
solemnly. Sophia heard them tramp upstairs; they seemed to hesitate,
and then apparently went into a room on the same landing as hers. A
door banged. But Sophia could hear the regular sound of new voices
talking, and then the rattling of glasses on a tray. The conversation
which came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from the windows of the hotel now showed a great
increase of excitement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not see the people at these
neighbouring windows without showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own head, and this she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
not do. The boom of a heavy bell striking the hour vibrated over the
roofs of the square; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) supposed that it might be the cathedral clock.
In a corner of the square she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw Gerald talking vivaciously alone with
one of the two girls who had been together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered vaguely how
such a girl had been brought up, and what her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) parents thought--or knew!
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of an intense pride in herself, of a measureless
haughty feeling of superiority.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eye caught the guillotine again, and was held by it. Guarded by
gendarmes, that tall and simple object did most menacingly dominate the
square with its crude red columns. Tools and a large open box lay on
the ground beside it. The enfeebled horse in the waggon had an air of
dozing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) twisted legs. Then the first rays of the sun shot
lengthwise across the square at the level of the chimneys; and Sophia
noticed that nearly all the lamps and candles had been extinguished.
Many people at the windows were yawning; they laughed foolishly after
they had yawned. Some were eating and drinking. Some were shouting
conversations from one house to another. The mounted gendarmes were
still pressing back the feverish crowds that growled at all the inlets
to the square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw Chirac walking to and fro alone. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
not find Gerald. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) could not have left the square. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had
returned to the hotel and would come up to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was comfortable
or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) needed anything. Guiltily she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sprang back into bed. When last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had surveyed the room it had been dark; now it was bright and every
detail stood clear. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had the sensation of having been at the
window only a few minutes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) waited. But Gerald did not come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could hear chiefly the steady
hum of the voices of the executioner and his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) aids. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reflected that
the room in which they were must be at the back. The other sounds in
the hotel grew less noticeable. Then, after an age, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard a door
open, and a low voice say something commandingly in French, and then a
<div class="bookquote">``Oui, monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and a general descent of the stairs. The executioner
and his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) aids were leaving. <div class="bookquote">``You,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>cried a drunken English voice from an
upper floor--it was the middle-aged Englishman translating what the
executioner had said--<div class="bookquote">``you, you will take the head.''  (<font color='red'><b>the executioner</b></font>)</div>Then a rough
laugh, and the repeating voice of the Englishman's girl, still pursuing
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) studies in English: <div class="bookquote">``You will take ze `ead. Yess, sair.''  (<font color='red'><b>Englishman girl</b></font>)</div>And
another laugh. At length quiet reigned in the hotel. Sophia said to
herself: <div class="bookquote">``I won't stir from this bed till it's all over and Gerald
comes back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dozed, under the sheet, and was awakened by a tremendous shrieking,
growling, and yelling: a phenomenon of human bestiality that far
surpassed Sophia's narrow experiences. Shut up though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in a
room, perfectly secure, the mad fury of that crowd, balked at the
inlets to the square, thrilled and intimidated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). It sounded as if
they would be capable of tearing the very horses to pieces. <div class="bookquote">``I must
stay where I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured. And even while saying it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rose and
went to the window again and peeped out. The torture involved was
extreme, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not sufficient force within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to resist the
fascination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stared greedily into the bright square. The first
thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw was Gerald coming out of a house opposite, followed after
a few seconds by the girl with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had previously been talking.
Gerald glanced hastily up at the facade of the hotel, and then
approached as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) could to the red columns, in front of which
were now drawn a line of gendarmes with naked swords. A second and
larger waggon, with two horses, waited by the side of the other one.
The racket beyond the square continued and even grew louder. But the
couple of hundred persons within the cordons, and all the inhabitants
of the windows, drunk and sober, gazed in a fixed and sinister
enchantment at the region of the guillotine, as Sophia gazed. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot
stand this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told herself in horror, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not move; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could not move even her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>At intervals the crowd would burst out in a violent staccato--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Le voila! Nicholas! Ah! Ah! Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the final ``Ah' was devilish.

<p/>Then a gigantic passionate roar, the culmination of the mob's fierce
savagery, crashed against the skies. The line of maddened horses
swerved and reared, and seemed to fall on the furious multitude while
the statue-like gendarmes rocked over them. It was a last effort to
break the cordon, and it failed.

<p/>From the little street at the rear of the guillotine appeared a priest,
walking backwards, and holding a crucifix high in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) right hand, and
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) came the handsome hero, his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) body all crossed with cords,
between two warders, who pressed against him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) and supported him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) on
either side. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was certainly very young. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) chin gallantly,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) face was incredibly white. Sophia discerned that the priest was
trying to hide the sight of the guillotine from the prisoner with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
body, just as in the story which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had heard at dinner.

<p/>Except the voice of the priest, indistinctly rising and falling in the
prayer for the dying, there was no sound in the square or its environs.
The windows were now occupied by groups turned to stone with distended
eyes fixed on the little procession. Sophia had a tightening of the
throat, and the hand trembled by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) held the curtain. The
central figure did not seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to be alive; but rather a doll, a
marionette wound up to imitate the action of a tragedy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw the
priest offer the crucifix to the mouth of the marionette, which with a
clumsy unhuman shoving of its corded shoulders butted the thing away.
And as the procession turned and stopped she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could plainly see that the
marionette's nape and shoulders were bare, his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) shirt having been slit.
It was horrible. <div class="bookquote">``Why do I stay here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked herself hysterically.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not stir. The victim had disappeared now in the midst of a
group of men. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) prone under the red column,
between the grooves. The silence was now broken only by the tinkling of
the horses' bits in the corners of the square. The line of gendarmes in
front of the scaffold held their swords tightly and looked over their
noses, ignoring the privileged groups that peered almost between their
shoulders.

<p/>And Sophia waited, horror-struck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw nothing but the gleaming
triangle of metal that was suspended high above the prone, attendant
victim. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt like a lost soul, torn too soon from shelter, and
exposed for ever to the worst hazards of destiny. Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in this
strange, incomprehensible town, foreign and inimical to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), watching
with agonized glance this cruel, obscene spectacle? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sensibilities
were all a bleeding mass of wounds. Why? Only yesterday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
been, an innocent, timid creature in Bursley, in Axe, a foolish
creature who deemed the concealment of letters a supreme excitement.
Either that day or this day was not real. Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) imprisoned alone
in that odious, indescribably odious hotel, with no one to soothe and
comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) away?

<p/>The distant bell boomed once. Then a monosyllabic voice sounded, sharp,
low, nervous; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recognized the voice of the executioner, whose name
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had heard but could not remember. There was a clicking noise.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shrank down to the floor in terror and loathing, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face,
and shuddered. Shriek after shriek, from various windows, rang on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
ears in a fusillade; and then the mad yell of the penned crowd, which,
like herself, had not seen but had heard, extinguished all other noise.
Justice was done. The great ambition of Gerald's life was at last
satisfied.

<p/>Later, amid the stir of the hotel, there came a knock at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door,
impatient and nervous. Forgetting, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tribulation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bodice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) got up from the floor in a kind of miserable
dream, and opened. Chirac stood on the landing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had Gerald by
the arm. Chirac looked worn out, curiously fragile and pathetic; but
Gerald was the very image of death. The attainment of ambition had
utterly destroyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) equilibrium; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) curiosity had proved itself
stronger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) stomach. Sophia would have pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in that
moment been capable of pity. Gerald staggered past her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into the room,
and sank with a groan on to the bed. Not long since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had been proudly
conversing with impudent women. Now, in swift collapse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was as
flaccid as a sick hound and as disgusting as an aged drunkard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is some little souffrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac, weakly.

<p/>Sophia perceived in Chirac's tone the assumption that of course her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
present duty was to devote herself to the task of restoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shamed
husband to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) manly pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought bitterly.

<p/>The fat woman ascended the stairs like a tottering blancmange, and
began to gabble to Sophia, who understood nothing whatever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wants sixty francs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac said, and in answer to Sophia's
startled question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) explained that Gerald had agreed to pay a hundred
francs for the room, which was the landlady's own--fifty francs in
advance and the fifty after the execution. The other ten was for the
dinner. The landlady, distrusting the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) clientele, was
collecting her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) accounts instantly on the completion of the spectacle.

<p/>Sophia made no remark as to Gerald's lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Indeed, Chirac had
heard it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew Gerald for a glib liar to others, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
naively surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) practised upon herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerald! Do you hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said coldly.

<p/>The amateur of severed heads only groaned.

<p/>With a movement of irritation she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) and felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pockets
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) purse; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) acquiesced, still groaning. Chirac helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to
choose and count the coins.

<p/>The fat woman, appeased, pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, madame!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) customary courtliness,
transforming the landing of the hideous hotel into some imperial
antechamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going away?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, in surprise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) distress was so
obvious that it tremendously flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) would have stayed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
could. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had to return to Paris to write and deliver his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) article.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, I hope!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) murmured sympathetically, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. The
gesture atoned somewhat for the sordidness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation, and even
corrected the faults of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attire. Always afterwards it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that Chirac was an old and intimate friend; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had successfully passed
through the ordeal of seeing `the wrong side' of the stuff of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shut the door on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) with a lingering glance, and reconciled
herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) predicament.

<p/>Gerald slept. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) slept heavily.

<p/>This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to, then! The horrors of the night, of
the dawn, and of the morning! Ineffable suffering and humiliation;
anguish and torture that could never be forgotten! And after a fatuous
vigil of unguessed license, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had tottered back, an offensive beast,
to sleep the day away in that filthy chamber! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) did not possess even
enough spirit to play the role of roysterer to the end. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>); far, far from any other human aid; cut off irrevocably by
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pride from those who perhaps would have protected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
dangerous folly. The deep conviction henceforward formed a permanent
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) general consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was simply an irresponsible
and thoughtless fool! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was without sense. Such was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brilliant and
godlike husband, the man who had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the right to call herself a
married woman! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a fool. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ignorance of the world she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
could see that nobody but an arrant imbecile could have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to
the present pass. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) native sagacity revolted. Gusts of feeling came
over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could have thrashed him (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) into the realization of
his (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) responsibilities.

<p/>Sticking out of the breast-pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) soiled coat was the packet
which he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) had received on the previous day. If he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) had not already lost
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) could only thank his (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) luck. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took it. There were English
bank-notes in it for two hundred pounds, a letter from a banker, and
other papers. With precautions against noise she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tore the envelope and
the letter and papers into small pieces, and then looked about for a
place to hide them. A cupboard suggested itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got on a chair,
and pushed the fragments out of sight on the topmost shelf, where they
may well be to this day. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finished dressing, and then sewed the
notes into the lining of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no silly, delicate notions
about stealing. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) obscurely felt that, in the care of a man like
Gerald, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might find herself in the most monstrous, the most
impossible dilemmas. Those notes, safe and secret in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt, gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confidence, reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) against the perils of the future, and
endowed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with independence. The act was characteristic of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
enterprise and of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fundamental prudence. It approached the heroic.
And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conscience hotly defended its righteousness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decided that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) loss, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would merely deny all
knowledge of the envelope, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had not spoken a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) about
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) never mentioned the details of money; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had a fortune. However,
the necessity for this untruth did not occur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) made no reference
whatever to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) loss. The fact was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had been careless
enough to let the envelope be filched from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) during the excesses of
the night.

<p/>All day till evening Sophia sat on a dirty chair, without food, while
Gerald slept. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kept repeating to herself, in amazed resentment: <div class="bookquote">``A
hundred francs for this room! A hundred francs! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) hadn't the pluck
to tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not have expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) contempt.

<p/>Long before sheer ennui forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to look out of the window again,
every sign of justice had been removed from the square. Nothing
whatever remained in the heavy August sunshine save gathered heaps of
filth where the horses had reared and caracoled.




<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>A CRISIS FOR GERALD

<p/>I


<p/>For a time there existed in the minds of both Gerald and Sophia the
remarkable notion that twelve thousand pounds represented the infinity
of wealth, that this sum possessed special magical properties which
rendered it insensible to the process of subtraction. It seemed
impossible that twelve thousand pounds, while continually getting less,
could ultimately quite disappear. The notion lived longer in the mind
of Gerald than in that of Sophia; for Gerald would never look at a
disturbing fact, whereas Sophia's gaze was morbidly fascinated by such
phenomena. In a life devoted to travel and pleasure Gerald meant not to
spend more than six hundred a year, the interest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) fortune. Six
hundred a year is less than two pounds a day, yet Gerald never paid
less than two pounds a day in hotel bills alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was
living on a thousand a year, had a secret fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) might be
spending fifteen hundred, and was really spending about two thousand
five hundred. Still, the remarkable notion of the inexhaustibility of
twelve thousand pounds always reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). The faster the money went,
the more vigorously this notion flourished in Gerald's mind. When
twelve had unaccountably dwindled to three, Gerald suddenly decided
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) must act, and in a few months he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) lost two thousand on the Paris
Bourse. The adventure frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) panic he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) scattered a
couple of hundred in a frenzy of high living.

<p/>But even with only twenty thousand francs left out of three hundred
thousand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) held closely to the belief that natural laws would in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
case somehow be suspended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had heard of men who were once rich
begging bread and sweeping crossings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) felt quite secure against
such risks, by simple virtue of the axiom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
meant to assist the axiom by efforts to earn money. When these
continued to fail, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) tried to assist the axiom by borrowing money; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) uncle had definitely done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) would have
assisted the axiom by stealing money, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had neither the nerve nor
the knowledge to be a swindler; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was not even sufficiently expert to
cheat at cards.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had thought in thousands. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) began to think in hundreds, in
tens, daily and hourly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) paid two hundred francs in railway fares in
order to live economically in a village, and shortly afterwards another
two hundred francs in railway fares in order to live economically in
Paris. And to celebrate the arrival in Paris and the definite
commencement of an era of strict economy and serious search for a
livelihood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) spent a hundred francs on a dinner at the Maison Doree
and two balcony stalls at the Gymnase. In brief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) omitted nothing--no
act, no resolve, no self-deception--of the typical fool in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
situation; always convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) difficulties and his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wisdom were
quite exceptional.

<p/>In May, 1870, on an afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was ranging nervously to and fro in a
three-cornered bedroom of a little hotel at the angle of the Rue
Fontaine and the Rue Laval -LRB-now the Rue Victor Masse-RRB-, within half a
minute of the Boulevard de Clichy. It had come to that--an exchange of
the `grand boulevard' for the `boulevard exterieur'! Sophia sat on a
chair at the grimy window, glancing down in idle disgust of life at the
Clichy-Odeon omnibus which was casting off its tip-horse at the corner
of the Rue Chaptal. The noise of petty, hurried traffic over the bossy
paving stones was deafening. The locality was not one to correspond
with an ideal. There was too much humanity crowded into those narrow
hilly streets; humanity seemed to be bulging out at the windows of the
high houses. Gerald healed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) pride by saying that this was, after
all, the real Paris, and that the cookery was as good as could be got
anywhere, pay what you would. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) seldom ate a meal in the little salons
on the first floor without becoming ecstatic upon the cookery. To hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) might have chosen the hotel on its superlative merits, without
regard to expense. And with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) air of use and custom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) did indeed
look like a connoisseur of Paris who knew better than to herd with
vulgar tourists in the pens of the Madeleine quarter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was dressed
with some distinction; good clothes, when put to the test, survive a
change of fortune, as a Roman arch survives the luxury of departed
empire. Only his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) collar, large V-shaped front, and wristbands, which
bore the ineffaceable signs of cheap laundering, reflected the shadow
of impending disaster.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) glanced sideways, stealthily, at Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), too, was still dressed
with distinction; in the robe of black faille, the cashmere shawl, and
the little black hat with its falling veil, there was no apparent
symptom of beggary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have been judged as one of those women
who content themselves with few clothes but good, and, greatly aided by
nature, make a little go a long way. Good black will last for eternity;
it discloses no secrets of modification and mending, and it is not
transparent.

<p/>At last Gerald, resuming a suspended conversation, said as it were
doggedly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you I haven't got five francs altogether! and you can feel my
pockets if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>added the habitual liar in him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>), fearing
incredulity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what do you expect me to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia inquired.

<p/>The accent, at once ironic and listless, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put this
question, showed that strange and vital things had happened to Sophia
in the four years which had elapsed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marriage. It did really
seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), indeed, that the Sophia whom Gerald had espoused was dead
and gone, and that another Sophia had come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body: so intensely
conscious was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) of a fundamental change in herself under the stress
of continuous experience. And though this was but a seeming, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was still the same Sophia more fully disclosed, it was a true seeming.
Indisputably more beautiful than when Gerald had unwillingly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) legal wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was now nearly twenty-four, and looked perhaps
somewhat older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) age. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) frame was firmly set, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) waist
thicker, neither slim nor stout. The lips were rather hard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
a habit of tightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mouth, on the same provocation as sends a
snail into its shell. No trace was left of immature gawkiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
gestures or of simplicity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) intonations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a woman of
commanding and slightly arrogant charm, not in the least degree the
charm of innocence and ingenuousness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes were the eyes of one who
has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) illusions too violently and too completely. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze,
coldly comprehending, implied familiarity with the abjectness of human
nature. Gerald had begun and had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) education. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had not
ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), as a bad professor may ruin a fine voice, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) moral
force immeasurably exceeded his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) had unwittingly produced a
masterpiece, but it was a tragic masterpiece. Sophia was such a woman
as, by a mere glance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) utters an opinion, will make a man say to
himself, half in desire and half in alarm lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reads him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too: <div class="bookquote">``By
Jove! she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must have been through a thing or two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knows what people
are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The marriage was, of course, a calamitous folly. From the very first,
from the moment when the commercial traveller had with incomparable
rash fatuity thrown the paper pellet over the counter, Sophia's
awakening commonsense had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that in yielding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) instinct she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was sowing misery and shame for herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had gone on, as if
under a spell. It had needed the irretrievableness of flight from home
to begin the breaking of the trance. Once fully awakened out of the
trance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marriage for what it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had made
neither the best nor the worst of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had accepted Gerald as one
accepts a climate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw again and again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was irreclaimably a
fool and a prodigy of irresponsibleness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tolerated him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), now with
sweetness, now bitterly; accepting always his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) caprices, and not
permitting herself to have wishes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was ready to pay the
price of pride and of a moment's imbecility with a lifetime of
self-repression. It was high, but it was the price. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had acquired
nothing but an exceptionally good knowledge of the French language -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
soon learnt to scorn Gerald's glib maltreatment of the tongue-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had conserved nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dignity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that Gerald was sick of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) would have danced for joy to be rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was
constantly unfaithful; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had long since ceased to be excited by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew also that at bottom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was a little afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>);
here was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sole moral consolation. The thing that sometimes struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as surprising was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had not abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), simply and crudely
walked off one day and forgotten to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>).

<p/>They hated each other, but in different ways. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
resented her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I expect you to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) repeated after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you
write home to your people and get some money out of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had said what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with a bullying
swagger. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) been a bigger man he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) might have tried the effect of
physical bullying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) numerous reasons for resenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the taller of the two.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you needn't turn pale and begin all that fuss over again. What I'm
suggesting is a perfectly reasonable thing. If I haven't got money I
haven't got it. I can't invent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was ready for one of their periodical tempestuous
quarrels. But that day she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt too tired and unwell to quarrel. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
warning against a repetition of `fuss' had reference to the gastric
dizziness from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been suffering for two years. It would
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) usually after a meal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not swoon, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head swam and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not stand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would sink down wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) happened to be,
and, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face alarmingly white, murmur faintly: <div class="bookquote">``My salts.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Within five
minutes the attack had gone and left no trace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been through one
just after lunch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) resented this affection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) detested being
compelled to hand the smelling-bottle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) would have avoided
doing so if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pallor did not always alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). Nothing but this
pallor convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) that the attacks were not a deep ruse to impress
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) attitude invariably implied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could cure the malady if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chose, but that through obstinacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not choose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to have the decency to answer my question, or aren't
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What question?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) vibrating voice was low and restrained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you write to your people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sarcasm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone was diabolic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not have kept the
sarcasm out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not attempt to keep it out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cared
little if it whipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) to fury. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) imagine, seriously, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would be capable of going on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knees to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) family? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
unaware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) wife was the proudest and the most obstinate woman on
earth; that all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pride
and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) obstinacy? Ill and weak though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marshalled
together all the forces of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resolve never,
never to eat the bread of humiliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was absolutely determined to
be dead to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family. Certainly, one December, several years
previously, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen English Christmas cards in an English shop in
the Rue de Rivoli, and in a sudden gush of tenderness towards
Constance, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had despatched a coloured greeting to Constance and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mother. And having initiated the custom, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had continued it. That was
not like asking a kindness; it was bestowing a kindness. But except for
the annual card, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dead to St. Luke's Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was one of
those daughters who disappear and are not discussed in the family
circle. The thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) immense foolishness, the little tender
thoughts of Constance, some flitting souvenir, full of unwilling
admiration, of a regal gesture of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother,--these things only
steeled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) against any sort of resurrection after death.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was urging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to write home for money! Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not even
have paid a visit in splendour to St. Luke's Square. Never should they
know what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had suffered! And especially her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Aunt Harriet, from whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had stolen!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you write to your people?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) demanded yet again, emphasizing and
separating each word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said shortly, with terrible disdain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I won't.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The curling line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) lips, as they closed on each
other, said all the rest; all the cruel truths about his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) unspeakable,
inane, coarse follies, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) laziness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) excesses, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) lies, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
deceptions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) bad faith, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) truculence, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) improvidence, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
shameful waste and ruin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) life and hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doubted whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) baseness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wrongs, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) could not read them in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) silent contumely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was too proud to recite them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had
never complained, save in uncontrolled moments of anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's the way you're going to talk--all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) snapped,
furious. Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was baffled.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) kept silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was determined to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would do in the
face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, I'm not joking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``We shall starve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``We shall starve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) surreptitiously, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was almost sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) really
had come to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) tether. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) voice, which never alone
convinced, carried a sort of conviction now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was penniless. In four
years he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had squandered twelve thousand pounds, and had nothing to show
for it except an enfeebled digestion and a tragic figure of a wife. One
small point of satisfaction there was--and all the Baines in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
clutched at it and tried to suck satisfaction from it--their manner of
travelling about from hotel to hotel had made it impossible for Gerald
to run up debts. A few debts he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) might have, unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>), but they
could not be serious.

<p/>So they looked at one another, in hatred and despair. The inevitable
had arrived. For months she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had fronted it in bravado, not concealing
from herself that it lay in waiting. For years he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had been sure that
though the inevitable might happen to others it could not happen to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). There it was! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was conscious of a heavy weight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) stomach,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) of a general numbness, enwrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) fatigue. Even then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
could not believe that it was true, this disaster. As for Sophia she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was reconciling herself with bitter philosophy to the eccentricities of
fate. Who would have dreamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), a young girl brought up, etc?
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother could not have improved the occasion more uncompromisingly
than Sophia did--behind that disdainful mask.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if that's it...!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div>Gerald exploded at length, puffing. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
puffed out of the room and was gone in a second.

<p/>II

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) languidly picked up a book, the moment Gerald had departed, and
tried to prove to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was sufficiently in command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
nerves to read. For a long time reading had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chief solace. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not read. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glanced round the inhospitable chamber, and
thought of the hundreds of rooms--some splendid and some vile, but all
arid in their unwelcoming aspect--through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had passed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
progress from mad exultation to calm and cold disgust. The ceaseless
din of the street annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) jaded ears. And a great wave of desire
for peace, peace of no matter what kind, swept through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And then
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) deep distrust of Gerald reawakened; in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) seriously
desperate air, which had a quality of sincerity quite new in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
experience of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not be entirely sure that, in asserting
utter penury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was not after all merely using a trick to get rid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sprang up, threw the book on the bed, and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gloves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never done
before--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would spy on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). Fighting against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lassitude, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
descended the long winding stairs, and peeped forth from the doorway
into the street. The ground floor of the hotel was a wine-shop; the
stout landlord was lightly flicking one of the three little yellow
tables that stood on the pavement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) smiled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) customary
benevolence, and silently pointed in the direction of the Rue Notre
Dame de Lorette. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw Gerald down there in the distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was
smoking a cigar.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) seemed to be a little man without a care. The smoke of the cigar
came first round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) left cheek and then round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) right, sailing away
into nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) walked with a gay spring, but not quickly, flourishing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) cane as freely as the traffic of the pavement would permit,
glancing into all the shop windows and into the eyes of all the women
under forty. This was not at all the same man as had a moment ago been
spitting angry menaces at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) in the bedroom of the hotel. It was a
fellow of blithe charm, ripe for any adventurous joys that destiny had
to offer.

<p/>Supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned round and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)?

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned round and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was doing there
in the street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) plainly: <div class="bookquote">``I'm following you, to find
out what you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went straight forward, deviating at the church,
where the crowd became thicker, into the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre,
and so to the boulevard, which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) crossed. The whole city seemed
excited and vivacious. Cannons boomed in slow succession, and flags
were flying. Sophia had no conception of the significance of those
guns, for, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) read a great deal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) never read a newspaper;
the idea of opening a newspaper never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
accustomed to the feverish atmosphere of Paris. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had lately seen
regiments of cavalry flashing and prancing in the Luxembourg Gardens,
and had much admired the fine picture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) accepted the booming as
another expression of the high spirits that had to find vent somehow in
this feverish empire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) so accepted it and forgot it, using all the
panorama of the capital as a dim background for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exacerbated egoism.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was obliged to walk slowly, because Gerald walked slowly. A
beautiful woman, or any woman not positively hag-like or venerable, who
walks slowly in the streets of Paris becomes at once the cause of
inconvenient desires, as representing the main objective on earth,
always transcending in importance politics and affairs. Just as a true
patriotic Englishman cannot be too busy to run after a fox, so a
Frenchman is always ready to forsake all in order to follow a woman
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) has never before set eyes on. Many men thought twice about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) romantic Saxon mystery of temperament, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Parisian
clothes; but all refrained from affronting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), not in the least out of
respect for the gloom in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, but from an expert conviction that
those rapt eyes were fixed immovably on another male. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked
unscathed amid the frothing hounds as though protected by a spell.

<p/>On the south side of the boulevard, Gerald proceeded down the Rue
Montmartre, and then turned suddenly into the Rue Croissant. Sophia
stopped and asked the price of some combs which were exposed outside a
little shop. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went on, boldly passing the end of the Rue
Croissant. No shadow of Gerald! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw the signs of newspapers all
along the street, Le Bien Public, La Presse Libre, La Patrie. There was
a creamery at the corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) entered it, asked for a cup of chocolate
and sat down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to drink coffee, but every doctor had
forbidden coffee to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attacks of dizziness. Then,
having ordered chocolate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that, on this occasion, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
need of strength in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) great fatigue, only coffee could suffice her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) changed the order. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was close to the door, and Gerald could
not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) vigilance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) emerged at that end of the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
drank the coffee with greedy satisfaction, and waited in the creamery
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began to feel conspicuous there. And then Gerald went by the
door, within six feet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) turned the corner and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
descent of the Rue Montmartre. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) coffee and followed the
chase. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blood seemed to be up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips were tightened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thought was: <div class="bookquote">``Wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) goes, I'll go, and I don't care what
happens.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt herself above him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that
somehow, since quitting the hotel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had been gradually growing more
and more vile and meet to be exterminated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) imagined infamies as to
the Rue Croissant. There was no obvious ground for this intensifying of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attitude towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>); it was merely the result of the chase. All
that could be definitely charged against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was the smoking of a cigar.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) stepped into a tobacco-shop, and came out with a longer cigar than
the first one, a more expensive article, stripped off its collar and
lighted it as a millionaire might have lighted it. This was the man who
swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not possess five francs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tracked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as far as the Rue de Rivoli, and then lost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There
were vast surging crowds in the Rue de Rivoli, and much bunting, and
soldiers and gesticulatory policemen. The general effect of the street
was that all things were brightly waving in the breeze. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was caught
in the crowd as in the current of a stream, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried to sidle
out of it into a square, a row of smiling policemen barred her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) passage;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a part of the traffic that they had to regulate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) drifted
till the Louvre came into view. After all, Gerald had only strolled
forth to see the sight of the day, whatever it might be! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew not
what it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no curiosity about it. In the middle of all that
thickening mass of humanity, staring with one accord at the vast
monument of royal and imperial vanities, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
characteristic grimness, of the sacrifice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) whole career as a
school-teacher for the chance of seeing Gerald once a quarter in the
shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gloated over that, as a sick appetite will gloat over tainted
food. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw the shop, and the curve of the stairs up to the
showroom, and the pier-glass in the showroom.

<p/>Then the guns began to boom again, and splendid carriages swept one
after another from under a majestic archway and glittered westward down
a lane of spotless splendid uniforms. The carriages were laden with
still more splendid uniforms, and with enchanting toilets. Sophia, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) modestly stylish black, mechanically noticed how much easier it was
for attired women to sit in a carriage now that crinolines had gone.
That was the sole impression made upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) by this glimpse of the last
fete of the Napoleonic Empire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew not that the supreme pillars of
imperialism were exhibiting themselves before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); and that the eyes of
those uniforms and those toilettes were full of the legendary beauty of
Eugenie, and their ears echoing to the long phrases of Napoleon the
Third about his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) gratitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) people for their confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) as
shown by the plebiscite, and about the ratification of constitutional
reforms guaranteeing order, and about the empire having been
strengthened at its base, and about showing force by moderation and
envisaging the future without fear, and about the bosom of peace and
liberty, and the eternal continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) dynasty.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>) just wondered vaguely what was afoot.

<p/>When the last carriage had rolled away, and the guns and acclamations
had ceased, the crowd at length began to scatter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>) was carried by it
into the Place du Palais Royal, and in a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>) managed to
withdraw into the Rue des Bons Enfants and was free.

<p/>The coins in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>) purse amounted to three sous, and therefore, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>) felt exhausted to the point of illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>) had to return to the
hotel on foot. Very slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>) crawled upwards in the direction of the
Boulevard, through the expiring gaiety of the city. Near the Bourse a
fiacre overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenie</b></font>), and in the fiacre were Gerald and a woman. Gerald
had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was talking eagerly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) ornate companion. All
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) body was alive. The fiacre was out of sight in a moment, but Sophia
judged instantly the grade of the woman, who was evidently of the
discreet class that frequented the big shops of an afternoon with
something of their own to sell.

<p/>Sophia's grimness increased. The pace of the fiacre, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fatigued body,
Gerald's delightful, careless vivacity, the attractive streaming veil
of the nice, modest courtesan--everything conspired to increase it.

<p/>III

<p/>Gerald returned to the bedroom which contained his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) wife and all else
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) owned in the world at about nine o'clock that evening. Sophia
was in bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been driven to bed by weariness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have
preferred to sit up to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) husband, even if it had meant
sitting up all night, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body was too heavy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spirit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
lay in the dark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had eaten nothing. Gerald came straight into the
room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) struck a match, which burned blue, with a stench, for several
seconds, and then gave a clear, yellow flame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) lit a candle; and saw
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you're there, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) offered no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't speak, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Agreeable sort of wife! Well, have you
made up your mind to do what I told you? I've come back especially to
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) still did not speak.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) sat down, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) hat on, and stuck out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) feet, wagging them to
and fro on the heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite without money,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm sure your people will
be glad to lend us a bit till I get some. Especially as it's a question
of you starving as well as me. If I had enough to pay your fares to
Bursley I'd pack you off. But I haven't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could only hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) exasperating voice. The end of the bed was
between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, with uncompromising distinctness. The word reached
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) barbed with all the poison of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) contempt and disgust.

<p/>There was a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I'm a liar, am I? Thanks. I lied enough to get you, I'll admit.
But you never complained of that. I remember be-ginning the New Year
well with a thumping lie just to have a sight of you, my vixen. But you
didn't complain then. I took you with only the clothes on your back.
And I've spent every cent I had on you. And now I'm spun, you call me a
liar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``this is going to come to an end, this is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) rose, changed the position of the candle, putting it on a chest of
drawers, and then drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) trunk from the wall, and knelt in front of
it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gathered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was packing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) clothes. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not
comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) reference to beginning the New Year. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) meaning
revealed itself. That story to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother about having been attacked by
ruffians at the bottom of King Street had been an invention, a ruse to
account plausibly for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) presence on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother's doorstep! And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had never suspected that the story was not true. In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lying, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had never suspected that that particular
statement was a lie. What a simpleton she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was!

<p/>There was a continual movement in the room for about a quarter of an
hour. Then a key turned in the lock of the trunk.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head popped up over the foot of the bed. <div class="bookquote">``This isn't a joke, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kept silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I give you one more chance. Will you write to your mother--or
Constance if you like--or won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) scorned to reply in any way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm your husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And it's your duty to obey me,
particularly in an affair like this. I order you to write to your
mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips turned downwards.

<p/>Angered by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mute obstinacy, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) broke away from the bed with a sudden
gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do as you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cried, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) overcoat, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall
do as I like. You can't say I haven't warned you. It's your own
deliberate choice, mind you! Whatever happens to you you've brought on
yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lifted and shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shoulders to get the overcoat
exactly into place on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not speak a word, not even to insist that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was indisposed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) trunk outside the door, and returned to the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said menacingly; <div class="bookquote">``I'm off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked up at the foul ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sniffed, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) reserves of pride to combat the
persistent silence that was damaging his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) dignity. And he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) went off,
sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head forward like a pugilist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``You're forgetting this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) turned.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand to the night-table and held up a red circlet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the bit of paper off the cigar you bought in the Rue Montmartre
this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered, in a significant tone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hesitated, then swore violently, and bounced out of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) suffer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was almost repaid for everything by that
moment of cruel triumph. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) exulted in it, and never forgot it.

<p/>Five minutes later, the gloomy menial in felt slippers and alpaca
jacket, who seemed to pass the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) life flitting in and out of
bedrooms like a rabbit in a warren, carried Gerald's trunk downstairs.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) recognized the peculiar tread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) slippers.

<p/>Then there was a knock at the door. The landlady entered, actuated by a
legitimate curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame is suffering?''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>the landlady began.

<p/>Sophia refused offers of food and nursing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame knows without doubt that monsieur has gone away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) paid the bill?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But yes, madame, till to-morrow. Then madame has want of nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will extinguish the candle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), then!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reflected, listening in the dark to the ceaseless
rattle of the street, <div class="bookquote">``because mother and Constance wanted to see the
elephant, and I had to go into father's room! I should never have
caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from the drawing-room window!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>IV

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) passed a night of physical misery, exasperated by the tireless
rattling vitality of the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kept saying to herself: <div class="bookquote">``I'm all
alone now, and I'm going to be ill. I am ill.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw herself dying in
Paris, and heard the expressions of facile sympathy and idle curiosity
drawn forth by the sight of the dead body of this foreign woman in a
little Paris hotel. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reached the stage, in the gradual excruciation
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nerves, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was obliged to concentrate her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) agonized mind on
an intense and painful expectancy of the next new noise, which when it
came increased her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) torture and decreased her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strength to support it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went through all the interminable dilatoriness of the dawn, from
the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could scarcely discern the window to the moment
when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could read the word ``Bock' on the red circlet of paper which
had tossed all night on the sea of the counterpane. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
never sleep again. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not imagine herself asleep; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was startled by a sound that seemed to clash with the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
impressions. It was a knocking at the door. With a start she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) perceived
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must have been asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>There entered the menial in alpaca. His (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waxen face showed a morose
commiseration. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) noiselessly approached the bed--he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to have
none of the characteristics of a man, but to be a creature infinitely
mysterious and aloof from humanity--and held out to Sophia a visiting
card in his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grey hand.

<p/>It was Chirac's card.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur asked for monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>said the waiter. <div class="bookquote">``And then, as monsieur
had gone away he (<font color='blue'><b>Bock</b></font>) demanded to see madame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bock</b></font>) says it is very important.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart jumped, partly in vague alarm, and partly with a sense of
relief at this chance of speaking to some one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried
to reflect rationally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eleven o'clock, madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was surprising. The fact that it was eleven o'clock destroyed the
remains of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) self-confidence. How could it be eleven o'clock, with
the dawn scarcely finished?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bock</b></font>) says it is very important,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>repeated the waiter, imperturbably and
solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``Will madame see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bock</b></font>) an instant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Between resignation and anticipation she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>said the waiter, disappearing without a sound.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat up and managed to drag her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) matinee from a chair and put it
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shoulders. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sank back from weakness, physical and
spiritual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hated to receive Chirac in a bedroom, and particularly
in that bedroom. But the hotel had no public room except the
dining-room, which began to be occupied after eleven o'clock. Moreover,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not possibly get up. Yes, on the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was pleased to see
Chirac. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was almost her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) only acquaintance, assuredly the only being
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could by any stretch of meaning call a friend, in the whole of
Europe. Gerald and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had wandered to and fro, skimming always over
the real life of nations, and never penetrating into it. There was no
place for them, because they had made none. With the exception of
Chirac, whom an accident of business had thrown, into Gerald's company
years before, they had no social relations. Gerald was not a man to
make friends; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) did not seem to need friends, or at any rate to feel
the want of them. But, as chance had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) Chirac, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) maintained
the connection whenever they came to Paris. Sophia, of course, had not
been able to escape from the solitude imposed by existence in hotels.
Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never spoken to a woman in the way of
intimacy. But once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had approached intimacy with Chirac,
whose wistful admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) always aroused into activity her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
desire to charm.

<p/>Preceded by the menial, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) came into the room hurriedly,
apologetically, with an air of acute anxiety. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lying
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) back, with flushed features, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair disarranged, and only the
grace of the silk ribbons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) matinee to mitigate the melancholy
repulsiveness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) surroundings, that anxiety seemed to deepen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) stammered, <div class="bookquote">``all my excuses!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hastened to the
bedside and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand--a little peek according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) custom.
<div class="bookquote">``You are ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have my migraine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You want Gerald?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said diffidently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had promised--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) has left me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) weak and fatigued
voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) uttered the words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Left you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) glanced round to be sure that the waiter had retired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quitted me! Abandoned me! Last night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not possible!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) breathed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nodded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>). Like all secretive persons, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could be suddenly expansive at times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) questioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All that is most serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you ill! Ah, the wretch! Ah, the wretch! That, for example!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
waved his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) hat about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you want, Chirac?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demanded, in a confidential tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac. <div class="bookquote">``You do not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) has gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) insisted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was nervous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) fidgetted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) guessed that, though warm with
sympathy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) plight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was preoccupied by interests and
apprehensions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) did not refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) request temporarily to
leave the astonishing matter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) situation in order to discuss the
matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well! He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) came to me yesterday afternoon in the Rue Croissant to
borrow some money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) understood then the object of Gerald's stroll on the previous
afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you didn't lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) any,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well! It was like this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) ought to have received five
thousand francs yesterday morning, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had had a telegram that
it would not arrive till to-day. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had need of five hundred francs
at once. I had not five hundred francs'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) smiled sadly, as if to
insinuate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) did not handle such sums--<div class="bookquote">``but I borrowed it from
the cashbox of the journal. It is necessary, absolutely, that I should
return it this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) spoke with increased seriousness. <div class="bookquote">``Your
husband said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would take a cab and bring me the money immediately on
the arrival of the post this morning--about nine o'clock. Pardon me for
deranging you with such a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) stopped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) really was grieved to `derange' her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
but that circumstances pressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At my paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``it is not so easy as that to--in fine--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerald had genuinely been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) last francs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had not lied when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had lied. The nakedness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) character showed now.
Instantly upon the final and definite cessation of the lawful supply of
money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) wits to obtain money unlawfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had, in fact,
simply stolen it from Chirac, with the ornamental addition of
endangering Chirac's reputation and situation--as a sort of reward to
Chirac for the kindness! And, further, no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) got hold of the
money than it had intoxicated him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had yielded to the first
fatuous temptation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had no sense of responsibility, no scruple. And
as for common prudence--had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) not risked permanent disgrace and even
prison for a paltry sum which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) would certainly squander in two or
three days? Yes, it was indubitable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) would stop at nothing, at
nothing whatever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was coming to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>asked Chirac, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
short, silky brown beard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said that you had charged him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with your friendlinesses to me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) head once or twice, sadly but candidly accepting, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
quality of a Latin, the plain facts of human nature--reconciling
himself to them at once.

<p/>Sophia revolted at this crowning detail of the structure of Gerald's
rascality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is fortunate that I can pay you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) tried to protest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have quite enough money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not say this to screen Gerald, but merely from amour-propre.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not let Chirac think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the wife of a man bereft of
all honour. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) clothed Gerald with the rag of having, at any
rate, not left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in destitution as well as in sickness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) assertion
seemed a strange one, in view of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) on
the previous evening--that is to say, immediately after the borrowing
from Chirac. But Chirac did not examine the statement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has the intention to send me the money. Perhaps, after all,
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is now at the offices--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is gone. Will you go downstairs and wait for me.
We will go together to Cook's office. It is English money I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cook's?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) repeated. The word now so potent had then little
significance. <div class="bookquote">``But you are ill. You cannot--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did. Or rather, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt nothing except the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) resolve to
remove the painful anxiety from that wistful brow. The shame of the
trick played on Chirac awakened new forces in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dressed in a
physical torment which, however, had no more reality than a nightmare.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) searched in a place where even an inquisitive husband would not
think of looking, and then, painfully, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) descended the long stairs,
holding to the rail, which swam round and round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), carrying the whole
staircase with it. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I can't be seriously ill,
or I shouldn't have been able to get up and go out like this. I never
guessed early this morning that I could do it! I can't possibly be as
ill as I thought I was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And in the vestibule she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) encountered Chirac's face, lightening at the
sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), which proved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) deliverance was really to be
accomplished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Permit me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled, tottering. <div class="bookquote">``Get a cab.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It suddenly
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might quite as easily have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) the money
in English notes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could have changed them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not thought.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brain would not operate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was dreaming and waking together.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into the cab.

<p/>V

<p/>In the bureau de change there was a little knot of English, people,
with naive, romantic, and honest faces, quite different from the faces
outside in the street. No corruption in those faces, but a sort of
wondering and infantile sincerity, rather out of its element and lost
in a land too unsophisticated, seeming to belong to an earlier age!
Sophia liked their tourist stare, and their plain and ugly clothes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
longed to be back in England, longed for a moment with violence,
drowning in that desire.

<p/>The English clerk behind his (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) brass bars took her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) notes, and carefully
examined them one by one. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>), not entirely convinced of
his (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) reality, and thought vaguely of the detestable morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had
abstracted the notes from Gerald's pocket. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was filled with pity for
the simple, ignorant Sophia of those days, the Sophia who still had a
few ridiculous illusions concerning Gerald's character. Often, since,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been tempted to break into the money, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had always
withstood the temptation, saying to herself that an hour of more urgent
need would come. It had come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) firmness, of the
force of will which had enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to reserve the fund intact. The
clerk gave her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) a keen look, and then asked her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) would take the
French money. And she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) saw the notes falling down one after another on
to the counter as the clerk separated them with a snapping sound of the
paper.

<p/>Chirac was beside her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does that make the count?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) said, having pushed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) five
hundred-franc notes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not know how to thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said, accepting the notes.
<div class="bookquote">``Truly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) joy was unmistakably eager. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had had a shock and a fright, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
now saw the danger past. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could return to the cashier of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
newspaper, and fling down the money with a lordly and careless air, as
if to say: <div class="bookquote">``When it is a question of these English, one can always be
sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>the cashier</b></font>)</div>But first he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) would escort her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) to the hotel. She (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) declined--she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>)
did not know why, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) sole point of moral support in all
France. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) insisted. She (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) yielded. So she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) back, with regret,
on that little English oasis in the Sahara of Paris, and staggered to
the fiacre.

<p/>And now that she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) had done what she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) had to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) lost control of her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>)
body, and reclined flaccid and inert. Chirac was evidently alarmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
did not speak, but glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) from time to time with eyes full of
fear. The carriage appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) to be swimming amid waves over great
depths. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) was aware of a heavy weight against her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) shoulder; she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>)
had slipped down upon Chirac, unconscious.




<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>FEVER

<p/>I


<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) was lying in bed in a small room, obscure because it was
heavily curtained; the light came through the inner pair of curtains of
ecru lace, with a beautiful soft silvery quality. A man was standing by
the side of the bed--not Chirac.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>), with kind firmness, and speaking with a
charming exaggerated purity of the vowels. <div class="bookquote">``You have the mucous fever.
I have had it myself. You will be forced to take baths, very
frequently. I must ask you to reconcile yourself to that, to be good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) did not reply. It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) to reply. But she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) certainly
thought that this doctor--he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was probably a doctor--was overestimating
her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) case. She (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) felt better than she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) had felt for two days. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>)
did not desire to move, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) in the least anxious as to her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>)
surroundings. She (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) lay quiet.

<p/>A woman in a rather coquettish deshabille watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) with expert
skill.

<p/>Later, Sophia seemed to be revisiting the sea on whose waves the cab
had swum; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was under the sea, in a watery gulf, terribly
deep; and the sounds of the world came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) through the water, sudden
and strange. Hands seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from the subaqueous grotto
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had hidden into new alarms. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) briefly perceived that
there was a large bath by the side of the bed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was being
pushed into it. The water was icy cold. After that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) outlook upon
things was for a time clearer and more precise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew from fragments
of talk which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was put into the cold bath by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bed
every three hours, night and day, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remained in it for ten
minutes. Always, before the bath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had to drink a glass of wine, and
sometimes another glass while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in the bath. Beyond this wine,
and occasionally a cup of soup, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) took nothing, had no wish to take
anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grew perfectly accustomed to these extraordinary habits
of life, to this merging of night and day into one monotonous and
endless repetition of the same rite amid the same circumstances on
exactly the same spot. Then followed a period during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) objected
to being constantly wakened up for this annoying immersion. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
fought against it even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dreams. Long days seemed to pass when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could not be sure whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been put into the bath or not, when
all external phenomena were disconcertingly interwoven with matters
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew to be merely fanciful. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was overwhelmed by
the hopeless gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) state. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) state was
desperate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was dying. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) unhappiness was extreme,
not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was dying, but because the veils of sense were so
puzzling, so exasperating, and because her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exhausted body was so
vitiated, in every fibre, by disease. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was perfectly aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was going to die. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cried aloud for a pair of scissors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to
cut off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair, and to send part of it to Constance and part of it to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother, in separate packages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) insisted upon separate packages.
Nobody would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a pair of scissors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) implored, meekly,
haughtily, furiously, but nobody would satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
shocking that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair should go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) coffin while
Constance and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother had nothing by which to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), no
tangible souvenir of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fought for the scissors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
clutched at some one--always through those baffling veils--who was
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into the bath by the bedside, and fought frantically. It
appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that this some one was the rather stout woman who had
supped at Sylvain's with the quarrelsome Englishman, four years ago.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not rid herself of this singular conceit, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew it
to be absurd...

<p/>A long time afterwards--it seemed like a century--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did actually and
unmistakably see the woman sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bed, and the woman was crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you crying?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked wonderingly.

<p/>And the other, younger, woman, who was standing at the foot of the bed,
replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do well to ask! It is you who have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), in your delirium,
when you so madly demanded the scissors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The stout woman smiled with the tears on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks; but Sophia wept,
from remorse. The stout woman looked old, worn, and untidy. The other
one was much younger. Sophia did not trouble to inquire from them who
they were.

<p/>That little conversation formed a brief interlude in the delirium,
which overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again and distorted everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) forgot, however,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was destined to die.

<p/>One day her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brain cleared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could be sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had gone to sleep
in the morning and not wakened till the evening. Hence she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not been
put into the bath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I had my baths?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) questioned.

<p/>It was the doctor who faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the baths are finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was out of danger. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
conscious of a new feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body, as though the fount of physical
energy within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), long interrupted, had recommenced to flow--but very
slowly, a trickling. It was a rebirth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not glad, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body
itself was glad; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body had an existence of its own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was now often left by herself in the bedroom. To the right of the
foot of the bed was a piano in walnut, and to the left a chimney-piece
with a large mirror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to look at herself in the mirror. But
it was a very long way off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried to sit up, and could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
hoped that one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would be able to get as far as the mirror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
said not a word about this to either of the two women.

<p/>Often they would sit in the bedroom and talk without ceasing. Sophia
learnt that the stout woman was named Foucault, and the other Laurence.
Sometimes Laurence would address Madame Foucault as Aimee, but usually
she (<font color='blue'><b>Aimee</b></font>) was more formal. Madame Foucault always called the other Laurence.

<p/>Sophia's curiosity stirred and awoke. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not obtain any very
exact information as to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, except that the house was in the
Rue Breda, off the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recollected vaguely
that the reputation of the street was sinister. It appeared that, on
the day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had gone out with Chirac, the upper part of the Rue
Notre Dame de Lorette was closed for repairs---LRB-this she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
remembered-RRB---and that the cabman had turned up the Rue Breda in order
to make a detour, and that it was just opposite to the house of Madame
Foucault that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had lost consciousness. Madame Foucault happened to
be getting into a cab at the moment; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had told Chirac
nevertheless to carry Sophia into the house, and a policeman had
helped. Then, when the doctor came, it was discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
not be moved, save to a hospital, and both Madame Foucault and Laurence
were determined that no friend of Chirac's should be committed to the
horrors of a Paris hospital. Madame Foucault had suffered in one as a
patient, and Laurence had been a nurse in another...

<p/>Chirac was now away. The women talked loosely of a war.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind you have been!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Sophia, with humid eyes.

<p/>But they silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with gestures. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not to talk. They seemed
to have nothing further to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). They said Chirac would be
returning perhaps soon, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). Evidently they
both held Chirac in affection. They said often that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was a charming
boy.

<p/>Bit by bit Sophia comprehended the length and the seriousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
illness, and the immense devotion of the two women, and the terrific
disturbance of their lives, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own debility. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that the
women were strongly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not understand why,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never done anything for them, whereas they had done
everything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not learnt that benefits rendered, not
benefits received, are the cause of such attachments.

<p/>All the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was plotting, and gathering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) strength to disobey
orders and get as far as the mirror. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) preliminary studies and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
preparations were as elaborate as those of a prisoner arranging to
escape from a fortress. The first attempt was a failure. The second
succeeded. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not stand without support, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) managed by
clinging to the bed to reach a chair, and to push the chair in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) until it approached the mirror. The enterprise was exciting and
terrific. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw a face in the glass: white, incredibly
emaciated, with great, wild, staring eyes; and the shoulders were bent
as though with age. It was a painful, almost a horrible sight. It
frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), so that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) alarm she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recoiled from it. Not
attending sufficiently to the chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sank to the ground. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
not pick herself up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was caught there, miserably, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
angered jailers. The vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) more efficiently
than anything else the gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) adventure. As the women lifted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) inert, repentant mass into the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reflected, <div class="bookquote">``How queer my
life is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to have been trimming hats in
the showroom instead of being in that curtained, mysterious, Parisian
interior.

<p/>II

<p/>One day Madame Foucault knocked at the door of Sophia's little room
-LRB-this ceremony of knocking was one of the indications that Sophia,
convalescent, had been reinstated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rights as an individual-RRB-, and
cried:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame, one is going to leave you all alone for some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia convalescent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, who was sitting up in an armchair, and reading.

<p/>Madame Foucault opened the door. <div class="bookquote">``One is going to leave you all alone
for some time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) repeated in a low, confidential voice, sharply
contrasting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shriek behind the door.

<p/>Sophia nodded and smiled, and Madame Foucault also nodded and smiled.
But Madame Foucault's face quickly resumed its anxious expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The servant's brother marries himself to-day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) implored me to
accord her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) two days--what would you? Madame Laurence is out. And I must
go out. It is four o'clock. I shall re-enter at six o'clock striking.
Therefore ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia concurred.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked curiously at Madame Foucault, who was carefully made up and
arranged for the street, in a dress of yellow tussore with blue
ornaments, bright lemon-coloured gloves, a little blue bonnet, and a
little white parasol not wider when opened than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shoulders. Cheeks,
lips, and eyes were heavily charged with rouge, powder, or black. And
that too abundant waist had been most cunningly confined in a belt that
descended beneath, instead of rising above, the lower masses of the
vast torso. The general effect was worthy of the effort that must have
gone to it. Madame Foucault was not rejuvenated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) toilette, but it
almost procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pardon for the crime of being over forty, fat,
creased, and worn out. It was one of those defeats that are a triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very chic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, uttering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>said Madame Foucault, shrugging the shoulders of disillusion.
<div class="bookquote">``Chic! What does that do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was pleased.

<p/>The front-door banged. Sophia, by herself for the first time in the
flat into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been carried unconscious and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
never since left, had the disturbing sensation of being surrounded by
mysterious rooms and mysterious things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried to continue reading,
but the sentences conveyed nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rose--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could walk now
a little--and looked out of the window, through the interstices of the
pattern of the lace curtains. The window gave on the courtyard, which
was about sixteen feet below her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). A low wall divided the courtyard from
that of the next house. And the windows of the two houses, only to be
distinguished by the different tints of their yellow paint, rose tier
above tier in level floors, continuing beyond Sophia's field of vision.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face against the glass, and remembered the St. Luke's
Square of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) childhood; and just as there from the showroom window she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could not even by pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face against the glass see the pavement,
so here she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not see the roof; the courtyard was like the bottom
of a well. There was no end to the windows; six storeys she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
count, and the sills of a seventh were the limit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) view. Every
window was heavily curtained, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own. Some of the upper ones had
green sunblinds. Scarcely any sound! Mysteries brooded without as well
as within the flat of Madame Foucault. Sophia saw a bodiless hand
twitch at a curtain and vanish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) noticed a green bird in a tiny cage
on a sill in the next house. A woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took to be the concierge
appeared in the courtyard, deposited a small plant in the track of a
ray of sunshine that lighted a corner for a couple of hours in the
afternoon, and disappeared again. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard a piano--somewhere.
That was all. The feeling that secret and strange lives were being
lived behind those baffling windows, that humanity was everywhere
intimately pulsing around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spirit yet not quite
unpleasantly. The environment softened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glance upon the spectacle of
existence, insomuch that sadness became a voluptuous pleasure. And the
environment threw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back on herself, into a sensuous contemplation of
the fundamental fact of Sophia Scales, formerly Sophia Baines.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned to the room, with the marks of the bath on the floor by the
bed, and the draped piano that was never opened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two trunks
filling up the corner opposite the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the idea of thoroughly
examining those trunks, which Chirac or somebody else must have fetched
from the hotel. At the top of one of them was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purse, tied up with
old ribbon and ostentatiously sealed! How comical these French people
were when they deemed it necessary to be serious! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) emptied both
trunks, scrutinizing minutely all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goods, and thinking of the varied
occasions upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had obtained them. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carefully restored
them, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind full of souvenirs newly awakened.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) straightened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back. A clock struck in another
room. It seemed to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) towards discoveries. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been in no
other room of the flat. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew nothing of the rest of the flat save
by sound. For neither of the other women had ever described it, nor had
it occurred to them that Sophia might care to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) room though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could not leave the house.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door, and glanced along the dim corridor, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was familiar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that the kitchen lay next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) little room,
and that next to the kitchen came the front-door. On the opposite side
of the corridor were four double-doors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) crossed to the pair of
doors facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own little door, and quietly turned the handle, but
the doors were locked; the same with the next pair. The third pair
yielded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in a large bedroom, with three windows on the
street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that the second pair of doors, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had failed to
unfasten, also opened into this room. Between the two pairs of doors
was a wide bed. In front of the central window was a large
dressing-table. To the left of the bed, half hiding the locked doors,
was a large screen. On the marble mantelpiece, reflected in a huge
mirror, that ascended to the ornate cornice, was a gilt-and-basalt
clock, with pendants to match. On the opposite side of the room from
this was a long wide couch. The floor was of polished oak, with a skin
on either side of the bed. At the foot of the bed was a small
writing-table, with a penny bottle of ink on it. A few coloured prints
and engravings--representing, for example, Louis Philippe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philippe</b></font>)
family, and people perishing on a raft--broke the tedium of the walls.
The first impression on Sophia's eye was one of sombre splendour.
Everything had the air of being richly ornamented, draped, looped,
carved, twisted, brocaded into gorgeousness. The dark crimson
bed-hangings fell from massive rosettes in majestic folds. The
counterpane was covered with lace. The window-curtains had amplitude
beyond the necessary, and they were suspended from behind fringed and
pleated valances. The green sofa and its sateen cushions were stiff
with applied embroidery. The chandelier hanging from the middle of the
ceiling, modelled to represent cupids holding festoons, was a
glittering confusion of gilt and lustres; the lustres tinkled when
Sophia stood on a certain part of the floor. The cane-seated chairs
were completely gilded. There was an effect of spaciousness. And the
situation of the bed between the two double-doors, with the three
windows in front and other pairs of doors communicating with other
rooms on either hand, produced in addition an admirable symmetry.

<p/>But Sophia, with the sharp gaze of a woman brought up in the traditions
of a modesty so proud that it scorns ostentation, quickly tested and
condemned the details of this chamber that imitated every luxury.
Nothing in it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found, was <div class="bookquote">``good.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in St. Luke's Square
`goodness' meant honest workmanship, permanence, the absence of
pretence. All the stuffs were cheap and showy and shabby; all the
furniture was cracked, warped, or broken. The clock showed five minutes
past twelve at five o'clock. And further, dust was everywhere, except
in those places where even the most perfunctory cleaning could not have
left it. In the obscurer pleatings of draperies it lay thick. Sophia's
lip curled, and instinctively she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) peignoir. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mother's phrases came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head: 'a lick and a promise.'' And then
another: <div class="bookquote">``If you want to leave dirt, leave it where everybody can see
it, not in the corners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) peeped behind the screen, and all the horrible welter of a cabinet
de toilette met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze: a repulsive medley of foul waters, stained
vessels and cloths, brushes, sponges, powders, and pastes. Clothes were
hung up in disorder on rough nails; among them she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recognized a
dressing-gown of Madame Foucault's, and, behind affairs of later date,
the dazzling scarlet cloak in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had first seen Madame Foucault,
dilapidated now. So this was Madame Foucault's room! This was the bower
from which that elegance emerged, the filth from which had sprung the
mature blossom!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) passed from that room direct to another, of which the shutters were
closed, leaving it in twilight. This room too was a bedroom, rather
smaller than the middle one, and having only one window, but furnished
with the same dubious opulence. Dust covered it everywhere, and small
footmarks were visible in the dust on the floor. At the back was a
small door, papered to match the wall, and within this door was a
cabinet de toilette, with no light and no air; neither in the room nor
in the closet was there any sign of individual habitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
traversed the main bedroom again and found another bedroom to balance
the second one, but open to the full light of day, and in a state of
extreme disorder; the double-pillowed bed had not even been made:
clothes and towels draped all the furniture: shoes were about the
floor, and on a piece of string tied across the windows hung a single
white stocking, wet. At the back was a cabinet de toilette, as dark as
the other one, a vile malodorous mess of appliances whose familiar
forms loomed vague and extraordinarily sinister in the dense obscurity.
Sophia turned away with the righteous disgust of one whose preparations
for the gaze of the world are as candid and simple as those of a child.
Concealed dirt shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as much as it would have shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother;
and as for the trickeries of the toilet table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) contemned them as
harshly as a young saint who has never been tempted contemns moral
weakness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought of the strange flaccid daily life of those two
women, whose hours seemed to slip unprofitably away without any result
of achievement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had actually witnessed nothing; but since the
beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) convalescence her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ears had heard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could piece
the evidences together. There was never any sound in the flat, outside
the kitchen, until noon. Then vague noises and smells would commence.
And about one o'clock Madame Foucault, disarrayed, would come to
inquire if the servant had attended to the needs of the invalid. Then
the odours of cookery would accentuate themselves; bells rang;
fragments of conversations escaped through doors ajar; occasionally a
man's voice or a heavy step; then the fragrance of coffee; sometimes
the sound of a kiss, the banging of the front door, the noise of
brushing, or of the shaking of a carpet, a little scream as at some
trifling domestic contretemps. Laurence, still in a dressing-gown,
would lounge into Sophia's room, dirty, haggard, but polite with a
curious stiff ceremony, and would drink her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) coffee there. This
wandering in peignoirs would continue till three o'clock, and then
Laurence might say, as if nerving herself to an unusual and immense
effort: <div class="bookquote">``I must be dressed by five o'clock. I have not a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>Often
Madame Foucault did not dress at all; on such days she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would go to bed
immediately after dinner, with the remark that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) didn't know what was
the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was exhausted. And then the servant would
retire to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seventh floor, and there would be silence until, now and
then, faint creepings were heard at midnight or after. Once or twice,
through the chinks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door, Sophia had seen a light at two o'clock
in the morning, just before the dawn.

<p/>Yet these were the women who had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life, who between them had
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into a cold bath every three hours night and day for weeks!
Surely it was impossible after that to despise them for shiftlessness
and talkative idling in peignoirs; impossible to despise them for
anything whatever! But Sophia, conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) inheritance of strong
and resolute character, did despise them as poor things. The one point
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) envied them was their formal manners to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), which seemed
to become more dignified and graciously distant as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) health improved.
It was always <div class="bookquote">``Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), with an intonation of
increasing deference. They might have been apologizing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) for
themselves.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) prowled into all the corners of the flat; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) discovered no
more rooms, nothing but a large cupboard crammed with Madame Foucault's
dresses. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went back to the large bedroom, and enjoyed the busy
movement and rattle of the sloping street, and had long, vague
yearnings for strength and for freedom in wide, sane places. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
decided that on the morrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would dress herself <div class="bookquote">``properly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
never again wear a peignoir; the peignoir and all that it represented,
disgusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And while looking at the street she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ceased to see it and
saw Cook's office and Chirac helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into the carriage. Where was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to this impossible abode? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) mean
by such conduct? But could he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) have acted otherwise? He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had done the one
thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could do... Chance! ... Chance! And why an impossible
abode? Was one place more impossible than another? All this came of
running away from home with Gerald. It was remarkable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seldom
thought of Gerald. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had come into
it--madly, preposterously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered what the next stage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
career would be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) certainly could not forecast it. Perhaps Gerald
was starving, or in prison ... Bah! That exclamation expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
appalling disdain of Gerald and of the Sophia who had once deemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)
the paragon of men. Bah!

<p/>A carriage stopping in front of the house awakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
meditation. Madame Foucault and a man very much younger than Madame
Foucault got out of it. Sophia fled. After all, this prying into other
people's rooms was quite inexcusable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dropped on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own bed and
picked up a book, in case Madame Foucault should come in.

<p/>III

<p/>In the evening, just after night had fallen, Sophia on the bed heard
the sound of raised and acrimonious voices in Madame Foucault's room.
Nothing except dinner had happened since the arrival of Madame Foucault
and the young man. These two had evidently dined informally in the
bedroom on a dish or so prepared by Madame Foucault, who had herself
served Sophia with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) invalid's repast. The odours of cookery still
hung in the air.

<p/>The noise of virulent discussion increased and continued, and then
Sophia could hear sobbing, broken by short and fierce phrases from the
man. Then the door of the bedroom opened brusquely. <div class="bookquote">``J'en ai soupe!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man, in tones of angry disgust. <div class="bookquote">``Laisse-moi, je te prie!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then a soft muffled sound, as of a struggle, a quick step, and the
very violent banging of the front door. After that there was a
noticeable silence, save for the regular sobbing. Sophia wondered when
it would cease, that monotonous sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) called out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bed.

<p/>The sobbing grew louder, like the sobbing of a child who has detected
an awakening of sympathy and instinctively begins to practise upon it.
In the end Sophia arose and put on the peignoir which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had almost
determined never to wear again. The broad corridor was lighted by a
small, smelling oil-lamp with a crimson globe. That soft, transforming
radiance seemed to paint the whole corridor with voluptuous luxury: so
much so that it was impossible to believe that the smell came from the
lamp. Under the lamp lay Madame Foucault on the floor, a shapeless mass
of lace, frilled linen, and corset; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) light brown hair was loose and
spread about the floor. At the first glance, the creature abandoned to
grief made a romantic and striking picture, and Sophia thought for an
instant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had at length encountered life on a plane that would
correspond to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dreams of romance. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was impressed, with a
feeling somewhat akin to that of a middling commoner when confronted
with a viscount. There was, in the distance, something imposing and
sensational about that prone, trembling figure. The tragic works of
love were therein apparently manifest, in a sort of dignified beauty.
But when Sophia bent over Madame Foucault, and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flabbiness,
this illusion at once vanished; and instead of being dramatically
pathetic the woman was ridiculous. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, especially as damaged by
tears, could not support the ordeal of inspection; it was horrible; not
a picture, but a palette; or like the coloured design of a pavement
artist after a heavy shower. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) great, relaxed eyelids alone would
have rendered any face absurd; and there were monstrous details far
worse than the eyelids. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was amazingly fat; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flesh seemed to
be escaping at all ends from a corset strained to the utmost limit. And
above her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boots--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still wearing dainty, high-heeled, tightly
laced boots--the calves bulged suddenly out.

<p/>As a woman of between forty and fifty, the obese sepulchre of a dead
vulgar beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no right to passions and tears and homage, or
even the means of life; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no right to expose herself
picturesquely beneath a crimson glow in all the panoply of ribboned
garters and lacy seductiveness. It was silly; it was disgraceful. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
ought to have known that only youth and slimness have the right to
appeal to the feelings by indecent abandonments.

<p/>Such were the thoughts that mingled with the sympathy of the beautiful
and slim Sophia as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bent down to Madame Foucault. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was sorry for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) landlady, but at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and resented her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
woe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) has chucked me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>stammered Madame Foucault. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>)'s the last. I
have no one now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rolled over in the most grotesque manner, kicking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) legs, with
a fresh outburst of sobs. Sophia felt quite ashamed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and lie down. Come now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, with a touch of sharpness.
<div class="bookquote">``You musn't lie there like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Foucault's behaviour was really too outrageous. Sophia helped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), morally rather than physically, to rise, and then persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
into the large bedroom. Madame Foucault fell on the bed, of which the
counterpane had been thrown over the foot. Sophia covered the lower
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heaving body with the counterpane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, calm yourself, please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This room too was lit in crimson, by a small lamp that stood on the
night-table, and though the shade of the lamp was cracked, the general
effect of the great chamber was incontestably romantic. Only the
pillows of the wide bed and a small semi-circle of floor were
illuminated, all the rest lay in shadow. Madame Foucault's head had
dropped between the pillows. A tray containing dirty plates and glasses
and a wine-bottle was speciously picturesque on the writing-table.

<p/>Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) genuine gratitude to Madame Foucault for astounding care
during her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) illness, Sophia did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) landlady, and the present
scene made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) coldly wrathful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw the probability of having
another's troubles piled on the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mind, actively object, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not be more
hopelessly miserable than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) passively resented the
imposition. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reason told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to sympathize with this
ageing, ugly, disagreeable, undignified woman; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart was
reluctant; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart did not want to know anything at all about Madame
Foucault, nor to enter in any way into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) private life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not a single friend now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>stammered Madame Foucault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``You have Madame
Laurence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurence--that is not a friend. You know what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And me! I am your friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, in obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) conscience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>replied Madame Foucault, from the pillow. <div class="bookquote">``But you
know what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was that Sophia did know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) meant. The terms of their
intercourse had been suddenly changed. There was no pretentious
ceremony now, but the sincerity that disaster brings. The vast
structure of make-believe, which between them they had gradually built,
had crumbled to nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never treated badly any man in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>whimpered Madame Foucault.
``I have always been a--good girl. There is not a man who can say I have
not been a good girl. Never was I a girl like the rest. And every one
has said so. Ah! when I tell you that once I had a hotel in the Avenue
de la Reine Hortense. Four horses ... I have sold a horse to Madame
Musard... You know Madame Musard... But one cannot make economies.
Impossible to make economies! Ah! In `fifty-six I was spending a
hundred thousand francs a year. That cannot last. Always I have said to
myself: ``That cannot last.<div class="bookquote">'' Always I had the intention... But what
would you? I installed myself here, and borrowed money to pay for the
furniture. There did not remain to me one jewel. The men are poltroons,
all! I could let three bedrooms for three hundred and fifty francs a
month, and with serving meals and so on I could live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia interrupted, pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own bedroom across the
corridor, <div class="bookquote">``is your room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>said Madame Foucault. <div class="bookquote">``I put you in it because at the moment all
these were let. They are so no longer. Only one--Laurence--and she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) does
not pay me always. What would you? Tenants--that does not find itself
at the present hour... I have nothing, and I owe. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) quits me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
chooses this moment to quit me! And why? For nothing. For nothing. That
is not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) money that I regret him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>). No, no! You know, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
age--he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) is twenty-five--and with a woman like me--one is not generous!
No. I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>). And then a man is a moral support, always. I loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It is at my age, mine, that one knows how to love. Beauty goes
always, but not the temperament! Ah, that--No! ... I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I love
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia's face tingled with a sudden emotion caused by the repetition of
those last three words, whose spell no usage can mar.. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I shall become? There is nothing but that for me. And
I know of such, who are there already. A charwoman! Yes, a charwoman!
More soon or more late. Well, that is life. What would you? One exists
always.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then in a different tone: <div class="bookquote">``I demand your pardon, madame, for
talking like this. I ought to have shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>And Sophia felt that in listening she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) also ought to be ashamed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was not ashamed. Everything seemed very natural, and even ordinary.
And, moreover, Sophia was full of the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) superiority over the
woman on the bed. Four years ago, in the Restaurant Sylvain, the
ingenuous and ignorant Sophia had shyly sat in awe of the resplendent
courtesan, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) haughty stare, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) large, easy gestures, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
imperturbable contempt for the man who was paying. And now Sophia knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), Sophia, knew all that was to be known about human nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had not merely youth, beauty, and virtue, but knowledge--knowledge
enough to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a vigorous, clear
mind, and a clean conscience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could look any one in the face, and
judge every one too as a woman of the world. Whereas this obscene wreck
on the bed had nothing whatever left. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not merely lost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
effulgent beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had become repulsive. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could never have had
any commonsense, nor any force of character. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) haughtiness in the day
of glory was simply fatuous, based on stupidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had passed the
years in idleness, trailing about all day in stuffy rooms, and emerging
at night to impress nincompoops; continually meaning to do things which
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never did, continually surprised at the lateness of the hour,
continually occupied with the most foolish trifles. And here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at
over forty writhing about on the bare floor because a boy of
twenty-five -LRB-who MUST be a worthless idiot-RRB- had abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) after a
scene of ridiculous shoutings and stampings. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dependent on the
caprices of a young scamp, the last donkey to turn from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with
loathing! Sophia thought: <div class="bookquote">``Goodness! If I had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place I
shouldn't have been like that. I should have been rich. I should have
saved like a miser. I wouldn't have been dependent on anybody at that
age. If I couldn't have made a better courtesan than this pitiable
woman, I would have drowned myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>In the harsh vanity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) conscious capableness and young strength she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thought thus, half forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own follies, and half excusing them
on the ground of inexperience.

<p/>Sophia wanted to go round the flat and destroy every crimson lampshade
in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to shake Madame Foucault into self-respect and
sagacity. Moral reprehension, though present in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind, was only
faint. Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt the immense gulf between the honest woman and
the wanton, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not feel it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have expected to feel
it. <div class="bookquote">``What a fool you have been!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought; not: <div class="bookquote">``What a sinner!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) precocious cynicism, which was somewhat unsuited to the lovely
northern youthfulness of that face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to herself that the whole
situation and their relative attitudes would have been different if
only Madame Foucault had had the wit to amass a fortune, as -LRB-according
to Gerald-RRB- some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rivals had succeeded in doing.

<p/>And all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was thinking, in another part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind: <div class="bookquote">``I
ought not to be here. It's no use arguing. I ought not to be here.
Chirac did the only thing for me there was to do. But I must go now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Foucault continued to recite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) woes, chiefly financial, in a
weak voice damp with tears; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) also continued to apologize for
mentioning herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had finished sobbing, and lay looking at the
wall, away from Sophia, who stood irresolute near the bed, ashamed for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) companion's weakness and incapacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, irritated by the unrelieved
darkness of the picture drawn by Madame Foucault, <div class="bookquote">``that at least I owe
you a considerable sum, and that I am only waiting for you to tell me
how much it is. I have asked you twice already, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are still suffering!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>said Madame Foucault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite well enough to pay my debts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not like to accept money from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>said Madame Foucault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will have the doctor to pay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please do not talk in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I have money, and I can
pay for everything, and I shall pay for everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was annoyed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was sure that Madame Foucault was only
making a pretence of delicacy, and that in any case her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) delicacy was
preposterous. Sophia had remarked this on the two previous occasions
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had mentioned the subject of bills. Madame Foucault would not
treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as an ordinary lodger, now that the illness was past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
wanted, as it were, to complete brilliantly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had begun, and to
live in Sophia's memory as a unique figure of lavish philanthropy. This
was a sentiment, a luxury that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) desired to offer herself: the
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had played providence to a respectable married lady in
distress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) frequently hinted at Sophia's misfortunes and
helplessness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not afford the luxury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gazed at it as a
poor woman gazes at costly stuffs through the glass of a shop-window.
The truth was, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted the luxury for nothing. For a double reason
Sophia was exasperated: by Madame Foucault's absurd desire, and by a
natural objection to the role of a subject for philanthropy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
not admit that Madame Foucault's devotion as a nurse entitled her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) to
the satisfaction of being a philanthropist when there was no necessity
for philanthropy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have I been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>murmured Madame Foucault. <div class="bookquote">``Eight weeks--or is it nine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose we say nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>agreed Madame Foucault, apparently reluctant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, how much must I pay you per week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want anything--I don't want anything! You are a friend of
Chirac's. You--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia interrupted, tapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) foot and biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lip.
<div class="bookquote">``Naturally I must pay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Foucault wept quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I pay you seventy-five francs a week?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, anxious to
end the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Foucault protested, insincerely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? For all you have done for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak not of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>Madame Foucault modestly replied.

<p/>If the devotion was not to be paid for, then seventy-five francs a week
was assuredly too much, as during more than half the time Sophia had
had almost no food. Madame Foucault was therefore within the truth when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again protested, at sight of the bank-notes which Sophia brought
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) trunk:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure that it is too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Nine weeks at seventy-five. That makes
six hundred and seventy-five. Here are seven hundreds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>said Madame Foucault. <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will pay for the hire of the bath,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) laid the notes on the pillow. Madame Foucault looked at them
gluttonously, as any other person would have done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did
not touch them. After an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) burst into wild tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you cry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked, softened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>spluttered Madame Foucault. <div class="bookquote">``You are so beautiful. I
am so content that we saved you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) great wet eyes rested on Sophia.

<p/>It was sentimentality. Sophia ruthlessly set it down as sentimentality.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was touched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was suddenly moved. Those women, such as they
were in their foolishness, probably had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a
stranger! Flaccid as they were, they had been capable of resolute
perseverance there. It was possible to say that chance had thrown them
upon an enterprise which they could not have abandoned till they or
death had won. It was possible to say that they hoped vaguely to derive
advantage from their labours. But even then? Judged by an ordinary
standard, those women had been angels of mercy. And Sophia was
despising them, cruelly taking their motives to pieces, accusing them
of incapacity when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) herself stood a supreme proof of their capacity
in, at any rate, one direction! In a rush of emotion she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
hardness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) injustice.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bent down. <div class="bookquote">``Never can I forget how kind you have been to me. It is
incredible! Incredible!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spoke softly, in tones loaded with genuine
feeling. It was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not embroider on the theme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had no talent for thanksgiving.

<p/>Madame Foucault made the beginning of a gesture, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) meant to
kiss Sophia with those thick, marred lips; but refrained. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head sank
back, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a recurrence of the fit of nervous sobbing.
Immediately afterwards there was the sound of a latchkey in the
front-door of the flat; the bedroom door was open. Still sobbing very
violently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ear, and pushed the bank-notes under the
pillow.

<p/>Madame Laurence--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was called: Sophia had never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
surname--came straight into the bedroom, and beheld the scene with
astonishment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dark twinkling eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was usually dressed in
black, because people said that black suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and because black was
never out of fashion; black was an expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) idiosyncrasy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
showed a certain elegance, and by comparison with the extreme disorder
of Madame Foucault and the deshabille of Sophia her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) appearance, all
fresh from a modish restaurant, was brilliant; it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) an advantage
over the other two--that moral advantage which ceremonial raiment
always gives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it that passes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has chucked me, Laurence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Madame Foucault, in a sort of
hysteric scream which seemed to force its way through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sobs. From
the extraordinary freshness of Madame Foucault's woe, it might have
been supposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) young man had only that instant strode out.

<p/>Laurence and Sophia exchanged a swift glance; and Laurence, of course,
perceived that Sophia's relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) landlady and nurse were now
of a different, a more candid order. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) indicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) perception of
the change by a single slight movement of the eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But listen, Aimee,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said authoritatively. <div class="bookquote">``You must not let
yourself go like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Foucault. <div class="bookquote">``It is finished. And he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is the last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurence, ignoring Madame Foucault, approached Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``You have an air
very fatigued,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, caressing Sophia's shoulder with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gloved
hand. <div class="bookquote">``You are pale like everything. All this is not for you. It is not
reasonable to remain here, you still suffering! At this hour! Truly not
reasonable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hands persuaded Sophia towards the corridor. And, in fact, Sophia
did then notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own exhaustion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) departed from the room with the
ready obedience of physical weakness, and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door.

<p/>After about half an hour, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard confused noises and
murmurings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door half opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I enter, since you are not asleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>It was Laurence's voice.
Twice, now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had addressed Sophia without adding the formal <div class="bookquote">``madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enter, I beg you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia called from the bed. <div class="bookquote">``I am reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurence came in. Sophia was both glad and sorry to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
eager to hear gossip which, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to despise.
Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that if they talked that night they would talk as
friends, and that Laurence would ever afterwards treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with the
familiarity of a friend. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dreaded. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would yield, at any rate, to the temptation to listen to gossip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have put her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>said Laurence, in a whisper, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cautiously
closed the door. <div class="bookquote">``The poor woman! Oh, what a charming bracelet! It is a
true pearl, naturally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) roving eye had immediately, with an infallible instinct, caught
sight of a bracelet which, in taking stock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) possessions, Sophia
had accidentally left on the piano. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) picked it up, and then put it
down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was about to add: <div class="bookquote">``It's nearly all the
jewellery I possess;''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stopped.

<p/>Laurence moved towards Sophia's bed, and stood over it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had often
done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) quality as nurse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gloves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
made a piquant, pretty show, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thirty years, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) agreeable,
slightly roguish face, in which were mingled the knowingness of a
street boy and the confidence of a woman who has ceased to be surprised
at the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) snub nose on a highly intelligent man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tell you what they had quarrelled about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>Laurence inquired
abruptly. And not only the phrasing of the question, but the assured
tone in which it was uttered, showed that Laurence meant to be the
familiar of Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>In this brief question and reply, all was crudely implied that had
previously been supposed not to exist. The relations between the two
women were altered irretrievably in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must have been her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fault!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>said Laurence. <div class="bookquote">``With men she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is
insupportable. I have never understood how that poor woman has made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
way. With women she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is charming. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems to be incapable of not
treating men like dogs. Some men adore that, but they are few. Is it
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! How many times have I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! But it is useless. It
is stronger than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finishes on straw one will be able
to say that it was because of that. But truly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought not to have
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) here! Truly that was too much! If he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Sophia, awkwardly. The answer startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room has not been disinfected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought all the flat had been disinfected?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All except her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurence shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not want to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
things! Is it that I know, I? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is like that. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes an idea--and
then, there you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me every room had been disinfected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told the same to the police and the doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then all the disinfection is useless?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly! But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is like that. This flat might be very remunerative;
but with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), never! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not even paid for the furniture--after two
years!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another shrug of the shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``All that I know is that it
will be necessary for me to leave here. The last time I brought
Monsieur Cerf here, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was excessively rude to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cerf</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has doubtless
told you about Monsieur Cerf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Who is Monsieur Cerf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not told you? That astonishes me. Monsieur Cerf, that is
my friend, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>Laurence proceeded, impelled by a desire to impress Sophia and
to gossip at large. <div class="bookquote">``That is my friend. I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at the hospital. It
was to please him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that I left the hospital. After that we quarrelled
for two years; but at the end he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gave me right. I did not budge. Two
years! It is long. And I had left the hospital. I could have gone back.
But I would not. That is not a life, to be nurse in a Paris hospital!
No, I drew myself out as well as I could ... He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is the most charming
boy you can imagine! And rich now; that is to say, relatively. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has a
cousin infinitely more rich than he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). I dined with them both to-night at
the Maison Doree. For a luxurious boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a luxurious boy--the
cousin I mean. It appears that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has made a fortune in Canada.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with politeness. Laurence's hand was playing on
the edge of the bed, and Sophia observed for the first time that it
bore a wedding-ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remark my ring?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>Laurence laughed. ``That is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--the cousin.
``What!<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) said, `you do not wear an alliance? An alliance is more
proper. We are going to arrange that after dinner.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said that all the
jewellers' shops would be closed. <div class="bookquote">``That is all the same to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``We will open one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And in effect ... it passed like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
succeeded! Is it not beautiful?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) held forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``It is very beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours also is beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>said Laurence, with an extremely puzzling
intonation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just the ordinary English wedding-ring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. In spite
of herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I have married you. It is I, the cure, said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--the cousin--when
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) put the ring on my finger. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is excessively amusing! He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pleases
me much. And he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is all alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) asked me whether I knew among my
friends a sympathetic, pretty girl, to make four with us three for a
picnic. I said I was not sure, but I thought not. Whom do I know?
Nobody. I'm not a woman like the rest. I am always discreet. I do not
like casual relations... But he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is very well, the cousin. Brown
eyes... It is an idea--will you come, one day? He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) speaks English. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
loves the English. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is all that is most correct, the perfect
gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would arrange a dazzling fete. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be
enchanted to make your acquaintance. Enchanted! ... As for my Charles,
happily he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is completely mad about me--otherwise I should have fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smile was a genuine respect for Sophia's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I cannot come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) honestly endeavoured to keep
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reply any accent of moral superiority, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not quite
succeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not at all horrified by Laurence's suggestion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
meant simply to refuse it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not do so in a natural voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true you are not yet strong enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>said the imperturbable
Laurence, quickly, and with a perfect imitation of naturalness. <div class="bookquote">``But
soon you must make a little promenade.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ring. <div class="bookquote">``After
all, it is more proper,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) observed judicially. <div class="bookquote">``With a wedding-ring
one is less likely to be annoyed. What is curious is that the idea
never before came to me. Yet ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You like jewellery?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I like jewellery!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a gesture of the hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you pass me that bracelet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurence obeyed, and Sophia clasped it round the girl's wrist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>Laurence exclaimed, ravished. <div class="bookquote">``It is too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``And when you look at it, you must
remember how kind you were to me, and how grateful I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How nicely you say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>Laurence said ecstatically.

<p/>And Sophia felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had indeed said it rather nicely. This giving
of the bracelet, souvenir of one of the few capricious follies that
Gerald had committed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and not for himself, pleased Sophia very
much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid your nursing of me forced you to neglect Monsieur Cerf,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a little!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>said Laurence, impartially, with a small pout of
haughtiness. <div class="bookquote">``It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cerf</b></font>) used to complain. But I soon put him (<font color='blue'><b>Cerf</b></font>)
straight. What an idea! He (<font color='blue'><b>Cerf</b></font>) knows there are things upon which I do not
joke. It is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Cerf</b></font>) who will quarrel a second time! Believe me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurence's absolute conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) power was what impressed Sophia.
To Sophia she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seemed to be a vulgar little piece of goods, with dubious
charm and a glance that was far too brazen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) movements were vulgar.
And Sophia wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had established her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) empire and upon what it
rested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not show this to Aimee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>whispered Laurence, indicating the
bracelet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way, have I told you that war is declared?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div>Laurence casually
remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``What war?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The scene with Aimee made me forget it ... With Germany. The city is
quite excited. An immense crowd in front of the new Opera. They say we
shall be at Berlin in a month--or at most two months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Why is there a war?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! It is I who asked that. Nobody knows. It is those Prussians.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think we ought to begin again with the disinfecting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia
asked anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``I must speak to Madame Foucault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurence</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurence told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) not to worry, and went off to show the bracelet to
Madame Foucault. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had privately decided that this was a pleasure
which, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not deny herself.

<p/>IV

<p/>About a fortnight later--it was a fine Saturday in early
August--Sophia, with a large pinafore over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dress, was finishing the
portentous preparations for disinfecting the flat. Part of the affair
was already accomplished, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own room and the corridor having been
fumigated on the previous day, in spite of the opposition of Madame
Foucault, who had taken amiss Laurence's tale-bearing to Sophia.
Laurence had left the flat--under exactly what circumstances Sophia
knew not, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) guessed that it must have been in consequence of a
scene elaborating the tiff caused by Madame Foucault's resentment
against Laurence. The brief, factitious friendliness between Laurence
and Sophia had gone like a dream, and Laurence had gone like a dream.
The servant had been dismissed; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) place Madame Foucault employed a
charwoman each morning for two hours. Finally, Madame Foucault had been
suddenly called away that morning by a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sick father at St.
Mammes-sur-Seine. Sophia was delighted at the chance. The disinfecting
of the flat had become an obsession with Sophia--the obsession of a
convalescent whose perspective unconsciously twists things to the most
wry shapes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had had trouble on the day before with Madame Foucault,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was expecting more serious trouble when the moment arrived for
ejecting Madame Foucault as well as all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) movable belongings from
Madame Foucault's own room. Nevertheless, Sophia had been determined,
whatever should happen, to complete an honest fumigation of the entire
flat. Hence the eagerness with which, urging Madame Foucault to go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father, Sophia had protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was perfectly strong and
could manage by herself for a couple of days. Owing to the partial
suppression of the ordinary railway services in favour of military
needs, Madame Foucault could not hope to go and return on the same day.
Sophia had lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a louis.

<p/>Pans of sulphur were mysteriously burning in each of the three front
rooms, and two pairs of doors had been pasted over with paper, to
prevent the fumes from escaping. The charwoman had departed. Sophia,
with brush, scissors, flour-paste, and news-sheets, was sealing the
third pair of doors, when there was a ring at the front door.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had only to cross the corridor in order to open.

<p/>It was Chirac. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). The outbreak of the
war had induced even Sophia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) landlady to look through at least
one newspaper during the day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had in this way learnt, from an
article signed by Chirac, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had returned to Paris after a mission
into the Vosges country for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) paper.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) started on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) breathed out the exclamation slowly.
And then smiled, seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand, and kissed it.

<p/>The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) obvious extreme pleasure in meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again was the
sweetest experience that had fallen to Sophia for years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are cured?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``You know, this is an enormous relief to me, to know,
veritably, that you are no longer in danger. You gave me a fright ...
but a fright, my dear madame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled in silence.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) glanced inquiringly up and down the corridor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all alone in the flat. I'm disinfecting it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then that is sulphur that I smell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me while I finish this door,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) closed the front-door. <div class="bookquote">``But you seem to be quite at home here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) glanced again inquiringly up and down the corridor. <div class="bookquote">``And you are
really all alone now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) asked, as though to be doubly sure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) explained the circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I owe you my most sincere excuses for bringing you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said
confidentially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) replied, looking intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door. <div class="bookquote">``They have been
most kind to me. Nobody could have been kinder. And Madame Laurence
being such a good nurse--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That was a reason. In effect they are both very
good-natured little women... You comprehend, as journalist it arrives
to me to know all kinds of people ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) fingers ... <div class="bookquote">``And
as we were opposite the house. In fine, I pray you to excuse me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold me this paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is necessary that every crack
should be covered; also between the floor and the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You English are wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) murmured, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) took the paper.
<div class="bookquote">``Imagine you doing that! Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) added, resuming the confidential
tone, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will leave the Foucault now, hein?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said carelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You go to England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) patted the creases out of a strip of paper
with a duster, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is not indiscreet, where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said candidly.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was without a plan. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brain told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to return to Bursley, or, at the least, write. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pride
would not hear of such a surrender. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) situation would have to be far
more desperate than it was before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) defeat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
family even in a letter. A thousand times no! That was a point which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had for ever decided. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would face any disaster, and any other
shame, rather than the shame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) family's forgiving reception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``How does it go? This war?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), in a few words, a few leading facts about himself. <div class="bookquote">``It
must not be said,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) added of the war, <div class="bookquote">``but that will turn out ill!
I--I know, you comprehend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) answered with casualness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have heard nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? Gerald?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) gave a gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing! Not a word! Nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) will have gone back to England!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said positively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) prefers France. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) really does like France. I think it is
the only real passion he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) ever had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is astonishing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>reflected Chirac, <div class="bookquote">``how France is loved! And
yet...! But to live, what will he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) do? Must live!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia merely shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is finished between you two?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) muttered awkwardly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nodded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knees, at the lower crack of the doors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, rising. <div class="bookquote">``It's well done, isn't it? That is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) squarely, in the obscurity of the untidy
and shabby corridor. Both felt that they had become very intimate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
was intensely flattered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attitude, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will take off my pinafore. Where can I niche you?
There is only my bedroom, and I want that. What are we to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) suggested diffidently. <div class="bookquote">``Will you do me the honour to come
for a drive? That will do you good. There is sunshine. And you are
always very pale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) agreed cordially.

<p/>While dressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) walking up and down the corridor;
occasionally they exchanged a few words. Before leaving, Sophia pulled
off the paper from one of the key-holes of the sealed suite of rooms,
and they peered through, one after the other, and saw the green glow of
the sulphur, and were troubled by its uncanniness. And then Sophia
refixed the paper.

<p/>In descending the stairs of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt the infirmity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
knees; but in other respects, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been out only once before
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of a sufficient strength. A
disinclination for any enterprise had prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from taking the air
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to have done, but within the flat she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had exercised her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
limbs in many small tasks. The little Chirac, nervously active and
restless, wanted to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arm, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not allow it.

<p/>The concierge and part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) family stared curiously at Sophia as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
passed under the archway, for the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) illness had excited the
interest of the whole house. Just as the carriage was driving off, the
concierge came across the pavement and paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) compliments, and then
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not know by hazard why Madame Foucault has not returned for
lunch, madame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the concierge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Returned for lunch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Foucault</b></font>) will not come back till
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The concierge</b></font>)</div><p/>The concierge made a face. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! How curious it is! She (<font color='blue'><b>Foucault</b></font>) told my husband
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Foucault</b></font>) would return in two hours. It is very grave! Question of
business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Chirac looked at each
other. The concierge murmured thanks and went off muttering
indistinctly.

<p/>The fiacre turned down the Rue Laferriere, the horse slipping and
sliding as usual over the cobblestones. Soon they were on the
boulevard, making for the Champs Elysees and the Bois de Boulogne.

<p/>The fresh breeze and bright sunshine and the large freedom of the
streets quickly intoxicated Sophia--intoxicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), that is to say, in
quite a physical sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was almost drunk, with the heady savour of
life itself. A mild ecstasy of well-being overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw the
flat as a horrible, vile prison, and blamed herself for not leaving it
sooner and oftener. The air was medicine, for body and mind too. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
perspective was instantly corrected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was happy, living neither in
the past nor in the future, but in and for that hour. And beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
happiness moved a wistful melancholy for the Sophia who had suffered
such a captivity and such woes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) yearned for more and yet more
delight, for careless orgies of passionate pleasure, in the midst of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would forget all trouble. Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refused the offer of
Laurence? Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) not rushed at once into the splendid fire of
joyous indulgence, ignoring everything but the crude, sensuous
instinct? Acutely aware as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) youth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
charm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refusal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refusal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
placidly observed it as the result of some tremendously powerful motive
in herself, which could not be questioned or reasoned with--which was,
in fact, the essential HER.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I look like an invalid?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked, leaning back luxuriously in the
carriage among the crowd of other vehicles.

<p/>Chirac hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``My faith! Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said at length. <div class="bookquote">``But it becomes
you. If I did not know that you have little love for compliments, I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I adore compliments!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``What made you think that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) youthfully burst out, <div class="bookquote">``you are more ravishing than
ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gave herself up deliciously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) admiration.

<p/>After a silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! if you knew how disquieted I was about
you, away there...! I should not know how to tell you. Veritably
disquieted, you comprehend! What could I do? Tell me a little about
your illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recounted details.

<p/>As the fiacre entered the Rue Royale, they noticed a crowd of people in
front of the Madeleine shouting and cheering.

<p/>The cabman turned towards them. <div class="bookquote">``It appears there has been a victory!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A victory! If only it was true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>murmured Chirac, cynically.

<p/>In the Rue Royale people were running frantically to and fro, laughing
and gesticulating in glee. The customers in the cafes stood on their
chairs, and even on tables, to watch, and occasionally to join in, the
sudden fever. The fiacre was slowed to a walking pace. Flags and
carpets began to show from the upper storeys of houses. The crowd grew
thicker and more febrile. <div class="bookquote">``Victory! Victory!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rang hoarsely, shrilly,
and hoarsely again in the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac, trembling. <div class="bookquote">``It must be a true victory! We are
saved! We are saved! ... Oh yes, it is true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But naturally it is true! What are you saying?''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>demanded the driver.

<p/>At the Place de la Concorde the fiacre had to stop altogether. The
immense square was a sea of white hats and flowers and happy faces,
with carriages anchored like boats on its surface. Flag after flag
waved out from neighbouring roofs in the breeze that tempered the
August sun. Then hats began to go up, and cheers rolled across the
square like echoes of firing in an enclosed valley. Chirac's driver
jumped madly on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) seat, and cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) whip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vive la France!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) bawled with all the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) lungs.

<p/>A thousand throats answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).

<p/>Then there was a stir behind them. Another carriage was being slowly
forced to the front. The crowd was pushing it, and crying,
<div class="bookquote">``Marseillaise! Marseillaise!''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>In the carriage was a woman alone; not
beautiful, but distinguished, and with the assured gaze of one who is
accustomed to homage and multitudinous applause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Gueymard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac to Sophia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was very pale. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) too
shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Marseillaise!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) features were distorted.

<p/>The woman rose and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coachman, who offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hand and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
climbed to the box seat, and stood on it and bowed several times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marseillaise!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The cry continued. Then a roar of cheers, and then
silence spread round the square like an inundation. And amid this
silence the woman began to sing the Marseillaise. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sang, the
tears ran down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks. Everybody in the vicinity was weeping or
sternly frowning. In the pauses of the first verse could be heard the
rattle of horses' bits, or a whistle of a tug on the river. The
refrain, signalled by a proud challenging toss of Gueymard's head,
leapt up like a tropical tempest, formidable, overpowering. Sophia, who
had had no warning of the emotion gathering within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), sobbed
violently. At the close of the hymn Gueymard's carriage was assaulted
by worshippers. All around, in the tumult of shouting, men were kissing
and embracing each other; and hats went up continually in fountains.
Chirac leaned over the side of the carriage and wrung the hand of a man
who was standing by the wheel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked, in an unsteady voice, to break the
inexplicable tension within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was weeping like a child. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) sang
out: <div class="bookquote">``Victory! To Berlin! Victory!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>V

<p/>Sophia walked alone, with tired limbs, up the damaged oak stairs to the
flat. Chirac had decided that, in the circumstances of the victory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
would do well to go to the offices of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) paper rather earlier than
usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) back to the Rue Breda. They had taken leave
of each other in a sort of dream or general enchantment due to their
participation in the vast national delirium which somehow dominated
individual feelings. They did not define their relations. They had been
conscious only of emotion.

<p/>The stairs, which smelt of damp even in summer, disgusted Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thought of the flat with horror and longed for green places and luxury.
On the landing were two stoutish, ill-dressed men, of middle age,
apparently waiting. Sophia found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) key and opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon, madame!''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said one of the men, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) hat, and they both
pushed into the flat after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). They stared, puzzled, at the strips of
paper pasted on the doors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked haughtily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was very frightened. The
extraordinary interruption brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) down with a shock to the scale
of the individual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the concierge,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man who had addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the
air of a superior artisan. <div class="bookquote">``It was my wife who spoke to you this
afternoon. This,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion, <div class="bookquote">``this is the law. I regret
it, but ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>The law saluted and shut the front door. Like the concierge, the law
emitted an odour--the odour of uncleanliness on a hot August day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, madame, not the rent: the furniture!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) learnt the history of the furniture. It had belonged to the
concierge, who had acquired it from a previous tenant and sold it on
credit to Madame Foucault. Madame Foucault had signed bills and had not
met them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had made promises and broken them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had done
everything except discharge her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liabilities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been warned and
warned again. That day had been fixed as the last limit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
solemnly assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) creditor that on that day she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would pay. On
leaving the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had stated precisely and clearly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
return before lunch with all the money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had made no mention of a
sick father.

<p/>Sophia slowly perceived the extent of Madame Foucault's duplicity and
moral cowardice. No doubt the sick father was an invention. The woman,
at the end of a tether which no ingenuity of lies could further
lengthen, had probably absented herself solely to avoid the pain of
witnessing the seizure. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would do anything, however silly, to avoid
an immediate unpleasantness. Or perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had absented herself
without any particular aim, but simply in the hope that something
fortunate might occur. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had hoped that Sophia, taken
unawares, would generously pay. Sophia smiled grimly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can't do anything. I suppose you must do what you
have to do. You will let me pack up my own affairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly, madame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) warned them as to the danger of opening the sealed rooms. The man
of the law seemed prepared to stay in the corridor indefinitely. No
prospect of delay disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Strange and disturbing, the triumph of the concierge! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a
locksmith by trade. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and their children lived in two
little dark rooms by the archway--an insignificant fragment of the
house. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was away from home about fourteen hours every day, except
Sundays, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) washed the courtyard. All the other duties of the
concierge were performed by the wife. The pair always looked poor,
untidy, dirty, and rather forlorn. But they were steadily levying toll
on everybody in the big house. They amassed money in forty ways. They
lived for money, and all men have what they live for. With what
arrogant gestures Madame Foucault would descend from a carriage at the
great door! What respectful attitudes and tones the ageing courtesan
would receive from the wife and children of the concierge! But beneath
these conventional fictions the truth was that the concierge held the
whip. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was using it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had given himself a half-holiday
in order to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) second acquirement of the ostentatious
furniture and the crimson lampshades. This was one of the dramatic
crises in his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) career as a man of substance. The national thrill of
victory had not penetrated into the flat with the concierge and the
law. The emotions of the concierge were entirely independent of the
Napoleonic foreign policy.

<p/>As Sophia, sick with a sudden disillusion, was putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) things
together, and wondering where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was to go, and whether it would be
politic to consult Chirac, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard a fluster at the front door:
cries, protestations, implorings. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own door was thrust open, and
Madame Foucault burst in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Save me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Madame Foucault, sinking to the ground.

<p/>The feeble theatricality of the gesture offended Sophia's taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
asked sternly what Madame Foucault expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to do. Had not Madame
Foucault knowingly exposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), without the least warning, to the
extreme annoyance of this visit of the law, a visit which meant
practically that Sophia was put into the street?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not be hard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Foucault sobbed.

<p/>Sophia learnt the complete history of the woman's efforts to pay for
the furniture: a farrago of folly and deceptions. Madame Foucault
confessed too much. Sophia scorned confession for the sake of
confession. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) scorned the impulse which forces a weak creature to
insist on its weakness, to revel in remorse, and to find an excuse for
its conduct in the very fact that there is no excuse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gathered that
Madame Foucault had in fact gone away in the hope that Sophia, trapped,
would pay; and that in the end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not even had the courage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
own trickery, and had run back, driven by panic into audacity, to fall
at Sophia's feet, lest Sophia might not have yielded and the furniture
have been seized. From, beginning to end the conduct of Madame Foucault
had been fatuous and despicable and wicked. Sophia coldly condemned
Madame Foucault for having allowed herself to be brought into the world
with such a weak and maudlin character, and for having allowed herself
to grow old and ugly. As a sight the woman was positively disgraceful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Save me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed again. <div class="bookquote">``I did what I could for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But the logic of the appeal was irresistible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what can I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked reluctantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lend me the money. You can. If you don't, this will be the end for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a good thing, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>thought Sophia's hard sense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia glumly asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a thousand francs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame Foucault with eagerness. <div class="bookquote">``All
my beautiful furniture will go for less than a thousand francs! Save
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was nauseating Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please rise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hands fidgeting undecidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall repay you, surely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Foucault asseverated. <div class="bookquote">``I swear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) take me for a fool?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>thought Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) oaths!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I won't lend you the money. But I tell you what I
will do. I will buy the furniture at that price; and I will promise to
re-sell it to you as soon as you can pay me. Like that, you can be
tranquil. But I have very little money. I must have a guarantee. The
furniture must be mine till you pay me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an angel of charity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Foucault, embracing
Sophia's skirts. <div class="bookquote">``I will do whatever you wish. Ah! You Englishwomen are
astonishing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia was not an angel of charity. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had promised to do
involved sacrifice and anxiety without the prospect of reward. But it
was not charity. It was part of the price Sophia paid for the exercise
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) logical faculty; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paid it unwillingly. <div class="bookquote">``I did what I could
for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia would have died sooner than remind any one of a
benefit conferred, and Madame Foucault had committed precisely that
enormity. The appeal was inexcusable to a fine mind; but it was
effective.

<p/>The men were behind the door, listening. Sophia paid out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stock
of notes. Needless to say, the total was more and not less than a
thousand francs. Madame Foucault grew rapidly confidential with the
man. Without consulting Sophia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked the bailiff to draw up a
receipt transferring the ownership of all the furniture to Sophia; and
the bailiff, struck into obligingness by glimpses of Sophia's beauty,
consented to do so. There was much conferring upon forms of words, and
flourishing of pens between thick, vile fingers, and scattering of ink.

<p/>Before the men left Madame Foucault uncorked a bottle of wine for them,
and helped them to drink it. Throughout the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
insupportably deferential to Sophia, who was driven to bed. Madame
Foucault contentedly went up to the sixth floor to occupy the servant's
bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was glad to get so far away from the sulphur, of which a
few faint fumes had penetrated into the corridor.

<p/>The next morning, after a stifling night of bad dreams, Sophia was too
ill to get up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked round at the furniture in the little room,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) imagined the furniture in the other rooms, and dismally
thought: <div class="bookquote">``All this furniture is mine. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will never pay me! I am
saddled with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was cheaply bought, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) probably could not sell it for even what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had paid. Still, the sense of ownership was reassuring.

<p/>The charwoman brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) coffee, and Chirac's newspaper; from which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) learnt that the news of the victory which had sent the city mad on
the previous day was utterly false. Tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
gazed absently at all the curtained windows of the courtyard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
youth and loveliness; according to the rules she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to have been
irresponsible, gay, and indulgently watched over by the wisdom of
admiring age. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt towards the French nation as a mother might
feel towards adorable, wilful children suffering through their own
charming foolishness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw France personified in Chirac. How easily,
despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) special knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had yielded to the fever! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart
bled for France and Chirac on that morning of reaction and of truth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not bear to recall the scene in the Place de la Concorde.
Madame Foucault had not descended.




<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>THE SIEGE

<p/>I


<p/>Madame Foucault came into Sophia's room one afternoon with a peculiar
guilty expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) large face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) peignoir close to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exuberant body in folds consciously majestic, as though
endeavouring to prove to Sophia by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) carriage that despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
shifting eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the most righteous and sincere woman that ever
lived.

<p/>It was Saturday, the third of September, a beautiful day. Sophia,
suffering from an unimportant relapse, had remained in a state of
inactivity, and had scarcely gone out at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loathed the flat, but
lacked the energy to leave it every day. There was no sufficiently
definite object in leaving it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not go out and look for health
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have looked for flowers. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remained in the flat, and
stared at the courtyard and the continual mystery of lives hidden
behind curtains that occasionally moved. And the painted yellow walls
of the house, and the papered walls of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) room pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and
crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). For a few days Chirac had called daily, animated by the
most adorable solicitude. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had ceased to call. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had tired of
reading the journals; they lay unopened. The relations between Madame
Foucault and herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) status in the flat of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) now
legally owned the furniture,--these things were left unsettled. But the
question of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) board was arranged on the terms that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) halved the
cost of food and service with Madame Foucault; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) expenses were thus
reduced to the lowest possible--about eighteen francs a week. An idea
hung in the air--like a scientific discovery on the point of being made
by several independent investigators simultaneously--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and
Madame Foucault should co-operate in order to let furnished rooms at a
remunerative profit. Sophia felt the nearness of the idea and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
wanted to be shocked at the notion of any avowed association between
herself and Madame Foucault; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are a lady and a gentleman who want a bedroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>began Madame
Foucault, <div class="bookquote">``a nice large bedroom, furnished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia; <div class="bookquote">``who are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will pay a hundred and thirty francs a month, in advance, for the
middle bedroom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've shown it to them already?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone implied
that somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of a right to overlook the affair of
Madame Foucault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. <div class="bookquote">``I said to myself that first I would ask you for
a counsel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then will they pay all that for a room they haven't seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>said Madame Foucault, sheepishly. <div class="bookquote">``The lady has seen the
room before. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little. It is a former tenant. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived here
some weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was poor enough then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the corridor. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very well, the lady. Naturally one must live,
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) like all the world; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is veritably well. Quite respectable!
One would never say ... Then there would be the meals. We could demand
one franc for the cafe au lait, two and a half francs for the lunch,
and three francs for the dinner. Without counting other things. That
would mean over five hundred francs a month, at least. And what would
they cost us? Almost nothing! By what appears, he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a plutocrat ... I
could thus quickly repay you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a married couple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! You know, one cannot demand the marriage certificate.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame
Foucault indicated by a gesture that the Rue Breda was not the paradise
of saints.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>plutocrat</b></font>) came before, this lady, was it with the same man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia
asked coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my faith, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Madame Foucault, bridling. <div class="bookquote">``It was a bad
sort, the other, a...! Ah, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask my advice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia abruptly questioned, in a hard,
inimical voice. <div class="bookquote">``Is it that it concerns me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears came at once into the eyes of Madame Foucault. <div class="bookquote">``Do not be
unkind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) implored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not unkind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, in the same tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you leave me if I accept this offer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, bluntly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tried to be large-hearted,
large-minded, and sympathetic; but there was no sign of these qualities
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you take with you the furniture which is yours...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia kept silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to live, I demand of you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Foucault asked weakly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By being respectable and dealing with respectable people!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said
Sophia, uncompromisingly, in tones of steel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am unhappy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>murmured the elder woman. <div class="bookquote">``However, you are more strong
than I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brusquely dabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes, gave a little sob, and ran out of the
room. Sophia listened at the door, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dismiss the would-be
tenants of the best bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should possess such
moral ascendancy over the woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) so young and ingenuous! For, of
course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not meant to remove the furniture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could hear
Madame Foucault sobbing quietly in one of the other rooms; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips
curled.

<p/>Before evening a truly astonishing event happened. Perceiving that
Madame Foucault showed no signs of bestirring herself, Sophia, with
good nature in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart but not on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tongue, went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I occupy myself with the dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Foucault sobbed more loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be very amiable on your part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>Madame Foucault managed at
last to reply, not very articulately.

<p/>Sophia put a hat on and went to the grocer's. The grocer, who kept a
busy establishment at the corner of the Rue Clausel, was a middle-aged
and wealthy man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young wife and two children to
Normandy until victory over the Prussians should be more assured, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked Sophia whether it was true that there was a good bedroom to
let in the flat where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lived. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servant was ill of smallpox; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was attacked by anxieties and fears on all sides; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not enter
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own flat on account of possible infection; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked Sophia, and
Madame Foucault had been a customer of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with intervals, for twenty
years. Within an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had arranged to rent the middle bedroom at
eighty francs a month, and to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meals there. The terms were
modest, but the respectability was prodigious. All the glory of this
tenancy fell upon Sophia.

<p/>Madame Foucault was deeply impressed. Characteristically she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began at
once to construct a theory that Sophia had only to walk out of the
house in order to discover ideal tenants for the rooms. Also she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
regarded the advent of the grocer as a reward from Providence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
self-denial in refusing the profits of sinfulness. Sophia felt
personally responsible to the grocer for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comfort, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
herself undertook the preparation of the room. Madame Foucault was
amazed at the thoroughness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) housewifery, and at the ingenuity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ideas for the arrangement of furniture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat and watched with
admiration sycophantic but real.

<p/>That night, when Sophia was in bed, Madame Foucault came into the room,
and dropped down by the side of the bed, and begged Sophia to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
moral support for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) confessed herself generally. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) explained
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had always hated the negation of respectability; how
respectability was the one thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life passionately
desired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said that if Sophia would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) partner in the letting of
furnished rooms to respectable persons, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in
everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gave Sophia a list of all the traits in Sophia's
character which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) admired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked Sophia to influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), to
stand by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would sleep on the sixth floor in
the servant's tiny room; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a vision of three bedrooms let to
successful tradesmen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in an ecstasy of repentance and good
intentions.

<p/>Sophia consented to the business proposition; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had nothing else
whatever in prospect, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shared Madame Foucault's rosy view about
the remunerativeness of the bedrooms. With three tenants who took meals
the two women would be able to feed themselves for nothing and still
make a profit on the food; and the rents would be clear gain.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt very sorry for the ageing, feckless Madame Foucault, whose
sincerity was obvious. The association between them would be strange;
it would have been impossible to explain it to St. Luke's Square...
And yet, if there was anything at all in the virtue of Christian
charity, what could properly be urged against the association?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>murmured Madame Foucault, kissing Sophia's hands, <div class="bookquote">``it is to-day,
then, that I recommence my life. You will see--you will see! You have
saved me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a strange sight, the time-worn, disfigured courtesan, half
prostrate before the beautiful young creature proud and unassailable in
the instinctive force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own character. It was almost a didactic
tableau, fraught with lessons for the vicious. Sophia was happier than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been for years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a purpose in existence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a fluid
soul to mould to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) will according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wisdom; and there was a
large compassion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) credit. Public opinion could not intimidate
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), for in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) case there was no public opinion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew nobody;
nobody had the right to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) doings.

<p/>The next day, Sunday, they both worked hard at the bedrooms from early
morning. The grocer was installed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chamber, and the two other
rooms were cleansed as they had never been cleansed. At four o'clock,
the weather being more magnificent than ever, Madame Foucault said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we took a promenade on the boulevard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia reflected. They were partners. <div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) agreed.

<p/>The boulevard was crammed with gay, laughing crowds. All the cafes were
full. None, who did not know, could have guessed that the news of Sedan
was scarcely a day old in the capital. Delirious joy reigned in the
glittering sunshine. As the two women strolled along, content with
their industry and their resolves, they came to a National Guard, who,
perched on a ladder, was chipping away the <div class="bookquote">``N''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>from the official sign
of a court-tradesman. He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was exchanging jokes with a circle of open
mouths. It was in this way that Madame Foucault and Sophia learnt of
the establishment of a republic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vive la republique!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Foucault/Foucault</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Foucault, incontinently, and then
apologized to Sophia for the lapse.

<p/>They listened a long while to a man who was telling strange histories
of the Empress.

<p/>Suddenly Sophia noticed that Madame Foucault was no longer at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
elbow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glanced about, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in earnest conversation with a
young man whose face seemed familiar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered it was the young
man with whom Madame Foucault had quarrelled on the night when Sophia
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) prone in the corridor; the last remaining worshipper of the
courtesan.

<p/>The woman's face was quite changed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) agitation. Sophia drew away,
offended. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) watched the pair from a distance for a few moments, and
then, furious in disillusion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) escaped from the fever of the
boulevards and walked quietly home. Madame Foucault did not return.
Apparently Madame Foucault was doomed to be the toy of chance. Two days
later Sophia received a scrawled letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), with the information
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lover had required that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to Brussels,
as Paris would soon be getting dangerous. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) adores me always. He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is
the most delicious boy. As I have always said, this is the grand
passion of my life. I am happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) would not permit me to come to you.
He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) has spent two thousand francs on clothes for me, since naturally I
had nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And so on. No word of apology. Sophia, in reading the
letter, allowed for a certain exaggeration and twisting of the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young fool! Fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) burst out angrily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not mean herself;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) meant the fatuous adorer of that dilapidated, horrible woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again. Doubtless Madame Foucault fulfilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own
prediction as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ultimate destiny, but in Brussels.

<p/>II

<p/>Sophia still possessed about a hundred pounds, and had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chosen to
leave Paris and France, there was nothing to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from doing so.
Perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had chanced to visit the Gare St. Lazare or the Gare du
Nord, the sight of tens of thousands of people flying seawards might
have stirred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the desire to flee also from the vague coming
danger. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not visit those termini; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was too busy looking
after M. Niepce, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grocer. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
furniture, which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to be a sort of rock. With a flat full
of furniture she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought to be able to devise a
livelihood; the enterprise of becoming independent was already indeed
begun. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ardently wished to be independent, to utilize in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own
behalf the gifts of organization, foresight, commonsense and tenacity
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) possessed and which had lain idle. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hated the
idea of flight.

<p/>Chirac returned as unexpectedly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had gone; an expedition for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
paper had occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). With his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) lips he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to go, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) eyes
spoke differently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had, one afternoon, a mood of candid despair,
such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) would have dared to show only to one in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) felt great
confidence. <div class="bookquote">``They will come to Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``nothing can stop them.
And ... then...!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) gave a cynical laugh. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to go
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about my furniture? And I've promised M. Niepce to look after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Chirac informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was without a lodging, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
would like to rent one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rooms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) agreed.

<p/>Shortly afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) introduced a middle-aged acquaintance named
Carlier, the secretary-general of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) newspaper, who wished to rent a
bedroom. Thus by good fortune Sophia let all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rooms immediately, and
was sure of over two hundred francs a month, apart from the profit on
meals supplied. On this latter occasion Chirac -LRB-and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) companion too-RRB-
was quite optimistic, reiterating an absolute certitude that Paris
could never be invested. Briefly, Sophia did not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
believed the candidly despairing Chirac. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no information, no
wide theory, to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pessimism; nothing but the inward
conviction that the race capable of behaving as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had seen it behave
in the Place de la Concorde, was bound to be defeated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loved the
French race; but all the practical Teutonic sagacity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to
take care of it in its difficulties, and was rather angry with it for
being so unfitted to take care of itself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) let the men talk, and with careless disdain of their discussions
and their certainties she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) business of preparation. At
this period, overworked and harassed by novel responsibilities and
risks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was happier, for days together, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had ever been,
simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a purpose in life and was depending upon
herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ignorance of the military and political situation was
complete; the situation did not interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). What interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had three men to feed wholly or partially, and that the price
of eatables was rising. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bought eatables. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bought fifty pecks of
potatoes at a franc a peck, and another fifty pecks at a franc and a
quarter--double the normal price; ten hams at two and a half francs a
pound; a large quantity of tinned vegetables and fruits, a sack of
flour, rice, biscuits, coffee, Lyons sausage, dried prunes, dried figs,
and much wood and charcoal. But the chief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) purchases was cheese,
of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother used to say that bread and cheese and water made a
complete diet. Many of these articles she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) obtained from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grocer. All
of them, except the flour and the biscuits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stored in the cellar
belonging to the flat; after several days' delay, for the Parisian
workmen were too elated by the advent of a republic to stoop to labour,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) caused a new lock to be fixed on the cellar-door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) activities
were the sensation of the house. Everybody admired, but no one imitated.

<p/>One morning, on going to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marketing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found a notice across
the shuttered windows of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) creamery in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette:
<div class="bookquote">``Closed for want of milk.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dame</b></font>)</div>The siege had begun. It was in the closing
of the creamery that the siege was figured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); in this, and in
eggs at five sous a piece. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went elsewhere for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) milk and paid a
franc a litre for it. That evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lodgers that the price
of meals would be doubled, and that if any gentleman thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
could get equally good meals elsewhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was at liberty to get them
elsewhere. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) position was strengthened by the appearance of another
candidate for a room, a friend of Niepce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at once offered him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
own room, at a hundred and fifty francs a month.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there is a piano in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't play the piano,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man protested, shocked at the price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agreed to pay the price demanded for the room because of the
opportunity of getting good meals much cheaper than in the restaurants.
Like M. Niepce, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``siege-widower,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife having been put
under shelter in Brittany. Sophia took to the servant's bedroom on the
sixth floor. It measured nine feet by seven, and had no window save a
skylight; but Sophia was in a fair way to realize a profit of at least
four pounds a week, after paying for everything.

<p/>On the night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) installed herself in that chamber, amid a world
of domestics and poor people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) worked very late, and the rays of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
candles shot up intermittently through the skylight into a black
heaven; at intervals she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flitted up and down the stairs with a candle.
Unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a crowd gradually formed opposite the house in the
street, and at about one o'clock in the morning a file of soldiers woke
the concierge and invaded the courtyard, and every window was suddenly
populated with heads. Sophia was called upon to prove that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not
a spy signalling to the Prussians. Three quarters of an hour passed
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) innocence was established and the staircases cleared of
uniforms and dishevelled curiosity. The childish, impossible unreason
of the suspicion against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) completed in Sophia's mind the ruin of the
reputation of the French people as a sensible race. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was extremely
caustic the next day to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) boarders. Except for this episode, the
frequency of military uniforms in the streets, the price of food, and
the fact that at least one house in four was flying either the
ambulance flag or the flag of a foreign embassy -LRB-in an absurd hope of
immunity from the impending bombardment-RRB- the siege did not exist for
Sophia. The men often talked about their guard-duty, and disappeared
for a day or two to the ramparts, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was too busy to listen to
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought of nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) enterprise, which absorbed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
powers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arose at six a.m., in the dark, and by seven-thirty M.
Niepce and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) friend had been served with breakfast, and much general
work was already done. At eight o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went out to market. When
asked why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) continued to buy at a high price, articles of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had a store, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would reply: <div class="bookquote">``I am keeping all that till things are
much dearer.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This was regarded as astounding astuteness.

<p/>On the fifteenth of October she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paid the quarter's rent of the flat,
four hundred francs, and was accepted as tenant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ears were soon
quite accustomed to the sound of cannon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
always been a citizeness of Paris, and that Paris had always been
besieged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not speculate about the end of the siege; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lived
from day to day. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a qualm of fear, when the firing
grew momentarily louder, or when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard that battles had been fought
in such and such a suburb. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said it was absurd to be afraid
when you were with a couple of million people, all in the same plight
as yourself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grew reconciled to everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) even began to like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tiny bedroom, partly because it was so easy to keep warm -LRB-the
question of artificial heat was growing acute in Paris-RRB-, and partly
because it ensured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) privacy. Down in the flat, whatever was done or
said in one room could be more or less heard in all the others, owing
to the prevalence of doors.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) existence, in the first half of November, had become regular with a
monotony almost absolute. Only the number of meals served to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
boarders varied slightly from day to day. All these repasts, save now
and then one in the evening, were carried into the bedrooms by the
charwoman. Sophia did not allow herself to be seen much, except in the
afternoons. Though Sophia continued to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) prices, and was now
selling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stores at an immense profit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) never approached the
prices current outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was very indignant against the exploitation
of Paris by its shopkeepers, who had vast supplies of provender, and
were hoarding for the rise. But the force of their example was too
great for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to ignore it entirely; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) contented herself with about
half their gains. Only to M. Niepce did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) charge more than to the
others, because he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was a shopkeeper. The four men appreciated their
paradise. In them developed that agreeable feeling of security which
solitary males find only under the roof of a landlady who is at once
prompt, honest, and a votary of cleanliness. Sophia hung a slate near
the frontdoor, and on this slate they wrote their requests for meals,
for being called, for laundry-work, etc.. Sophia never made a mistake,
and never forgot. The perfection of the domestic machine amazed these
men, who had been accustomed to something quite different, and who
every day heard harrowing stories of discomfort and swindling from
their acquaintances. They even admired Sophia for making them pay, if
not too high, still high. They thought it wonderful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should
tell them the price of all things in advance, and even show them how to
avoid expense, particularly in the matter of warmth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arranged rugs
for each of them, so that they could sit comfortably in their rooms
with nothing but a small charcoal heater for the hands. Quite naturally
they came to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as the paragon and miracle of women. They
endowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with every fine quality. According to them there had never
been such a woman in the history of mankind; there could not have been!
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) became legendary among their friends: a young and elegant creature,
surpassingly beautiful, proud, queenly, unapproachable, scarcely
visible, a marvellous manager, a fine cook and artificer of strange
English dishes, utterly reliable, utterly exact and with habits of
order...! They adored the slight English accent which gave a touch of
the exotic to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very correct and freely idiomatic French. In short,
Sophia was perfect for them, an impossible woman. Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did was
right.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) room every night with limbs exhausted, but with
head clear enough to balance her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) accounts and go through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
did this in bed with thick gloves on. If often she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not sleep well,
it was not because of the distant guns, but because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
preoccupation with the subject of finance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was making money, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to make more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was always inventing ways of economy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was so anxious to achieve independence that money was always in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began to love gold, to love hoarding it, and to hate paying
it away.

<p/>One morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) charwoman, who by good fortune was nearly as precise as
Sophia herself, failed to appear. When the moment came for serving M.
Niepce's breakfast, Sophia hesitated, and then decided to look after
the old man personally. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door, and went boldly in
with the tray and candle. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started at seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was wearing a
blue apron, as the charwoman did, but there could be no mistaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
for the charwoman. Niepce looked older in bed than when dressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
a rather ridiculous, undignified appearance, common among old men
before their morning toilette is achieved; and a nightcap did not
improve it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rotund paunch lifted the bedclothes, upon which, for
the sake of extra warmth, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spread unmajestic garments. Sophia
smiled to herself; but the contempt implied by that secret smile was
softened by the thought: <div class="bookquote">``Poor old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) briefly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
supposed the charwoman to be ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coughed and moved nervously. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
benevolent and simple face beamed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paternally as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fixed the
tray by the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really must open the window for one little second,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, and
did so. The chill air of the street came through the closed shutters,
and the old man made a noise as of shivering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pushed back the
shutters, and closed the window, and then did the same with the other
two windows. It was almost day in the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will no longer need the candle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, and came back to the
bedside to extinguish it.

<p/>The benign and fatherly old man put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) waist. Fresh from
the tonic of pure air, and with the notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ridiculousness still
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was staggered for an instant by this gesture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
never given a thought to the temperament of the old grocer, the husband
of a young wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not always imaginatively keep in mind the
effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own radiance, especially under such circumstances. But
after an instant her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) precocious cynicism, which had slept, sprang up.
<div class="bookquote">``Naturally! I might have expected it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought with blasting scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take away your hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said bitterly to the amiable old fool. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
did not stir.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) obeyed, sheepishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to remain with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did not
immediately answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said in a most commanding tone: <div class="bookquote">``Answer, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said feebly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, behave properly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wished only--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) stammered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to know what you wished,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/>Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wondered how much of the incident had been overheard.
The other breakfasts she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) left outside the respective doors; and in
future Niepce's also.

<p/>The charwoman never came again. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had caught smallpox and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) died of
it, thus losing a good situation. Strange to say, Sophia did not
replace her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); the temptation to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wages and food was too strong.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not, however, stand waiting for hours at the door of the
official baker and the official butcher, one of a long line of frozen
women, for the daily rations of bread and tri-weekly rations of meat.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) employed the concierge's boy, at two sous an hour, to do this.
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would come in with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands so blue and cold that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
could scarcely hold the precious cards which gave the right to the
rations and which cost Chirac an hour or two of waiting at the mayoral
offices each week. Sophia might have fed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flock without resorting to
the official rations, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not sacrifice the economy which
they represented. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demanded thick clothes for the concierge's boy,
and received boots from Chirac, gloves from Carlier, and a great
overcoat from Niepce. The weather increased in severity, and provisions
in price. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sold to the wife of a chemist who lived on the
first floor, for a hundred and ten francs, a ham for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had paid
less than thirty francs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of a thrill of joy in
receiving a beautiful banknote and a gold coin in exchange for a mere
ham. By this time her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) total cash resources had grown to nearly five
thousand francs. It was astounding. And the reserves in the cellar were
still considerable, and the sack of flour that encumbered the kitchen
was still more than half full. The death of the faithful charwoman,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard of it, produced but little effect on Sophia, who was so
overworked and so completely absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own affairs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
no nervous energy to spare for sentimental regrets. The charwoman, by
whose side she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had regularly passed many hours in the kitchen, so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew every crease in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face and fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dress, vanished out
of Sophia's memory.

<p/>Sophia cleaned and arranged two of the bedrooms in the morning, and two
in the afternoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had stayed in hotels where fifteen bedrooms were
in charge of a single chambermaid, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought it would be hard if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not manage four in the intervals of cooking and other work!
This she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to herself by way of excuse for not engaging another
charwoman. One afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was rubbing the brass knobs of the
numerous doors in M. Niepce's room, when the grocer unexpectedly came
in.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) sharply. There was a self-conscious look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) eye.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) had entered the flat noiselessly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered having told him (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>), in
response to a question, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) now did his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) room in the afternoon. Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) have left his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) shop? He (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) hat behind the door, with
the meticulous care of an old man. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) overcoat and
rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do well to wear gloves, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is dog's weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wear them for the cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I wear them so as not
to spoil my hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! truly! Very well! Very well! May I demand some wood? Where shall I
find it? I do not wish to derange you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) help, and brought wood from the kitchen, counting the
logs audibly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I light the fire now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will light it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a match, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was arranging the wood and paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Madame, will you
listen to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Have I not proved that I am capable of
respecting you? I continue in that respect. It is with all that respect
that I say to you that I love you, madame... No, remain calm, I
implore you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>The fact was that Sophia showed no sign of not remaining
calm. <div class="bookquote">``It is true that I have a wife. But what do you wish...? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is
far away. I love you madly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) proceeded with dignified respect. <div class="bookquote">``I
know I am old; but I am rich. I understand your character. You are a
lady, you are decided, direct, sincere, and a woman of business. I have
the greatest respect for you. One can talk to you as one could not to
another woman. You prefer directness and sincerity. Madame, I will give
you two thousand francs a month, and all you require from my shop, if
you will be amiable to me. I am very solitary, I need the society of a
charming creature who would be sympathetic. Two thousand francs a
month. It is money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) shiny head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Sophia was bending over the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could count on my discretion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) said in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I
appreciate your scruples. I would come, very late, to your room on the
sixth. One could arrange ... You see, I am direct, like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had an impulse to order him (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) tempestuously out of the flat; but it
was not a genuine impulse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) was an old fool. Why not treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) as
such? To take him (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) seriously would be absurd. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) was a very
remunerative boarder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said with cruel tranquillity. <div class="bookquote">``Do not be an old
fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lecher</b></font>)</div><p/>And the benign but fatuous middle-aged lecher saw the enchanting vision
of Sophia, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) natty apron and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) amusing gloves, sweep and fade
from the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>lecher</b></font>) left the house, and the expensive fire warmed an
empty room.

<p/>Sophia was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>lecher</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lecher</b></font>) had evidently planned the proposal. If
capable of respect, he (<font color='blue'><b>lecher</b></font>) was evidently also capable of chicane. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
supposed these Frenchmen were all alike: disgusting; and decided that
it was useless to worry over a universal fact. They had simply no
shame, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been very prudent to establish herself far away on
the sixth floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hoped that none of the other boarders had
overheard Niepce's outrageous insolence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not sure if Chirac was
not writing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) room.

<p/>That night there was no sound of cannon in the distance, and Sophia for
some time was unable to sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) woke up with a start, after a doze,
and struck a match to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) watch. It had stopped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
forgotten to wind it up, which omission indicated that the grocer had
perturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not be sure how long she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had slept. The hour might be two o'clock or it might be six o'clock.
Impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to rest! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) got up and dressed -LRB-in case it should
be as late as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feared-RRB- and crept down the interminable creaking
stairs with the candle. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) descended, the conviction that it was
the middle of the night grew upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stepped more softly.
There was no sound save that caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) footfalls. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) latchkey
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cautiously opened the front door of the flat and entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
then hear the noisy ticking of the small, cheap clock in the kitchen.
At the same moment another door creaked, and Chirac, with hair all
tousled, but fully dressed, appeared in the corridor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have decided to sell yourself to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac whispered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) drew away instinctively, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could feel herself blushing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was at a loss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that Chirac was in a furious rage, tremendously
moved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) crept towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), half crouching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never seen
anything so theatrical as his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) movement, and the twitching of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) too ought to be theatrical, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ought nobly to
scorn his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) infamous suggestion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) unwarrantable attack. Even supposing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had decided to sell herself to the old pasha, did that concern
him (<font color='blue'><b>pasha</b></font>)? A dignified silence, an annihilating glance, were all that he (<font color='blue'><b>pasha</b></font>)
deserved. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not capable of this heroic behaviour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) added weakly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac sneered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot to wind up my watch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And so I came down to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In effect!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) spoke sarcastically, as if saying: <div class="bookquote">``I've waited for
you, and here you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) nothing, but all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) were the only young people in that flat, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did owe to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) the proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was guiltless of the supreme
dishonour of youth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) forces and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should be ashamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You will wake the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And M. Niepce--will he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) need to be wakened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``M. Niepce is not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>Niepce's door was unlatched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pushed it open, and went into the
room, which was empty and bore no sign of having been used.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and satisfy yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) insisted.

<p/>Chirac did so. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) face fell.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) watch from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now wind my watch, and set it, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was in anguish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could not take the watch. Tears came
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) eyes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) face, and dashed away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard a
sob-impeded murmur that sounded like, <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and the banging of
a door. And in the stillness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard the regular snoring of M.
Carlier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) too cried. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) vision was blurred by a mist, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
stumbled into the kitchen and seized the clock, and carried it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
upstairs, and shivered in the intense cold of the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wept
gently for a very long time. <div class="bookquote">``What a shame! What a shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to
herself. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not quite blame Chirac. The frost drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into
bed, but not to sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) continued to cry. At dawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes were
inflamed with weeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was back in the kitchen then. Chirac's door
was wide open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had left the flat. On the slate was written, <div class="bookquote">``I shall
not take meals to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>III

<p/>Their relations were permanently changed. For several days they did not
meet at all; and when at the end of the week Chirac was obliged at last
to face Sophia in order to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) bill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had a most grievous
expression. It was obvious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) considered himself a criminal
without any defence to offer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) crime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) seemed to make no
attempt to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) state of mind. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said nothing. As for Sophia,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) preserved a mien of amiable cheerfulness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exerted herself to
convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attitude that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bore no resentment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
determined to forget the incident, that in short she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the forgiving
angel of his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) dreams. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not, however, succeed entirely in being
quite natural. Confronted by his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) misery, it would have been impossible
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to be quite natural, and at the same time quite cheerful!

<p/>A little later the social atmosphere of the flat began to grow
querulous, disputatious and perverse. The nerves of everybody were
seriously strained. This applied to the whole city. Days of heavy rains
followed the sharp frosts, and the town was, as it were, sodden with
woe. The gates were closed. And though nine-tenths of the inhabitants
never went outside the gates, the definite and absolute closing of them
demoralized all hearts. Gas was no longer supplied. Rats, cats, and
thorough-bred horses were being eaten and pronounced `not bad.'' The
siege had ceased to be a novelty. Friends did not invite one another to
a `siege-dinner' as to a picnic. Sophia, fatigued by regular overwork,
became weary of the situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was angry with the Prussians for
dilatoriness, and with the French for inaction, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) poured out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
English spleen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) boarders. The boarders told each other in secret
that the patronne was growing formidable. Chiefly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bore a grudge
against the shopkeepers; and when, upon a rumour of peace, the
shop-windows one day suddenly blossomed with prodigious quantities of
all edibles, at highest prices, thus proving that the famine was
artificially created, Sophia was furious. M. Niepce in particular,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Niepce</b></font>) sold goods to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at a special discount, suffered
indignities. A few days later that benign and fatherly man put himself
lamentably in the wrong by attempting to introduce into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room a
charming young creature who knew how to be sympathetic. Sophia, by an
accident unfortunate for the grocer, caught them in the corridor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was beside herself, but the only outward symptoms were a white face and
a cold steely voice that grated like a rasp on the susceptibilities of
the adherents of Aphrodite. At this period Sophia had certainly
developed into a termagant--without knowing it!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would often insist now on talking about the siege, and hearing
everything that the men could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) comments, made without the
least regard for the justifiable delicacy of their feelings as
Frenchmen, sometimes led to heated exchanges. When all Montmartre and
the Quartier Breda was impassioned by the appearance from outside of
the Thirty-second battalion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) took the side of the populace, and
would not credit the solemn statement of the journalists, proved by
documents, that these maltreated soldiers were not cowards in flight.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) supported the women who had spit in the faces of the Thirty-second.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) actually said that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had met them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have spit too.
Really, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was convinced of the innocence of the Thirty-second, but
something prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from admitting it. The dispute ended with high
words between herself and Chirac.

<p/>The next day Chirac came home at an unusual hour, knocked at the
kitchen door, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must give notice to leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) demanded curtly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was kneading flour and water for a potato-cake. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) potato-cakes
were the joy of the household.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My paper has stopped!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) added thoughtfully, but not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That is no
reason why you should leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``This place is beyond my means. I do not need to tell
you that in ceasing to appear the paper has omitted to pay its debts.
The house owes me a month's salary. So I must leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``You can pay me when you have money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I have no intention of accepting your kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you got any money?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) abruptly asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is the disaster--quite simply!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will be forced to get into debt somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but not here! Not to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, Chirac,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed, with a cajoling voice, <div class="bookquote">``you are not
reasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless it is like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said with decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) menacingly. <div class="bookquote">``It will not be like that!
You understand me? You will stay. And you will pay me when you can.
Otherwise we shall quarrel. Do you imagine I shall tolerate your
childishness? Just because you were angry last night--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) protested. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to know it is not that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``It is solely that I cannot permit myself to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cried peremptorily, stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). And then in a quieter
tone, <div class="bookquote">``And what about Carlier? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) also in the ditch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac, with sad envy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You also, one day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You stop--in any case until after
Christmas, or we quarrel. Is it agreed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) accent had softened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too good!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) yielded. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot quarrel with you. But it
pains me to accept--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) snapped, dropping into the vulgar idiom, <div class="bookquote">``you make me sweat
with your stupid pride. Is it that that you call friendship? Go away
now. How do you wish that I should succeed with this cake while you
station yourself there to distract me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>IV

<p/>But in three days' Chirac, with amazing luck, fell into another
situation, and on the Journal des Debats. It was the Prussians who had
found him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) a place. The celebrated Payenneville, second greatest
chroniqueur of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) time, had caught a cold while doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) duty as a
national guard, and had died of pneumonia. The weather was severe
again; soldiers were being frozen to death at Aubervilliers.
Payenneville's position was taken by another man, whose post was
offered to Chirac. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) told Sophia of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) good fortune with unconcealed
vanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You with your smile!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``One can refuse you
nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) behaved just as though Chirac had disgusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) humbled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).
But with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) fellow-lodgers his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) airs of importance as a member of the
editorial staff of the Debats were comical in their ingenuousness. On
the very same day Carlier gave notice to leave Sophia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was
comparatively rich; but the habits which had enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) to arrive at
independence in the uncertain vocation of a journalist would not allow
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was earning nothing, to spend a sou more than was
absolutely necessary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had decided to join forces with a widowed
sister, who was accustomed to parsimony as parsimony is understood in
France, and who was living on hoarded potatoes and wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``you have lost me a tenant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) insisted, half jocularly and half seriously, that Carlier was
leaving because he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could not stand Chirac's infantile conceit. The flat
was full of acrimonious words.

<p/>On Christmas morning Chirac lay in bed rather late; the newspapers did
not appear that day. Paris seemed to be in a sort of stupor. About
eleven o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) came to the kitchen door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) tone impressed Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) went in, and closed the door like a conspirator. <div class="bookquote">``We must have a
little fete,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fete!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``What an idea! How can I leave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If the idea had not appealed to the secrecies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart, stirring
desires and souvenirs upon which the dust of time lay thick, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
not have begun by suggesting difficulties; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have begun by a
flat refusal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said vigorously. <div class="bookquote">``It is Christmas, and I must
have a chat with you. We cannot chat here. I have not had a true little
chat with you since you were ill. You will come with me to a restaurant
for lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``And the lunch of my lodgers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will serve it a little earlier. We will go out immediately
afterwards, and we will return in time for you to prepare dinner. It is
quite simple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You are mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is necessary that I should offer you something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) went on
scowling. <div class="bookquote">``You comprehend me? I wish you to lunch with me to-day. I
demand it, and you are not going to refuse me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was very close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in the little kitchen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) spoke fiercely,
bullyingly, exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) when insisting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
should live on credit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very rude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) parried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I am rude, it is all the same to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) held out uncompromisingly.
<div class="bookquote">``You will lunch with me; I hold to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I be dressed?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That does not concern me. Arrange that as you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the most curious invitation to a Christmas dinner imaginable.

<p/>At a quarter past twelve they issued forth side by side, heavily clad,
into the mournful streets. The sky, slate-coloured, presaged snow. The
air was bitterly cold, and yet damp. There were no fiacres in the
little three-cornered place which forms the mouth of the Rue Clausel.
In the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, a single empty omnibus was toiling up
the steep glassy slope, the horses slipping and recovering themselves
in response to the whip-cracking, which sounded in the streets as in an
empty vault. Higher up, in the Rue Fontaine, one of the few shops that
were open displayed this announcement: <div class="bookquote">``A large selection of cheeses
for New Year's gifts.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rue Fontaine</b></font>)</div>They laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Last year at this moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac, <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of only one
thing--the masked ball at the opera. I could not sleep after it. This
year even the churches, are not open. And you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) lips together. <div class="bookquote">``Do not ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) said.

<p/>They proceeded in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are triste, we others,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But the Prussians, in their
trenches, they cannot be so gay, either! Their families and their
Christmas trees must be lacking to them. Let us laugh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Place Blanche</b></font>)</div><p/>The Place Blanche and the Boulevard de Clichy were no more lively than
the lesser streets and squares. There was no life anywhere, scarcely a
sound; not even the sound of cannon. Nobody knew anything; Christmas
had put the city into a lugubrious trance of hopelessness. Chirac took
Sophia's arm across the Place Blanche, and a few yards up the Rue Lepic
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) stopped at a small restaurant, famous among the initiated, and known
as <div class="bookquote">``The Little Louis.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They entered, descending by two steps into a
confined and sombrely picturesque interior.

<p/>Sophia saw that they were expected. Chirac must have paid a previous
visit to the restaurant that morning. Several disordered tables showed
that people had already lunched, and left; but in the corner was a
table for two, freshly laid in the best manner of such restaurants;
that is to say, with a red-and-white checked cloth, and two other
red-and-white cloths, almost as large as the table-cloth, folded as
serviettes and arranged flat on two thick plates between solid steel
cutlery; a salt-cellar, out of which one ground rock-salt by turning a
handle, a pepper-castor, two knife-rests, and two common tumblers. The
phenomena which differentiated this table from the ordinary table were
a champagne bottle and a couple of champagne glasses. Champagne was one
of the few items which had not increased in price during the siege.

<p/>The landlord and his (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) wife were eating in another corner, a fat,
slatternly pair, whom no privations of a siege could have emaciated.
The landlord rose. He (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) was dressed as a chef, all in white, with the
sacred cap; but a soiled white. Everything in the place was untidy,
unkempt and more or less unclean, except just the table upon which
champagne was waiting. And yet the restaurant was agreeable,
reassuring. The landlord greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) customers as honest friends. His (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>)
greasy face was honest, and so was the pale, weary, humorous face of
his (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) wife. Chirac saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), across from the other corner, indicating a bone on
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) plate. <div class="bookquote">``This is Diane!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! the poor animal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Chirac, sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady. <div class="bookquote">``It cost too dear to feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Diane</b></font>). And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Diane</b></font>) was so mignonne! One could not watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Diane</b></font>) grow thin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was saying to my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the landlord put in, <div class="bookquote">``how she (<font color='blue'><b>Diane</b></font>) would have
enjoyed that bone--Diane!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) roared with laughter.

<p/>Sophia and the landlady exchanged a curious sad smile at this
pleasantry, which had been re-discovered by the landlord for perhaps
the thousandth time during the siege, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) evidently regarded
as quite new and original.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) continued confidentially to Chirac. <div class="bookquote">``I have found for
you something very good--half a duck.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And in a still lower tone: <div class="bookquote">``And
it will not cost you too dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No attempt to realize more than a modest profit was ever made in that
restaurant. It possessed a regular clientele who knew the value of the
little money they had, and who knew also how to appreciate sincere and
accomplished cookery. The landlord was the chef, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chef</b></font>) was always
referred to as the chef, even by his (<font color='blue'><b>chef</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you get that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, mysteriously. <div class="bookquote">``I have one of my friends, who
comes from Villeneuve St. Georges--refugee, you know. In fine ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>A
wave of the fat hands, suggesting that Chirac should not inquire too
closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In effect!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac commented. <div class="bookquote">``But it is very chic, that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you that it is chic!''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady, sturdily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia murmured politely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then a quite little salad!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that--that is still more striking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>said Chirac.

<p/>The landlord winked. The fact was that the commerce which resulted in
fresh green vegetables in the heart of a beleagured town was notorious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then also a quite little cheese!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, slightly imitating
the tone of the landlord, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) drew from the inwardness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cloak
a small round parcel. It contained a Brie cheese, in fairly good
condition. It was worth at least fifty francs, and it had cost Sophia
less than two francs. The landlady joined the landlord in inspecting
this wondrous jewel. Sophia seized a knife and cut a slice for the
landlady's table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame is too good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady, confused by this noble
generosity, and bearing the gift off to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) table as a fox-terrier will
hurriedly seek solitude with a sumptuous morsel. The landlord beamed.
Chirac was enchanted. In the intimate and unaffected cosiness of that
interior the vast, stupefied melancholy of the city seemed to be
forgotten, to have lost its sway.

<p/>Then the landlord brought a hot brick for the feet of madame. It was
more an acknowledgment of the slice of cheese than a necessity, for the
restaurant was very warm; the tiny kitchen opened directly into it, and
the door between the two was open; there was no ventilation whatever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a friend of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, proudly, in the way of
gossip as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) served an undescribed soup, <div class="bookquote">``a butcher in the Faubourg St.
Honore, who has bought the three elephants of the Jardin des Plantes
for twenty-seven thousand francs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Eyebrows were lifted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) uncorked the champagne.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) drank the first mouthful -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had long lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) youthful
aversion for wine-RRB-, Sophia had a glimpse of herself in a tilted mirror
hung rather high on the opposite wall. It was several months since she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had attired herself with ceremoniousness. The sudden unexpected vision
of elegance and pallid beauty pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And the instant effect of
the champagne was to renew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind a forgotten conception of the
goodness of life and of the joys which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had so long missed.

<p/>V

<p/>At half-past two they were alone in the little salon of the restaurant,
and vaguely in their dreamy and feverish minds that were too
preoccupied to control with precision their warm, relaxed bodies, there
floated the illusion that the restaurant belonged to them and that in
it they were at home. It was no longer a restaurant, but a retreat and
shelter from hard life. The chef and his (<font color='blue'><b>chef</b></font>) wife were dozing in an inner
room. The champagne was drunk; the adorable cheese was eaten; and they
were sipping Marc de Bourgogne. They sat at right angles to one
another, close to one another, with brains aswing; full of good nature
and quick sympathy; their flesh content and yet expectant. In a pause
of the conversation -LRB-which, entirely banal and fragmentary, had seemed
to reach the acme of agreeableness-RRB-, Chirac put his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hand on the hand of
Sophia as it rested limp on the littered table. Accidentally she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) caught
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) eye; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not meant to do so. They both became self-conscious.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) thin, bearded face had more than ever that wistfulness which always
softened towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) the uncompromisingness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) character. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had
the look of a child. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), Gerald had sometimes shown the same look.
But indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was now one of those women for whom all men, and
especially all men in a tender mood, are invested with a certain
incurable quality of childishness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not withdrawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand at
once, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not withdraw it at all.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with timid audacity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes were liquid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was asking myself what I should have done if you had refused to
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what SHOULD you have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly something terribly inconvenient,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) replied, with the large
importance of a man who is in the domain of pure supposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) leaned
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My very dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) said in a different voice,
getting bolder.

<p/>It was infinitely sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), voluptuously sweet, this basking in the
heat of temptation. It certainly did seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), then, the one real
pleasure in the world. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body might have been saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``See how
ready I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body might have been saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Look into my
mind. For you I have no modesty. Look and see all that is there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
veil of convention seemed to have been rent. Their attitude to each
other was almost that of lover and mistress, between whom a single
glance may be charged with the secrets of the past and promises for the
future. Morally she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mistress in that moment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) released her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hand and put his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) whispered with great emotion.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face changed and hardened. <div class="bookquote">``You must not do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said,
coldly, unkindly, harshly. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) scowled. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would not abate one crease
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) forehead to the appeal of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) surprised glance. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did not
want to repulse him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). The instinct which repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was not within her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
control. Just as a shy man will obstinately refuse an invitation which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is hungering to accept, so, though not from shyness, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was
compelled to repulse Chirac. Perhaps if her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) desires had not been laid
to sleep by excessive physical industry and nervous strain, the sequel
might have been different.

<p/>Chirac, like most men who have once found a woman weak, imagined that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) understood women profoundly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) thought of women as the Occidental
thinks of the Chinese, as a race apart, mysterious but capable of being
infallibly comprehended by the application of a few leading principles
of psychology. Moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was in earnest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was hard driven, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
was honest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) continued, respectfully obedient in withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) arm:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) urged with undaunted confidence, <div class="bookquote">``you must know
that I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head impatiently, all the time wondering what it was that
prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from slipping into his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) badly by this brusque change of front; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not
help it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to feel sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been very good friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have always admired you
enormously. I did not think that I should dare to love you until that
day when I overheard that old villain Niepce make his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) advances. Then,
when I perceived my acute jealousy, I knew that I was loving you. Ever
since, I have thought only of you. I swear to you that if you will not
belong to me, it is already finished for me! Altogether! Never have I
seen a woman like you! So strong, so proud, so kind, and so beautiful!
You are astonishing, yes, astonishing! No other woman could have drawn
herself out of an impossible situation as you have done, since the
disappearance of your husband. For me, you are a woman unique. I am
very sincere. Besides, you know it ... Dear friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head passionately.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was moved. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted to yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), only liking him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), and to love afterwards.
But this obstinate instinct held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``I do not say, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac
went on. <div class="bookquote">``Let me hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The Latin theatricality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) gestures and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) tone made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sorrowful
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Chirac!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plaintively murmured, and began to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
gloves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall hope!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) persisted.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) violently by the waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
face away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), firmly. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not hard, not angry now.
Disconcerted by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) compassion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) loosed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Chirac,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I ought not to have come. I must go. It is
perfectly useless. Believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) whispered fiercely.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood up and the abrupt movement pushed the table gratingly across
the floor. The throbbing spell of the flesh was snapped like a
stretched string, and the scene over. The landlord, roused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
doze, stumbled in. Chirac had nothing but the bill as a reward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
pains. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was baffled.

<p/>They left the restaurant, silently, with a foolish air.

<p/>Dusk was falling on the mournful streets, and the lamp-lighters were
lighting the miserable oil lamps that had replaced gas. They two, and
the lamplighters, and an omnibus were alone in the streets. The gloom
was awful; it was desolating. The universal silence seemed to be the
silence of despair. Steeped in woe, Sophia thought wearily upon the
hopeless problem of existence. For it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Chirac
had created this woe out of nothing, and yet it was an incurable woe!




<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>SUCCESS

<p/>I


<p/>Sophia lay awake one night in the room lately quitted by Carlier. That
silent negation of individuality had come and gone, and left scarcely
any record of himself either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) room or in the memories of those
who had surrounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) existence in the house. Sophia had decided to
descend from the sixth floor, partly because the temptation of a large
room, after months in a cubicle, was rather strong; but more because of
late she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been obliged to barricade the door of the cubicle with a
chest of drawers, owing to the propensities of a new tenant of the
sixth floor. It was useless to complain to the concierge; the sole
effective argument was the chest of drawers, and even that was frailer
than Sophia could have wished. Hence, finally, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) retreat.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard the front-door of the flat open; then it was shut with
nervous violence. The resonance of its closing would have certainly
wakened less accomplished sleepers than M. Niepce and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) friend, whose
snores continued with undisturbed regularity. After a pause of
shuffling, a match was struck, and feet crept across the corridor with
the most exaggerated precautions against noise. There followed the
unintentional bang of another door. It was decidedly the entry of a man
without the slightest natural aptitude for furtive irruptions. The
clock in M. Niepce's room, which the grocer had persuaded to exact
time-keeping, chimed three with its delicate ting.

<p/>For several days past Chirac had been mysteriously engaged very late at
the bureaux of the Debats. No one knew the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) employment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
said nothing, except to inform Sophia that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) would continue to come
home about three o'clock until further notice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had insisted on
leaving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) room the materials and apparatus for a light meal.
Naturally he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had protested, with the irrational obstinacy of a
physically weak man who sticks to it that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can defy the laws of
nature. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had protested in vain.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) general conduct since Christmas Day had frightened Sophia, in spite
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tendency to stifle facile alarms at their birth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had eaten
scarcely anything at all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went about with the face of a man
dying of a broken heart. The change in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was indeed tragic. And
instead of improving, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew worse. <div class="bookquote">``Have I done this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked
herself. <div class="bookquote">``It is impossible that I should have done this! It is absurd
and ridiculous that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) should behave so!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thoughts were employed
alternately in sympathizing with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and in despising him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in blaming
herself and in blaming him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). When they spoke, they spoke awkwardly, as
though one or both of them had committed a shameful crime, which could
not even be mentioned. The atmosphere of the flat was tainted by the
horror. And Sophia could not offer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a bowl of soup without wondering
how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) or avoid looking, and without carefully
arranging in advance her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own gestures and speech. Existence was a
nightmare of self-consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last they have unmasked their batteries!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had exclaimed with
painful gaiety two days after Christmas, when the besiegers had
recommenced their cannonade. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to imitate the strange, general
joy of the city, which had been roused from apathy by the recurrence of
a familiar noise; but the effort was a deplorable failure. And Sophia
condemned not merely the failure of Chirac's imitation, but the thing
imitated. <div class="bookquote">``Childish!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought. Yet, despise the feebleness of
Chirac's behaviour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was deeply impressed, genuinely
astonished, by the gravity and persistence of the symptoms. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) must
have been getting himself into a state about me for a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thought. <div class="bookquote">``Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could not have gone mad like this all in a day or
two! But I never noticed anything. No; honestly I never noticed
anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>And just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) behaviour in the restaurant had shaken
Chirac's confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) knowledge of the other sex, so now the
singular behaviour of Chirac shook hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was taken aback. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
frightened, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pretended not to be frightened.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had lived over and over again the scene in the restaurant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
asked herself over and over again if really she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not beforehand
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) to make love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in the restaurant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not
decide exactly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had begun to expect a declaration; but probably
a long time before the meal was finished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had foreseen it, and
might have stopped it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not chosen to stop it. Curiosity
concerning not merely him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), but also herself, had tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tacitly to
encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked herself over and over again why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as curious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). Was
it because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a married woman? Was it because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had moral
scruples? Was it at bottom because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)? Was it
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not care for anybody? Was it because his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) fervid
manner of love-making offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) English phlegm? And did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feel
pleased or displeased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) forbearance in not renewing the assault?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know.

<p/>But all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted love. Only, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) conceived a
different kind of love: placid, regular, somewhat stern, somewhat above
the plane of whims, moods, caresses, and all mere fleshly contacts. Not
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) despised these things -LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did-RRB-!
What she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted was a love that was too proud, too independent, to
exhibit frankly either its joy or its pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hated a display of
sentiment. And even in the most intimate abandonments she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have
made reserves, and would have expected reserves, trusting to a lover's
powers of divination, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own! The foundation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) character
was a haughty moral independence, and this quality was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) most
admired in others.

<p/>Chirac's inability to draw from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) own pride strength to sustain
himself against the blow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refusal gradually killed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the
sexual desire which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had aroused, and which during a few days
flickered up under the stimulus of fancy and of regret. Sophia saw with
increasing clearness that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) unreasoning instinct had been right in
saying him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) nay. And when, in spite of this, regrets still visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would comfort herself in thinking: <div class="bookquote">``I cannot be bothered with all
that sort of thing. It is not worth while. What does it lead to? Is not
life complicated enough without that? No, no! I will stay as I am. At
any rate I know what I am in for, as things are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would reflect
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hopeful financial situation, and the approaching prospect of a
constantly sufficient income. And a little thrill of impatience against
the interminable and gigantic foolishness of the siege would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) self-consciousness in presence of Chirac did not abate.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lay in bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) awaited accustomed sounds which should have
connoted Chirac's definite retirement for the night. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ear, however,
caught no sound whatever from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) room. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) imagined that there
was a smell of burning in the flat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat up, and sniffed anxiously,
of a sudden wideawake and apprehensive. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was sure that the
smell of burning was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) imagination. The bedroom was in perfect
darkness. Feverishly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) searched with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) right hand for the matches
on the night-table, and knocked candlestick and matches to the floor.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dressing-gown, which was spread over the bed, and put it
on, aiming for the door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feet were bare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) discovered the door.
In the passage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could discern nothing at first, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made
out a thin line of light, which indicated the bottom of Chirac's door.
The smell of burning was strong and unmistakable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went towards the
faint light, fumbled for the door-handle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) palm, and opened. It
did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to call out and ask what was the matter.

<p/>The house was not on fire; but it might have been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had left on the
table at the foot of Chirac's bed a small cooking-lamp, and a saucepan
of bouillon. All that Chirac had to do was to ignite the lamp and put
the saucepan on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had ignited the lamp, having previously raised
the double wicks, and had then dropped into the chair by the table just
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was, and sunk forward and gone to sleep with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) head lying
sideways on the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had not put the saucepan on the lamp; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had
not lowered the wicks, and the flames, capped with thick black smoke,
were waving slowly to and fro within a few inches of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) loose hair.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hat had rolled along the floor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) great overcoat
and one woollen glove; the other glove had lodged on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) slanting knee.
A candle was also burning.

<p/>Sophia hastened forward, as it were surreptitiously, and with a
forward-reaching movement turned down the wicks of the lamp; black
specks were falling on the table; happily the saucepan was covered, or
the bouillon would have been ruined.

<p/>Chirac made a heart-rending spectacle, and Sophia was aware of deep and
painful emotion in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) thus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) must have been utterly exhausted
and broken by loss of sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was a man incapable of regular hours,
incapable of treating his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) body with decency. Though going to bed at
three o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had continued to rise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) usual hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) looked
like one dead; but more sad, more wistful. Outside in the street a fog
reigned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) thin draggled beard was jewelled with the moisture of
it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) attitude had the unconsidered and violent prostration of an
overspent dog. The beaten animal in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was expressed in every detail
of that posture. It showed even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) white, drawn eyelids, and in the
falling of a finger. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) face was very sad. It appealed for mercy
as the undefended face of sleep always appeals; it was so helpless, so
exposed, so simple. It recalled Sophia to a sense of the inner
mysteries of life, reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) somehow that humanity walks ever on a
thin crust over terrific abysses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not physically shudder; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) soul shuddered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mechanically placed the saucepan on the lamp, and the noise
awakened Chirac. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) groaned. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) did not perceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
saw that some one was looking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) did not immediately
realize who this some one was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) fists,
exactly like a baby, and sat up, and the chair cracked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, madame, I ask pardon. What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have nearly destroyed the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I smelt fire, and I
came in. I was just in time. There is no danger now. But please be
careful.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made as if to move towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) eyelids wavering.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) explained.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) chair unsteadily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) to sit down again, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) obeyed as though in a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait one moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I ask pardon. I should not know how to
thank you. You are truly too good. Will you wait one moment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) tone was one of supplication. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), a little dazzled by
the light and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). The lamp and the candle illuminated the lower
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face, theatrically, and showed the texture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blue
flannel peignoir; the pattern of a part of the lace collar was
silhouetted in shadow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cheek. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face was flushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair
hung down unconfined. Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) could not recover from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) excusable
astonishment at the apparition of such a figure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it--now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. The faint, quizzical emphasis which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
put on the `now' indicated the essential of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought. The sight of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with a womanly sympathy. But that
sympathy was only the envelope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) disdain of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not
admire weakness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could but pity it with a pity in which scorn was
mingled. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) instinct was to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) as a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had failed in
human dignity. And it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not previously been
quite certain whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), but that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
quite certain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw the wounds of a soul that
could not hide its wounds, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) resented the sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was hard.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not make allowances. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) revelled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hardness.
Contempt--a good-natured, kindly, forgiving contempt--that was the
kernel of the sympathy which exteriorly warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! Contempt for the
lack of self-control which had resulted in this swift degeneration of a
man into a tortured victim! Contempt for the lack of perspective which
magnified a mere mushroom passion till it filled the whole field of
life! Contempt for this feminine slavery to sentiment! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have been able to give herself to Chirac as one gives a toy
to an infant. But of loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)...! No! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of an
immeasurable superiority to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of the freedom
of a strong mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am going away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of Paris? How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By balloon! My journal...! It is an affair of great importance. You
understand. I offered myself. What would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is dangerous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) observed, waiting to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) would put on the
silly air of one who does not understand fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>the poor fellow muttered with a fatuous intonation and snapping
of the fingers. <div class="bookquote">``That is all the same to me. Yes, it is dangerous. Yes,
it is dangerous!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``But what would you...? For me...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not mentioned danger. It hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
incurring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ironic disdain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be the night after to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``In the courtyard of
the Gare du Nord. I want you to come and see me go. I particularly want
you to come and see me go. I have asked Carlier to escort you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might have been saying, <div class="bookquote">``I am offering myself to martyrdom, and you
must assist at the spectacle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) yet more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Be tranquil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not worry you. Never shall I speak
to you again of my love. I know you. I know it would be useless. But I
hope you will come and wish me bon voyage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if you really wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) replied with cheerful coolness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand and kissed it.

<p/>Once it had pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not
like it. It seemed hysterical and foolish to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feet to
be stone-cold on the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Please eat your soup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) escaped, hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would not espy her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) feet.

<p/>II

<p/>The courtyard of the Nord Railway Station was lighted by oil-lamps
taken from locomotives; their silvered reflectors threw dazzling rays
from all sides on the under portion of the immense yellow mass of the
balloon; the upper portion was swaying to and fro with gigantic
ungainliness in the strong breeze. It was only a small balloon, as
balloons are measured, but it seemed monstrous as it wavered over the
human forms that were agitating themselves beneath it. The cordage was
silhouetted against the yellow taffetas as high up as the widest
diameter of the balloon, but above that all was vague, and even
spectators standing at a distance could not clearly separate the summit
of the great sphere from the darkly moving sky. The car, held by ropes
fastened to stakes, rose now and then a few inches uneasily from the
ground. The sombre and severe architecture of the station-buildings
enclosed the balloon on every hand; it had only one way of escape. Over
the roofs of that architecture, which shut out the sounds of the city,
came the irregular booming of the bombardment. Shells were falling in
the southern quarters of Paris, doing perhaps not a great deal of
damage, but still plunging occasionally into the midst of some domestic
interior and making a sad mess of it. The Parisians were convinced that
the shells were aimed maliciously at hospitals and museums; and when a
child happened to be blown to pieces their unspoken comments upon the
Prussian savagery were bitter. Their faces said: <div class="bookquote">``Those barbarians
cannot even spare our children!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They amused themselves by creating a
market in shells, paying more for a live shell than a dead one, and
modifying the tariff according to the supply. And as the cattle-market
was empty, and the vegetable-market was empty, and beasts no longer
pastured on the grass of the parks, and the twenty-five million rats of
the metropolis were too numerous to furnish interest to spectators, and
the Bourse was practically deserted, the traffic in shells sustained
the starving mercantile instinct during a very dull period. But the
effect on the nerves was deleterious. The nerves of everybody were like
nothing but a raw wound. Violent anger would spring up magically out of
laughter, and blows out of caresses. This indirect consequence of the
bombardment was particularly noticeable in the group of men under the
balloon. Each behaved as if he (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) were controlling his (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) temper in the most
difficult circumstances. Constantly they all gazed upwards into the
sky, though nothing could possibly be distinguished there save the
blurred edge of a flying cloud. But the booming came from that sky; the
shells that were dropping on Montrouge came out of that sky; and the
balloon was going up into it; the balloon was ascending into its
mysteries, to brave its dangers, to sweep over the encircling ring of
fire and savages.

<p/>Sophia stood apart with Carlier. Carlier had indicated a particular
spot, under the shelter of the colonnade, where he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said it was
imperative that they should post themselves. Having guided Sophia to
this spot, and impressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that they were not to move, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed
to consider that the activity of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) role was finished, and spoke no
word. With the very high silk hat which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) always wore, and a thin
old-fashioned overcoat whose collar was turned up, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made a rather
grotesque figure. Fortunately the night was not very cold, or he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might
have passively frozen to death on the edge of that feverish group.
Sophia soon ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) watched the balloon. An aristocratic old
man leaned against the car, watch in hand; at intervals he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scowled, or
stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot. An old sailor, tranquilly smoking a pipe, walked
round and round the balloon, staring at it; once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) climbed up into the
rigging, and once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped into the car and angrily threw out of it a
bag, which some one had placed in it. But for the most part he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
calm. Other persons of authority hurried about, talking and
gesticulating; and a number of workmen waited idly for orders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Chirac?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>suddenly cried the old man with the watch.

<p/>Several voices deferentially answered, and a man ran away into the
gloom on an errand.

<p/>Then Chirac appeared, nervous, self-conscious, restless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was
enveloped in a fur coat that Sophia had never seen before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
carried dangling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hand a cage containing six pigeons whose
whiteness stirred uneasily within it. The sailor took the cage from him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
and all the persons of authority gathered round to inspect the
wonderful birds upon which, apparently, momentous affairs depended.
When the group separated, the sailor was to be seen bending over the
edge of the car to deposit the cage safely. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) then got into the car,
still smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) pipe, and perched himself negligently on the
wicker-work. The man with the watch was conversing with Chirac; Chirac
nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) head frequently in acquiescence, and seemed to be saying all
the time: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir! Perfectly sir! I understand, sir! Yes, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly Chirac turned to the car and put a question to the sailor, who
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) head. Whereupon Chirac gave a gesture of submissive despair
to the man with the watch. And in an instant the whole throng was in a
ferment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The victuals!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the man with the watch. <div class="bookquote">``The victuals, name of
God! Must one be indeed an idiot to forget the victuals! Name of
God--of God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia smiled at the agitation, and at the inefficient management which
had never thought of food. For it appeared that the food had not merely
been forgotten; it was a question which had not even been considered.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not help despising all that crowd of self-important and fussy
males to whom the idea had not occurred that even balloonists must eat.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered whether everything was done like that. After a delay
that seemed very long, the problem of victuals was solved, chiefly, as
far as Sophia could judge, by means of cakes of chocolate and bottles
of wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is enough! It is enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>Chirac shouted passionately several times
to a knot of men who began to argue with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>).

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) gazed round furtively, and with an inflation of the chest and a
patting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) fur coat he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) came directly towards Sophia. Evidently
Sophia's position had been prearranged between him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) and Carlier. They
could forget food, but they could think of Sophia's position!

<p/>All eyes followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>). Those eyes could not, in the gloom, distinguish
Sophia's beauty, but they could see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was young and slim and
elegant, and of foreign carriage. That was enough. The very air seemed
to vibrate with the intense curiosity of those eyes. And immediately
Chirac grew into the hero of some brilliant and romantic adventure.
Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was envied and admired by every man of authority
present. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)? Who was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)? Was it a serious passion or simply
a caprice? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flung herself at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)? It was undeniable that lovely
creatures did sometimes fling themselves at lucky mediocrities. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
a married woman? An artiste? A girl? Such queries thumped beneath
overcoats, while the correctness of a ceremonious demeanour was
strictly observed.

<p/>Chirac uncovered, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand. The wind disarranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hair.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) face was very pale and anxious beneath the swagger of
a sincere desire to be brave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is the moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you all forget the food?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``What will you? One cannot think of
everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will have a safe voyage,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had already taken leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) once, in the house, and heard all
about the balloon and the sailor-aeronaut and the preparations; and now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had nothing to say, nothing whatever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shoulders again. <div class="bookquote">``I hope so!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) murmured, but in a
tone to convey that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had no such hope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The wind isn't too strong?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) suggested.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) shoulders again. <div class="bookquote">``What would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it in the direction you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, nearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) admitted unwillingly. Then rousing himself: <div class="bookquote">``Eh,
well, madame. You have been extremely amiable to come. I held to it
very much--that you should come. It is because of you I quit Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) resented the speech by a frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) implored in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Do not do that. Smile on me. After
all, it is not my fault. Remember that this may be the last time I see
you, the last time I regard your eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was convinced of the genuineness of the emotion which
expressed itself in all this flamboyant behaviour. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had to make
excuses to herself on behalf of Chirac. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
pleasure. The hard commonsense in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might sneer, but indubitably she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was the centre of a romantic episode. The balloon darkly swinging
there! The men waiting! The secrecy of the mission! And Chirac,
bare-headed in the wind that was to whisk him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) away, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in
fatalistic accents that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) image had devastated his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) life, while
envious aspirants watched their colloquy! Yes, it was romantic. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was beautiful! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty was an active reality that went about the
world playing tricks in spite of herself. The thoughts that passed
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind were the large, splendid thoughts of romance. And it
was Chirac who had aroused them! A real drama existed, then, triumphing
over the accidental absurdities and pettinesses of the situation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
final words to Chirac were tender and encouraging.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hurried back to the balloon, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) cap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was received with
the respect due to one who comes fresh from conquest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) was sacred.

<p/>Sophia rejoined Carlier, who had withdrawn, and began to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
with a self-conscious garrulity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spoke without reason and scarcely
noticed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was saying. Already Chirac was snatched out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
life, as other beings, so many of them, had been snatched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought
of their first meetings, and of the sympathy which had always united
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) simplicity, now, in the self-created crisis of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) fate, and had sunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) esteem. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was determined to like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) all the more because he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) had sunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) esteem. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) really had undertaken this adventure from sentimental
disappointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered whether, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not forgotten to wind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) watch one night, they would still have been living quietly under
the same roof in the Rue Breda.

<p/>The sailor climbed definitely into the car; he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had covered himself with
a large cloak. Chirac had got one leg over the side of the car, and
eight men were standing by the ropes, when a horse's hoofs clattered
through the guarded entrance to the courtyard, amid an uproar of sudden
excitement. The shiny chest of the horse was flecked with the classic
foam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A telegram from the Governor of Paris!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>As the orderly, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) mount, approached the group, even the old
man with the watch raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) hat. The orderly responded, bent down to
make an inquiry, which Chirac answered, and then, with another exchange
of salutes, the official telegram was handed over to Chirac, and the
horse backed away from the crowd. It was quite thrilling. Carlier was
thrilled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) is never too prompt, the Governor. It is a quality!''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlier</b></font>)</div>said Carlier,
with irony.

<p/>Chirac entered the car. And then the old man with the watch drew a
black bag from the shadow behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) and entrusted it to Chirac, who
accepted it with a profound deference and hid it. The sailor began to
issue commands. The men at the ropes were bending down now. Suddenly
the balloon rose about a foot and trembled. The sailor continued to
shout. All the persons of authority gazed motionless at the balloon.
The moment of suspense was eternal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let go all!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div>cried the sailor, standing up, and clinging to the
cordage. Chirac was seated in the car, a mass of dark fur with a small
patch of white in it. The men at the ropes were a knot of struggling
confused figures.

<p/>One side of the car tilted up, and the sailor was nearly pitched out.
Three men at the other side had failed to free the ropes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let go, corpses!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div>the sailor yelled at them.

<p/>The balloon jumped, as if it were drawn by some terrific impulse from
the skies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Adieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chirac/Mr. Chirac</b></font>)</div>called Chirac, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) cap off and waving it. <div class="bookquote">``Adieu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bon voyage! Bon voyage!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the little crowd cheered. And then, <div class="bookquote">``Vive la
France!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Throats tightened, including Sophia's.

<p/>But the top of the balloon had leaned over, destroying its pear-shape,
and the whole mass swerved violently towards the wall of the station,
the car swinging under it like a toy, and an anchor under the car.
There was a cry of alarm. Then the great ball leaped again, and swept
over the high glass roof, escaping by inches the spouting. The cheers
expired instantly... The balloon was gone. It was spirited away as if
by some furious and mighty power that had grown impatient in waiting
for it. There remained for a few seconds on the collective retina of
the spectators a vision of the inclined car swinging near the roof like
the tail of a kite. And then nothing! Blankness! Blackness! Already the
balloon was lost to sight in the vast stormy ocean of the night, a
plaything of the winds. The spectators became once more aware of the
dull booming of the cannonade. The balloon was already perhaps flying
unseen amid the wrack over those guns.

<p/>Sophia involuntarily caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) breath. A chill sense of loneliness, of
purposelessness, numbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) being.

<p/>Nobody ever saw Chirac or the old sailor again. The sea must have
swallowed them. Of the sixty-five balloons that left Paris during the
siege, two were not heard of. This was the first of the two. Chirac
had, at any rate, not magnified the peril, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) intention was
undoubtedly to magnify it.

<p/>III

<p/>This was the end of Sophia's romantic adventures in France. Soon
afterwards the Germans entered Paris, by mutual agreement, and made a
point of seeing the Louvre, and departed, amid the silence of a city.
For Sophia the conclusion of the siege meant chiefly that prices went
down. Long before supplies from outside could reach Paris, the
shop-windows were suddenly full of goods which had arrived from the
shopkeepers alone knew where. Sophia, with the stock in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cellar,
could have held out for several weeks more, and it annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had not sold more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) good things while good things were worth gold.
The signing of a treaty at Versailles reduced the value of Sophia's two
remaining hams from about five pounds apiece to the usual price of
hams. However, at the end of January she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found herself in possession of
a capital of about eight thousand francs, all the furniture of the
flat, and a reputation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had earned it all. Nothing could destroy
the structure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beauty, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked worn and appreciably older.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered often when Chirac would return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have written to
Carlier or to the paper; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not. It was Niepce who discovered
in a newspaper that Chirac's balloon had miscarried. At the moment the
news did not affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at all; but after several days she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began to
feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loss in a dull sort of way; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt it more and more,
though never acutely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was perfectly convinced that Chirac could
never have attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) powerfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) continued to dream, at rare
intervals, of the kind of passion that would have satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
glowing but banked down like a fire in some fine chamber of a rich but
careful household.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was speculating upon what her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) future would be, and whether by
inertia she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was doomed to stay for ever in the Rue Breda, when the
Commune caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was more vexed than frightened by the Commune;
vexed that a city so in need of repose and industry should indulge in
such antics. For many people the Commune was a worse experience than
the siege; but not for Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a woman and a foreigner. Niepce
was infinitely more disturbed than Sophia; he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) went in fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) life.
Sophia would go out to market and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chances. It is true that
during one period the whole population of the house went to live in the
cellars, and orders to the butcher and other tradesmen were given over
the party-wall into the adjoining courtyard, which communicated with an
alley. A strange existence, and possibly perilous! But the women who
passed through it and had also passed through the siege, were not very
much intimidated by it, unless they happened to have husbands or lovers
who were active politicians.

<p/>Sophia did not cease, during the greater part of the year 1871, to make
a living and to save money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) watched every sou, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) developed a
tendency to demand from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tenants all that they could pay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
excused this to herself by ostentatiously declaring every detail of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
prices in advance. It came to the same thing in the end, with this
advantage, that the bills did not lead to unpleasantness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
difficulties commenced when Paris at last definitely resumed its normal
aspect and life, when all the women and children came back to those
city termini which they had left in such huddled, hysterical throngs,
when flats were re-opened that had long been shut, and men who for a
whole year had had the disadvantages and the advantages of being
without wife and family, anchored themselves once more to the hearth.
Then it was that Sophia failed to keep all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rooms let. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
have let them easily and constantly and at high rents; but not to men
without encumbrances. Nearly every day she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refused attractive tenants
in pretty hats, or agreeable gentlemen who only wanted a room on
condition that they might offer hospitality to a dashing petticoat. It
was useless to proclaim aloud that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) house was <div class="bookquote">``serious.''  (<font color='red'><b>the majority</b></font>)</div>The
ambition of the majority of these joyous persons was to live in a
`serious' house, because each was sure that at bottom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a
`serious' person, and quite different from the rest of the joyous
world. The character of Sophia's flat, instead of repelling the wrong
kind of aspirant, infallibly drew just that kind. Hope was
inextinguishable in these bosoms. They heard that there would be no
chance for them at Sophia's; but they tried nevertheless. And
occasionally Sophia would make a mistake, and grave unpleasantness
would occur before the mistake could be rectified. The fact was that
the street was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Few people would credit that there was
a serious boarding-house in the Rue Breda. The police themselves would
not credit it. And Sophia's beauty was against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). At that time the
Rue Breda was perhaps the most notorious street in the centre of Paris;
at the height of its reputation as a warren of individual
improprieties; most busily creating that prejudice against itself
which, over thirty years later, forced the authorities to change its
name in obedience to the wish of its tradesmen. When Sophia went out at
about eleven o'clock in the morning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reticule to buy, the
street was littered with women who had gone out with reticules to buy.
But whereas Sophia was fully dressed, and wore headgear, the others
were in dressing-gown and slippers, or opera-cloak and slippers, having
slid directly out of unspeakable beds and omitted to brush their hair
out of their puffy eyes. In the little shops of the Rue Breda, the Rue
Notre Dame de Lorette, and the Rue des Martyrs, you were very close
indeed to the primitive instincts of human nature. It was wonderful; it
was amusing; it was excitingly picturesque; and the universality of the
manners rendered moral indignation absurd. But the neighbourhood was
certainly not one in which a woman of Sophia's race, training, and
character, could comfortably earn a living, or even exist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could
not fight against the entire street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and not the street, was out
of place and in the wrong. Little wonder that the neighbours lifted
their shoulders when they spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)! What beautiful woman but a mad
Englishwoman would have had the idea of establishing herself in the Rue
Breda with the intention of living like a nun and compelling others to
do the same?

<p/>By dint of continual ingenuity, Sophia contrived to win somewhat more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) expenses, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was slowly driven to admit to herself that
the situation could not last.

<p/>Then one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw in Galignani's Messenger an advertisement of an
English pension for sale in the Rue Lord Byron, in the Champs Elysees
quarter. It belonged to some people named Frensham, and had enjoyed a
certain popularity before the war. The proprietor and his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) wife,
however, had not sufficiently allowed for the vicissitudes of politics
in Paris. Instead of saving money during their popularity they had put
it on the back and on the fingers of Mrs. Frensham. The siege and the
Commune had almost ruined them. With capital they might have restored
themselves to their former pride; but their capital was exhausted.
Sophia answered the advertisement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) impressed the Frenshams, who
were delighted with the prospect of dealing in business with an honest
English face. Like many English people abroad they were most strangely
obsessed by the notion that they had quitted an island of honest men to
live among thieves and robbers. They always implied that dishonesty was
unknown in Britain. They offered, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would take over the lease, to
sell all their furniture and their renown for ten thousand francs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
declined, the price seeming absurd to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). When they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to name
a price, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) preferred not to do so. Upon entreaty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
said four thousand francs. They then allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to see that they
considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to have been quite right in hesitating to name a price
so ridiculous. And their confidence in the honest English face seemed
to have been shocked. Sophia left. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) got back to the Rue Breda
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was relieved that the matter had come to nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not
precisely foresee what her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) future was to be, but at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shrank from the responsibility of the Pension Frensham. The next
morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) received a letter offering to accept six thousand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
wrote and declined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was indifferent and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not budge from
four thousand. The Frenshams gave way. They were pained, but they gave
way. The glitter of four thousand francs in cash, and freedom, was too
tempting.

<p/>Thus Sophia became the proprietress of the Pension Frensham in the cold
and correct Rue Lord Byron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made room in it for nearly all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
other furniture, so that instead of being under-furnished, as pensions
usually are, it was over-furnished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was extremely timid at first,
for the rent alone was four thousand francs a year; and the prices of
the quarter were alarmingly different from those of the Rue Breda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
lost a lot of sleep. For some nights, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been installed in
the Rue Lord Byron about a fortnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) scarcely slept at all, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ate no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) slept. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cut down expenditure to the very
lowest, and frequently walked over to the Rue Breda to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
marketing. With the aid of a charwoman at six sous an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
accomplished everything. And though clients were few, the feat was in
the nature of a miracle; for Sophia had to cook.

<p/>The articles which George Augustus Sala wrote under the title <div class="bookquote">``Paris
herself again''  (<font color='red'><b>Augustus</b></font>)</div>ought to have been paid for in gold by the hotel and
pension-keepers of Paris. They awakened English curiosity and the
desire to witness the scene of terrible events. Their effect was
immediately noticeable. In less than a year after her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustus</b></font>) adventurous
purchase, Sophia had acquired confidence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was employing two
servants, working them very hard at low wages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had also acquired
the landlady's manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was known as Mrs. Frensham. Across the
balconies of two windows the Frenshams had left a gilded sign, <div class="bookquote">``Pension
Frensham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>and Sophia had not removed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) often explained that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
name was not Frensham; but in vain. Every visitor inevitably and
persistently addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) according to the sign. It was past the
general comprehension that the proprietress of the Pension Frensham
might bear another name than Frensham. But later there came into being
a class of persons, habitues of the Pension Frensham, who knew the real
name of the proprietress and were proud of knowing it, and by this
knowledge were distinguished from the herd. What struck Sophia was the
astounding similarity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) guests. They all asked the same questions,
made the same exclamations, went out on the same excursions, returned
with the same judgments, and exhibited the same unimpaired assurance
that foreigners were really very peculiar people. They never seemed to
advance in knowledge. There was a constant stream of explorers from
England who had to be set on their way to the Louvre or the Bon Marche.

<p/>Sophia's sole interest was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) profits. The excellence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) house
was firmly established. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kept it up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kept the modest prices
up. Often she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had to refuse guests. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) naturally did so with a certain
distant condescension. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) manner to guests increased in stiff
formality; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was excessively firm with undesirables. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grew to
be seriously convinced that no pension as good as hers existed in the
world, or ever had existed, or ever could exist. Hers was the acme of
niceness and respectability. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) preference for the respectable rose to
a passion. And there were no faults in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) establishment. Even the once
despised showy furniture of Madame Foucault had mysteriously changed
into the best conceivable furniture; and its cracks were hallowed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) never heard a word of Gerald nor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) family. In the thousands of
people who stayed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) perfect roof, not one mentioned Bursley nor
disclosed a knowledge of anybody that Sophia had known. Several men had
the wit to propose marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with more or less skilfulness, but
none of them was skilful enough to perturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had forgotten
the face of love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a landlady. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was THE landlady: efficient,
stylish, diplomatic, and tremendously experienced. There was no
trickery, no baseness of Parisian life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not acquainted with
and armed against. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not be startled and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not be
swindled.

<p/>Years passed, until there was a vista of years behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Sometimes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would think, in an unoccupied moment, <div class="bookquote">``How strange it is that I
should be here, doing what I am doing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But the regular ordinariness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) existence would instantly seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again. At the end of 1878, the
Exhibition Year, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) Pension consisted of two floors instead of one,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had turned the two hundred pounds stolen from Gerald into over
two thousand.

<p/>WHAT LIFE IS




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>FRENSHAM``S

<p/>I


<p/>Matthew Peel-Swynnerton sat in the long dining-room of the Pension
Frensham, Rue Lord Byron, Paris; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) looked out of place there. It
was an apartment about thirty feet in length, and of the width of two
windows, which sufficiently lighted one half of a very long table with
round ends. The gloom of the other extremity was illumined by a large
mirror in a tarnished gilt frame, which filled a good portion of the
wall opposite the windows. Near the mirror was a high folding-screen of
four leaves, and behind this screen could be heard the sound of a door
continually shutting and opening. In the long wall to the left of the
windows were two doors, one dark and important, a door of state,
through which a procession of hungry and a procession of sated solemn
self-conscious persons passed twice daily, and the other, a smaller
door, glazed, its glass painted with wreaths of roses, not an original
door of the house, but a late breach in the wall, that seemed to lead
to the dangerous and to the naughty. The wall-paper and the window
drapery were rich and forbidding, dark in hue, mysterious of pattern.
Over the state-door was a pair of antlers. And at intervals, so high up
as to defy inspection, engravings and oil-paintings made oblong patches
on the walls. They were hung from immense nails with porcelain heads,
and they appeared to depict the more majestic aspect of man and nature.
One engraving, over the mantelpiece and nearer earth than the rest,
unmistakably showed Louis Philippe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philippe</b></font>) family in attitudes of
virtue. Beneath this royal group, a vast gilt clock, flanked by
pendants of the same period, gave the right time--a quarter past seven.

<p/>And down the room, filling it, ran the great white table, bordered with
bowed heads and the backs of chairs. There were over thirty people at
the table, and the peculiarly restrained noisiness of their knives and
forks on the plates proved that they were a discreet and a correct
people. Their clothes--blouses, bodices, and jackets--did not flatter
the lust of the eye. Only two or three were in evening dress. They
spoke little, and generally in a timorous tone, as though silence had
been enjoined. Somebody would half-whisper a remark, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)
neighbour, absently fingering her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) bread and lifting gaze from her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) plate
into vacancy, would conscientiously weigh the remark and half-whisper
in reply: <div class="bookquote">``I dare say.''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div>But a few spoke loudly and volubly, and were
regarded by the rest, who envied them, as underbred.

<p/>Food was quite properly the chief preoccupation. The diners ate as
those eat who are paying a fixed price per day for as much as they can
consume while observing the rules of the game. Without moving their
heads they glanced out of the corners of their eyes, watching the
manoeuvres of the three starched maids who served. They had no
conception of food save as portions laid out in rows on large silver
dishes, and when a maid bent over them deferentially, balancing the
dish, they summed up the offering in an instant, and in an instant
decided how much they could decently take, and to what extent they
could practise the theoretic liberty of choice. And if the food for any
reason did not tempt them, or if it egregiously failed to coincide with
their aspirations, they considered themselves aggrieved. For, according
to the game, they might not command; they had the right to seize all
that was presented under their noses, like genteel tigers; and they had
the right to refuse: that was all. The dinner was thus a series of
emotional crises for the diners, who knew only that full dishes and
clean plates came endlessly from the banging door behind the screen,
and that ravaged dishes and dirty plates vanished endlessly through the
same door. They were all eating similar food simultaneously; they began
together and they finished together. The flies that haunted the
paper-bunches which hung from the chandeliers to the level of the
flower-vases, were more free. The sole event that chequered the exact
regularity of the repast was the occasional arrival of a wine-bottle
for one of the guests. The receiver of the wine-bottle signed a small
paper in exchange for it and wrote largely a number on the label of the
bottle; then, staring at the number and fearing that after all it might
be misread by a stupid maid or an unscrupulous compeer, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would
re-write the number on another part of the label, even more largely.

<p/>Matthew Peel-Swynnerton obviously did not belong to this world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was
a young man of twenty-five or so, not handsome, but elegant. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
was not in evening dress, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was, as a fact, in a very light
grey suit, entirely improper to a dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was elegant. The suit was
admirably cut, and nearly new; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) wore it as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had never
worn anything else. Also his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) demeanour, reserved yet free from
self-consciousness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) method of handling a knife and fork, the
niceties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) manner in transferring food from the silver dishes to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) plate, the tone in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) ordered half a bottle of wine--all
these details infallibly indicated to the company that Matthew
Peel-Swynnerton was their superior. Some folks hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was the
son of a lord, or even a lord. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) happened to be fixed at the end of
the table, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) back to the window, and there was a vacant chair on
either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>); this situation favoured the hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) high rank.
In truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was the son, the grandson, and several times the nephew,
of earthenware manufacturers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) noticed that the large `compote' -LRB-as
it was called in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) trade-RRB- which marked the centre of the table, was
the production of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) firm. This surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>), for Peel, Swynnerton
and Co., known and revered throughout the Five Towns as <div class="bookquote">``Peels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peel Swynnerton Co.</b></font>)</div>did
not cater for cheap markets. A late guest startled the room, a fat,
flabby, middle-aged man whose nose would have roused the provisional
hostility of those who have convinced themselves that Jews are not as
other men. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose did not definitely brand him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a usurer and a
murderer of Christ, but it was suspicious. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) clothes hung loose, and
might have been anybody's clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) advanced with brisk assurance to
the table, bowed, somewhat too effusively, to several people, and sat
down next to Peel-Swynnerton. One of the maids at once brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) a
plate of soup, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Marie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was
evidently a habitue of the house. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) spectacled eyes beamed the
superiority which comes of knowing girls by their names. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was
seriously handicapped in the race for sustenance, being two and a half
courses behind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) drew level with speed and then, having
accomplished this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sighed, and pointedly engaged Peel-Swynnerton
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) sociable glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) breathed out. <div class="bookquote">``Nuisance when you come in late, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/>Peel-Swynnerton gave a reluctant affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't only upset you! It upsets the house! Servants don't like it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured Peel-Swynnerton, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``However, it's not often _I_'m late,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Can't help it
sometimes. Business! Worst of these French business people is that
they've no notion of time. Appointments...! God bless my soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you come here often?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Peel-Swynnerton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) detested the
fellow, quite inexcusably, perhaps because his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) serviette was tucked
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) chin; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) saw that the fellow was one of your determined
talkers, who always win in the end. Moreover, as being clearly not an
ordinary tourist in Paris, the fellow mildly excited his (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I live here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. <div class="bookquote">``Very convenient for a bachelor, you
know. Have done for years. My office is just close by. You may know my
name--Lewis Mardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/>Peel-Swynnerton hesitated. The hesitation convicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) of not `knowing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) Paris' well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``House-agent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lewis Mardon</b></font>)</div>said Lewis Mardon, quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Peel-Swynnerton, vaguely recalling a vision of the name
among the advertisements on newspaper kiosks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>Mr. Mardon went on, <div class="bookquote">``my name is as well-known as anybody's
in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>assented Peel-Swynnerton.

<p/>The conversation fell for a few moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Staying here long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>Mr. Mardon demanded, having added up
Peel-Swynnerton as a man of style and of means, and being puzzled by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) presence at that table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Peel-Swynnerton.

<p/>This was a lie, justified in the utterer's opinion as a repulse to Mr.
Mardon's vulgar inquisitiveness, such inquisitiveness as might have
been expected from a fellow who tucked his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) serviette under his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chin.
Peel-Swynnerton knew exactly how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) would stay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) would stay
until the day after the morrow; he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had only about fifty francs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had been making a fool of himself in another quarter of
Paris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had descended to the Pension Frensham as a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
could be absolutely sure of spending not more than twelve francs a day.
Its reputation was high, and it was convenient for the Galliera Museum,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was making some drawings which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had come to Paris expressly
to make, and without which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) could not reputably return to England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
was capable of foolishness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was also capable of wisdom, and
scarcely any pressure of need would have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) to write home for
money to replace the money spent on making himself into a fool.

<p/>Mr. Mardon was conscious of a check. But, being of an accommodating
disposition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) at once tried another direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good food here, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Peel-Swynnerton, with sincerity. <div class="bookquote">``I was quite--''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment, a tall straight woman of uncertain age pushed open the
principal door and stood for an instant in the doorway. Peel-Swynnerton
had just time to notice that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was handsome and pale, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hair was black, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone again, followed by a clipped
poodle that accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had signed with a brief gesture to one
of the servants, who at once set about lighting the gas-jets over the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked Peel-Swynnerton, without reflecting that it was
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) who was making advances to the fellow whose napkin covered all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) shirt-front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the missis, that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Mardon, in a lower and
semi-confidential voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mrs. Frensham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Frensham</b></font>) real name is Scales,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Mardon, proudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Widow, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) runs the whole show?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) runs the entire contraption,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Mardon, solemnly; <div class="bookquote">``and
don't you make any mistake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) was getting familiar.

<p/>Peel-Swynnerton beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) off once more, glancing with careful,
uninterested nonchalance at the gas-burners which exploded one after
another with a little plop under the application of the maid's taper.
The white table gleamed more whitely than ever under the flaring gas.
People at the end of the room away from the window instinctively
smiled, as though the sun had begun to shine. The aspect of the dinner
was changed, ameliorated; and with the reiterated statement that the
evenings were drawing in though it was only July, conversation became
almost general. In two minutes Mr. Mardon was genially talking across
the whole length of the table. The meal finished in a state that
resembled conviviality.

<p/>Matthew Peel-Swynnerton might not go out into the crepuscular delights
of Paris. Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) remained within the shelter of the Pension, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
could not hope to complete successfully his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) re-conversion from folly to
wisdom. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) bravely passed through the small rose-embroidered door
into a small glass-covered courtyard, furnished with palms, wicker
armchairs, and two small tables; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) lighted a pipe and pulled out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) pocket a copy of The Referee. That retreat was called the
Lounge; it was the only part of the Pension where smoking was not
either a positive crime or a transgression against good form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) felt
lonely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) said to himself grimly in one breath that pleasure was all
rot, and in the next he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) sullenly demanded of the universe how it was
that pleasure could not go on for ever, and why he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was not Mr. Barney
Barnato. Two old men entered the retreat and burnt cigarettes with many
precautions. Then Mr. Lewis Mardon appeared and sat down boldly next to
Matthew, like a privileged friend. After all, Mr. Mardon was better
than nobody whatever, and Matthew decided to suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>), especially as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) began without preliminary skirmishing to talk about life in Paris.
An irresistible subject! Mr. Mardon said in a worldly tone that the
existence of a bachelor in Paris might easily be made agreeable. But
that, of course, for himself--well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) preferred, as a general rule,
the Pension Frensham sort of thing; and it was excellent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>)
business. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) could not ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) knew ... He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) compared the advantages
of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) called `knocking about' in Paris, with the equivalent in
London. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) information about London was out of date, and
Peel-Swynnerton was able to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) right on important details. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
information about Paris was infinitely precious and interesting to the
younger man, who saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had hitherto lived under strange
misconceptions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have a whiskey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Mardon, suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Very good here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>)
added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>drawled Peel-Swynnerton.

<p/>The temptation to listen to Mr. Mardon as long as Mr. Mardon would talk
was not to be overcome. And presently, when the old men had departed,
they were frankly telling each other stories in the dimness of the
retreat. Then, when the supply of stories came to an end, Mr. Mardon
smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) lips over the last drop of whiskey and ejaculated: <div class="bookquote">``Yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>as if giving a general confirmation to all that had been said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do have one with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, politely. It was the least he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)
could do.

<p/>The second supply of whiskies was brought into the Lounge by Mr.
Mardon's Marie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) smiled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) familiarly, and remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>)
supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would soon be going to bed after a hard day's work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
gave a moue and a flounce in reply, and swished out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carries herself well, doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Mardon, as though
Marie had been an exhibit at an agricultural show. <div class="bookquote">``Ten years ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>)
was very fresh and pretty, but of course it takes it out of 'em, a
place like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Peel-Swynnerton, <div class="bookquote">``they must like it or they wouldn't
stay--that is, unless things are very different here from what they are
in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation seemed to have stimulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) to examine the woman
question in all its bearings, with philosophic curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! They LIKE it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>Mr. Mardon assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>), as one who knew. <div class="bookquote">``Besides,
Mrs. Scales treats 'em very well. I know THAT. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)'s told me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)'s
very particular'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) looked around to see if walls had ears--<div class="bookquote">``and, by
Jove, you've got to be; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) treats 'em well. You'd scarcely believe
the wages they get, and pickings. Now at the Hotel Moscow--know the
Hotel Moscow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Happily Peel-Swynnerton did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) had been advised to avoid it because it
catered exclusively for English visitors, but in the Pension Frensham
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) had accepted something even more exclusively British than the Hotel
Moscow. Mr. Mardon was quite relieved at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Hotel Moscow is a limited company now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I floated it. It was my idea. A great success! That's how I know
all about the Hotel Moscow.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) looked at the walls again. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to
do the same here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) murmured, and Peel-Swynnerton had to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
appreciated this confidence. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) never would agree. I've tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
all ways. No go! It's a thousand pities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paying thing, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This place? I should say it was! And I ought to be able to judge, I
reckon. Mrs. Scales is one of the shrewdest women you'd meet in a day's
march. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)'s made a lot of money here, a lot of money. And there's no
reason why a place like this shouldn't be five times as big as it is.
Ten times. The scope's unlimited, my dear sir. All that's wanted is
capital. Naturally she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) has capital of her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could get more.
But then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) says, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) doesn't want the place any bigger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) says
it's now just as big as she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) can handle. That isn't so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)'s a woman
who could handle anything--a born manager--but even if it was so, all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) would have to do would be to retire--only leave us the place and
the name. It's the name that counts. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)'s made the name of
Frensham worth something, I can tell you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) get the place from her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Peel-Swynnerton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>)
own name of Scales intrigued him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Mardon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Bought it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) own, after the husband's
time, for a song--a song! I know, because I knew the original
Frenshams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have been in Paris a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Peel-Swynnerton.

<p/>Mr. Mardon could never resist an opportunity to talk about himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>)
was a wonderful history. And Peel-Swynnerton, while scorning the man
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) fatuity, was impressed. And when that was finished--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Mardon after a pause, reaffirming everything in
general by a single monosyllable.

<p/>Shortly afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) rose, saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) habits were regular.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) said with a mechanical smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``G-good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Peel-Swynnerton, trying to force the tone of
fellowship and not succeeding. Their intimacy, which had sprung up like
a mushroom, suddenly fell into dust. Peel-Swynnerton's unspoken comment
to Mr. Mardon's back was: <div class="bookquote">``Ass!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mardon/Mardon</b></font>)</div>Still, the sum of Peel-Swynnerton's
knowledge had indubitably been increased during the evening. And the
hour was yet early. Half-past ten! The Folies-Marigny, with its
beautiful architecture and its crowds of white toilettes, and its
frothing of champagne and of beer, and its musicians in tight red
coats, was just beginning to be alive--and at a distance of scarcely a
stone's-throw! Peel-Swynnerton pictured the terraced, glittering hall,
which had been the prime origin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) exceeding foolishness. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
pictured all the other resorts, great and small, garlanded with white
lanterns, in the Champs Elysees; and the sombre aisles of the Champs
Elysees where mysterious pale figures walked troublingly under the
shade of trees, while snatches of wild song or absurd brassy music
floated up from the resorts and restaurants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) wanted to go out and
spend those fifty francs that remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) pocket. After all, why
not telegraph to England for more money? <div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) said
savagely, and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) arms and got up. The Lounge was very small,
gloomy and dreary.

<p/>One brilliant incandescent light burned in the hall, crudely
illuminating the wicker fauteuils, a corded trunk with a blue-and-red
label on it, a Fitzroy barometer, a map of Paris, a coloured poster of
the Compagnie Transatlantique, and the mahogany retreat of the
hall-portress. In that retreat was not only the hall-portress--an aged
woman with a white cap above her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrinkled pink face--but the mistress
of the establishment. They were murmuring together softly; they seemed
to be well disposed to one another. The portress was respectful, but
the mistress was respectful also. The hall, with its one light
tranquilly burning, was bathed in an honest calm, the calm of a day's
work accomplished, of gradual relaxation from tension, of growing
expectation of repose. In its simplicity it affected Peel-Swynnerton as
a medicine tonic for nerves might have affected him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). In that hall,
though exterior nocturnal life was but just stirring into activity, it
seemed that the middle of the night had come, and that these two women
alone watched in a mansion full of sleepers. And all the recitals which
Peel-Swynnerton and Mr. Mardon had exchanged sank to the level of
pitiably foolish gossip. Peel-Swynnerton felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) duty to the
house was to retire to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) felt, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) could not leave the
house without saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was going out, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) lacked the
courage deliberately to tell these two women that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was going out--at
that time of night! He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) dropped into one of the chairs and made a second
attempt to peruse The Referee. Useless! Either his (<font color='blue'><b>Referee</b></font>) mind was outside in
the Champs Elysees, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Referee</b></font>) gaze would wander surreptitiously to the
figure of Mrs. Scales. He (<font color='blue'><b>Referee</b></font>) could not well distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) face because
it was in the shadow of the mahogany.

<p/>Then the portress came forth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) box, and, slightly bent, sped
actively across the hall, smiling pleasantly at the guest as she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) passed
him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), and disappeared up the stairs. The mistress was alone in the
retreat. Peel-Swynnerton jumped up brusquely, dropping the paper with a
rustle, and approached her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) said deferentially. <div class="bookquote">``Have any letters come for me
to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) knew that the arrival of letters for him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) was impossible, since
nobody knew his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) address.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What name?''  (<font color='red'><b>the questioner</b></font>)</div>The question was coldly polite, and the questioner looked
him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) full in the face. Undoubtedly she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was a handsome woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hair
was greying at the temples, and the skin was withered and crossed with
lines. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was handsome. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was one of those women of whom to
their last on earth the stranger will say: <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was young she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) must
have been worth looking at!'' (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>--with a little transient regret that
beautiful young women cannot remain for ever young. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) voice was firm
and even, sweet in tone, and yet morally harsh from incessant
traffic--with all varieties of human nature. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) eyes were the
impartial eyes of one who is always judging. And evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was a
proud, even a haughty creature, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) careful, controlled
politeness. Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) considered herself superior to no matter what
guest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) eyes announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had lived and learnt, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) knew
more about life than any one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was likely to meet, and that
having pre-eminently succeeded in life, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had tremendous confidence
in herself. The proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) success was the unique Frensham's. A
consciousness of the uniqueness of Frensham's was also in those eyes.
Theoretically Matthew Peel-Swynnerton's mental attitude towards
lodging-house keepers was condescending, but here it was not
condescending. It had the real respectfulness of a man who for the
moment at any rate is impressed beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calculations. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glance
fell as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peel-Swynnerton.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said the words awkwardly, and rather fearfully, as if aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was playing with fire. If this Mrs. Scales was the long-vanished aunt
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, Cyril Povey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) must know those two names, locally so
famous. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) start? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) show a sign of being perturbed? At first
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) detected a symptom of emotion, but in an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had detected nothing of the sort, and that it was silly to
suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was treading on the edge of a romance. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) turned
towards the letter-rack at her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) side, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) face in profile. It
bore a sudden and astonishing likeness to the profile of Cyril Povey; a
resemblance unmistakable and finally decisive. The nose, and the curve
of the upper lip were absolutely Cyril's. Matthew Peel-Swynnerton felt
very queer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) felt like a criminal in peril of being caught in the
act, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) could not understand why he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) should feel so. The landlady
looked in the ``P' pigeon-hole, and in the ``S' pigeon-hole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``I see nothing for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Taken with a swift rash audacity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Have you had any one named
Povey here recently?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Povey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Cyril Povey, of Bursley--in the Five Towns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was very impressionable, very sensitive, was Matthew
Peel-Swynnerton. His (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) voice trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) spoke. But hers also trembled
in reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I remember! No! Were you expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) to be here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it wasn't at all sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said, apparently with the simple perfunctoriness of
the landlady who says good-night to dozens of strangers every evening.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) hurried away upstairs, and met the portress coming down. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the queer things--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) kept nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
head. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had encountered something REALLY strange in the
spectacle of existence. It had fallen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) to discover the legendary
woman who had fled from Bursley before he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was born, and of whom nobody
knew anything. What news for Cyril! What a staggering episode! He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had
scarcely any sleep that night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would be able to
meet Mrs. Scales without self-consciousness on the morrow. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
was spared the curious ordeal of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) did not appear at all
on the following day; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) see her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could not
find a pretext for asking why she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was invisible.

<p/>II

<p/>The hansom of Matthew Peel-Swynnerton drew up in front of No. 26,
Victoria Grove, Chelsea; his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) kit-bag was on the roof of the cab. The
cabman had a red flower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) buttonhole. Matthew leaped out of the
vehicle, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) straw hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) head with one hand. On reaching
the pavement he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) checked himself suddenly and became carelessly calm.
Another straw-hatted and grey-clad figure was standing at the side-gate
of No. 26 in the act of lighting a cigarette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Matt!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the second figure, languidly, and in a veiled
voice due to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was still holding the match to the
cigarette and puffing. <div class="bookquote">``What's the meaning of all this fluster? You're
just the man I want to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) threw away the match with a wave of the arm, and took Matthew's hand
for a moment, blowing a double shaft of smoke through his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to see you, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``And I've only got a minute.
I'm on my way to Euston. I must catch the twelve-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) friend, and could positively see no feature of it that
was not a feature of Mrs. Scales's face. Also, the elderly woman held
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body in exactly the same way as the young man. It was entirely
disconcerting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have a cigarette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril Povey</b></font>)</div>answered Cyril Povey, imperturbably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was two
years younger than Matthew, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had acquired most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) vast
and intricate knowledge of life and art, with certain leading notions
of deportment; whose pupil indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) was in all the things that matter
to young men. But he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) had already surpassed his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) professor. He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) could
pretend to be old much more successfully than Matthew could.

<p/>The cabman approvingly watched the ignition of the second cigarette,
and then the cabman pulled out a cigar, and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) large, white
teeth, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) bit the end off it. The appearance and manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) fare,
the quality of the kit-bag, and the opening gestures of the interview
between the two young dukes, had put the cabman in an optimistic mood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had no apprehensions of miserly and ungentlemanly conduct by his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)
fare upon the arrival at Euston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) knew the language of the tilt of a
straw hat. And it was a magnificent day in London. The group of the two
elegances dominated by the perfection of the cabman made a striking
tableau of triumphant masculinity, content with itself, and needing
nothing.

<p/>Matthew lightly took Cyril's arm and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) further down the street,
past the gate leading to the studio -LRB-hidden behind a house-RRB- which Cyril
rented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``I've found your aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's very nice of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril, solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``That's a
friendly act. May I ask what aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Scales,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``You know--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the--''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril's face changed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, precisely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was not being cheated
of the legitimate joy caused by making a sensation. Assuredly he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had
made a sensation in Victoria Grove.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had related the whole story, Cyril said: <div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) doesn't know
you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so. No, I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) doesn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) may guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can you be certain you haven't made a mistake? It may be
that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>Matthew interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've not made any

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proof be damned!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, nettled. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you it's HER!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! All right! All right! What puzzles me most is what the devil you
were doing in a place like that. According to your description of it,
it must be a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I went there because I was broke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Razzle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/>Matthew nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty stiff, that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>commented Cyril, when Matthew had narrated the
prologue to Frensham's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) absolutely swore she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never took less than two hundred
francs. And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) looked it, too! And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was worth it! I had the time of
my life with that woman. I can tell you one thing--no more English for
me! They simply aren't in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/>Matthew reflected judicially. <div class="bookquote">``I should say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was thirty.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The gaze
of admiration and envy was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had the legitimate joy of
making a second sensation. <div class="bookquote">``I'll let you know more about that when I
come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``I can open your eyes, my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril smiled sheepishly. <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you stay now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going
to take the cast of that Verrall girl's arm this afternoon, and I know
I can't do it alone. And Robson's no good. You're just the man I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, come into the studio a minute, anyhow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't time; I shall miss my train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care if you miss forty trains. You must come in. You've got to
see that fountain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril insisted crossly.

<p/>Matthew yielded. When they emerged into the street again, after six
minutes of Cyril's savage interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) own work, Matthew remembered
Mrs. Scales.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you'll write to your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril, <div class="bookquote">``I'll write; but if you happen to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), you might
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``Shall you go over to Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! To see Auntie?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Depends. If the mater
will fork out all my exes ... it's an idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said lightly, and then
without any change of tone, <div class="bookquote">``Naturally, if you're going to idle about
here all morning you aren't likely to catch the twelve-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Matthew got into the cab, while the driver, the stump of a cigar
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) exposed teeth, leaned forward and lifted the reins away
from the tilted straw hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By-the-by, lend me some silver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>Matthew demanded. <div class="bookquote">``It's a good thing
I've got my return ticket. I've run it as fine as ever I did in my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril produced eight shillings in silver. Secure in the possession of
these riches, Matthew called to the driver--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Euston--like hell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said the driver, calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not coming my way I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>Matthew shouted as an afterthought, just
when the cab began to move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Barber's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril shouted in answer, and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hand.

<p/>The horse rattled into Fulham Road.

<p/>III

<p/>Three days later Matthew Peel-Swynnerton was walking along Bursley
Market Place when, just opposite the Town Hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) met a short, fat,
middle-aged lady dressed in black, with a black embroidered mantle, and
a small bonnet tied with black ribbon and ornamented with jet fruit and
crape leaves. As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stepped slowly and carefully forward she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had the
dignified, important look of a provincial woman who has always been
accustomed to deference in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) native town, and whose income is ample
enough to extort obsequiousness from the vulgar of all ranks. But
immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) caught sight of Matthew, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) became
simple and naive. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blushed slightly, smiling with a timid pleasure.
For her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), Matthew belonged to a superior race. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) bore the almost sacred
name of Peel. His (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) family had been distinguished in the district for
generations. <div class="bookquote">``Peel!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You could without impropriety utter it in the same
breath with <div class="bookquote">``Wedgwood.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And ``Swynnerton' stood not much lower. Neither
her (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) self-respect, which was great, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) commonsense, which far
exceeded the average, could enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) to extend as far as the Peels
the theory that one man is as good as another. The Peels never shopped
in St. Luke's Square. Even in its golden days the Square could not have
expected such a condescension. The Peels shopped in London or in
Stafford; at a pinch, in Oldcastle. That was the distinction for the
ageing stout lady in black. Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not in six years recovered
from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) surprise that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son and Matthew Peel-Swynnerton treated each
other rudely as equals! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and Matthew did not often meet, but they
liked each other. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) involuntary meekness flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). And his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)
rather elaborate homage flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fundamental
goodness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) occasional raps at Cyril seemed to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) into
ecstasies of joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), standing over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) hat
raised. -LRB-It was a fashion he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had picked up in Paris.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Here I am, you
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're quite a stranger, Mr. Matthew. I needn't ask you how you are.
Have you been seeing anything of my boy lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not since Wednesday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s written to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no `of course' about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed faintly. <div class="bookquote">``I had a short
letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on Wednesday morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said you were in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But since that--hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on Sunday I shall be lucky, bless ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said
Constance, grimly. <div class="bookquote">``It's not letter-writing that will kill Cyril.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you mean to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hasn't--''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>Matthew stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever's amiss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Constance. Matthew was at a loss to know what
to do or say. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Matthew, do please--''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance's tone had suddenly quite
changed. It had become firm, commanding, and gravely suspicious. The
conversation had ceased to be small-talk for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Matthew saw how nervous and how fragile she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had never noticed
before that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so sensitive to trifles, though it was notorious
that nobody could safely discuss Cyril with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in terms of chaff. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
was really astounded at that youth's carelessness, shameful
carelessness. That Cyril's attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother was marked by a
certain benevolent negligence--this Matthew knew; but not to have
written to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with the important news concerning Mrs. Scales was
utterly inexcusable; and Matthew determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would tell Cyril
so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt very sorry for Mrs. Povey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) seemed pathetic to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>),
standing there in ignorance of a tremendous fact which she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) ought to
have been aware of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was very content that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had said nothing about
Mrs. Scales to anybody except his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own mother, who had prudently
enjoined silence upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) one duty, having told Cyril,
was to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mouth shut until the Poveys talked. Had it not been for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother's advice he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would assuredly have spread the amazing tale,
and Mrs. Povey might have first heard of it from a stranger's gossip,
which would have been too cruel upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>Matthew tried to smile gaily, archly. <div class="bookquote">``You're bound to hear from
Cyril to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wanted to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was concealing merely some delightful
surprise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) did not succeed. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) experience of
the world and of women he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was not clever enough to deceive that simple
woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm waiting, Mr. Matthew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, in a tone that flattened the
smile out of Matthew's sympathetic face. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was ruthless. The fact
was, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had in an instant convinced herself that Cyril had met some
girl and was engaged to be married. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could think of nothing else.
<div class="bookquote">``What has Cyril been doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing to do with Cyril,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was about--Mrs. Scales,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) murmured, nearly trembling. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
offered no response, merely looking around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a peculiar fashion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Shall we walk along a bit?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) turned in the direction in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been going. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) obeyed the suggestion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did ye say?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked. The name of Scales for a moment had no
significance for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comprehended it she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was afraid, and
so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said vacantly, as though wishing to postpone a shock: <div class="bookquote">``What did
ye say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said it was about Mrs. Scales. You know I m-met her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) in Paris.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was saying to himself: <div class="bookquote">``I ought not to be telling this poor old
thing here in the street. But what can I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) muttered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) with a worried expression. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
observed that the hand that carried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reticule was making strange
purposeless curves in the air, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rosy face went the colour of
cream, as though it had been painted with one stroke of an unseen
brush. Matthew was very much put about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I must sit me--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bag dropped.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) supported her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the door of Allman's shop, the ironmonger's.
Unfortunately, there were two steps up into the shop, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not
climb them. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) collapsed like a sack of flour on the first step. Young
Edward Allman ran to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allman</b></font>) was wearing a black apron and
fidgeting with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allman</b></font>) excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) up--don't try to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) up, Mr. Peel-Swynnerton!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Allman</b></font>)
cried, as Matthew instinctively began to do the wrong thing.

<p/>Matthew stopped, looking a fool and feeling one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) and young
Allman contemplated each other helpless for a second across the body of
Constance Povey. A part of the Market Place now perceived that the
unusual was occurring. It was Mr. Shawcross, the chemist next door to
Allman's who dealt adequately with the situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allman</b></font>) had seen all,
while selling a Kodak to a young lady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allman</b></font>) ran out with salts.
Constance recovered very rapidly. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not quite swooned. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave a
long sigh, and whispered weakly that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was all right. The three men
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into the lofty dark shop, which smelt of nails and of
stove-polish, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was balanced on a ricketty chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Allman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed young Allman, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allman</b></font>) loud voice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could
smile and the pink was returning reluctantly to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``You
mustn't frighten us like that, Mrs. Povey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div><p/>Matthew said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had at last created a genuine sensation. Once
again he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt like a criminal, and could not understand why.

<p/>Constance announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would walk slowly home, down the Cock-yard
and along Wedgwood Street. But when, glancing round in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) returned
strength, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw the hedge of faces at the doorway, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) agreed with
Mr. Shawcross that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would do better to have a cab. Young Allman went
to the door and whistled to the unique cab that stands for ever at the
grand entrance to the Town Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Matthew will come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, with pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed through the little crowd of gapers on Mr. Shawcross's
arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just take care of yourself, missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shawcross</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shawcross to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
through the window of the cab. <div class="bookquote">``It's fainting weather, and we're none
of us any younger, seemingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully sorry I upset you, Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, when the cab
moved.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, refusing his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) apology as unnecessary. Tears filled
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes. In less than a minute the cab had stopped in front of
Constance's light-grained door. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reticule from Matthew,
who had carried it since it fell. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would pay the cabman. Never
before had Matthew permitted a woman to pay for a cab in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had
ridden; but there was no arguing with Constance. Constance was
dangerous.

<p/>Amy Bates, still inhabiting the cave, had seen the cab-wheels through
the grating of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) window and had panted up the kitchen stairs to open
the door ere Constance had climbed the steps. Amy, decidedly over
forty, was a woman of authority. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wanted to know what was the
matter, and Constance had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had `felt unwell.'' Amy
took the hat and mantle and departed to prepare a cup of tea. When they
were alone Constance said to Matthew:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now. Mr. Matthew, will you please tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) began.

<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) told it, in quite a few words, it indeed had the air of being
`only that.'' And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) voice shook, in sympathy with the ageing
woman's controlled but visible emotion. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) that gladness
should have filled the absurd little parlour, but the spirit that
presided had no name; it was certainly not joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) himself felt very
sad, desolated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would have given much money to have been spared the
experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) knew simply that in the memory of the stout, comical,
nice woman in the rocking-chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had stirred old, old things, wakened
slumbers that might have been eternal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
sitting on the very spot where the sofa had been on which Samuel Povey
lay when a beautiful and shameless young creature of fifteen extracted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) tooth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did not know that Constance was sitting in the very chair
in which the memorable Mrs. Baines had sat in vain conflict with that
same unconquerable girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) did not know ten thousand matters that were
rushing violently about in the vast heart of Constance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) cross-questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in detail. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did not put the questions
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) innocence expected; such as, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sister looked old,
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) hair was grey, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was stout or thin. And until Amy,
mystified and resentful, had served the tea, on a little silver tray,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) remained comparatively calm. It was in the middle of a gulp of tea
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) broke down, and Matthew had to take the cup from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't thank you, Mr. Matthew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wept. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't thank you
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I've done nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) protested.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I never hoped for this. Never hoped for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
went on. <div class="bookquote">``It makes me so happy--in a way... You mustn't take any
notice of me. I'm silly. You must kindly write down that address for
me. And I must write to Cyril at once. And I must see Mr. Critchlow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's really very funny that Cyril hasn't written to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>said Matthew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cyril has not been a good son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said with sudden, solemn coldness.
<div class="bookquote">``To think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) should have kept that...!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wept again.

<p/>At length Matthew saw the possibility of leaving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) warm,
soft, crinkled hand round his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've behaved very nicely over this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And very cleverly.
In EVERY thing--both over there and here. Nobody could have shown a
nicer feeling than you've shown. It's a great comfort to me that my son
has got you for a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) escapades, and of all the knowledge, unutterable
in Bursley, fantastically impossible in Bursley, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had imparted
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) marvelled that the maternal instinct should be so
deceived. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was deserved.

<p/>Outside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) gave vent to a ``Phew' of relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) smiled, in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
worldliest manner. But the smile was a sham. A pretence to himself! A
childish attempt to disguise from himself how profoundly he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been
moved by a natural scene!

<p/>IV

<p/>On the night when Matthew Peel-Swynnerton spoke to Mrs. Scales, Matthew
was not the only person in the Pension Frensham who failed to sleep.
When the old portress came downstairs from her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) errand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) observed
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) mistress was leaving the mahogany retreat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) is sleeping tranquilly, the poor one!''  (<font color='red'><b>the portress</b></font>)</div>said the portress,
discharging her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) commission, which had been to learn the latest news of
the mistress's indisposed dog, Fossette. In saying this her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ancient,
vibrant voice was rich with sympathy for the suffering animal. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was rather like a figure out of an almshouse, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
pink, apparently brittle skin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tight black dress, and frilled white
cap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stooped habitually, and always walked quickly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head a
few inches in advance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) grey hair was scanty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
old; nobody perhaps knew exactly how old. Sophia had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with the
Pension, over a quarter of a century before, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was old and
could not easily have found another place. Although the clientele was
almost exclusively English, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spoke only French, explaining herself
to Britons by means of benevolent smiles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall go to bed, Jacqueline,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>said the mistress, in reply.

<p/>A strange reply, thought Jacqueline. The unalterable custom of
Jacqueline was to retire at midnight and to rise at five-thirty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)
mistress also usually retired about midnight, and during the final hour
mistress and portress saw a good deal of each other. And considering
that Jacqueline had just been sent up into the mistress's own bedroom
to glance at Fossette, and that the bulletin was satisfactory, and that
madame and Jacqueline had several customary daily matters to discuss,
it seemed odd that madame should thus be going instantly to bed.
However, Jacqueline said nothing but:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, madame. And the number 32?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arrange yourself as you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>said the mistress, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well, madame. Good evening, madame, and a good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacqueline, alone in the hall, re-entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) box and set upon one of
those endless, mysterious tasks which occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) was not
rushing to and fro or whistling up the tubes.

<p/>Sophia, scarcely troubling even to glance into Fossette's round basket,
undressed, put out the light, and got into bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt extremely and
inexplicably gloomy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not wish to reflect; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) strongly wished
not to reflect; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind insisted on reflection--a monotonous,
futile, and distressing reflection. Povey! Povey! Could this be
Constance's Povey, the unique Samuel Povey? That is to say, not he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>), but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) son, Constance's son. Had Constance a grown-up son? Constance must
be over fifty now, perhaps a grandmother! Had she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) really married Samuel
Povey? Possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was dead. Certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) mother must be dead, and
Aunt Harriet and Mr. Critchlow. If alive, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother must be at least
eighty years of age.

<p/>The cumulative effect of merely remaining inactive when one ought to be
active, was terrible. Undoubtedly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should have communicated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
family. It was silly not to have done so. After all, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had,
as a child, stolen a trifle of money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wealthy aunt, what would
that have mattered? She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been proud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was criminally proud. That
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) vice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) admitted it frankly. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
pride. Everybody had some weak spot. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reputation for sagacity, for
commonsense, was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knew, enormous; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) always felt, when people were
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that they regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as a very unusually wise woman.
And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been guilty of the capital folly of cutting herself off
from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was ageing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was alone in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was enriching herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the most perfectly managed and the most
respectable Pension in the world -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sincerely believed-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
alone in the world. Acquaintances she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had--French people who never
offered nor accepted hospitality other than tea or wine, and one or two
members of the English commercial colony--but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) one friend was
Fossette, aged three years! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the most solitary person on earth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard no word of Gerald, no word of anybody. Nobody whatever
could truly be interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fate. This was what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had achieved
after a quarter of a century of ceaseless labour and anxiety, during
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not once been away from the Rue Lord Byron for more than
thirty hours at a stretch. It was appalling--the passage of years; and
the passage of years would grow more appalling. Ten years hence, where
would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pictured herself dying. Horrible!

<p/>Of course there was nothing to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from going back to Bursley
and repairing the grand error of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) girlhood. No, nothing except the
fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole soul recoiled from the mere idea of any such
enterprise! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a fixture in the Rue Lord Byron. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a part of
the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew all that happened or could happen there. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
attached to it by the heavy chains of habit. In the chill way of long
use she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved it. There! The incandescent gas-burner of the street-lamp
outside had been turned down, as it was turned down every night! If it
is possible to love such a phenomenon, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved that phenomenon. That
phenomenon was a portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life, dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>An agreeable young man, that Peel-Swynnerton! Then evidently, since her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
days in Bursley, the Peels and the Swynnertons, partners in business,
must have intermarried, or there must have been some affair of a will.
Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suspect who she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had a very self-conscious, guilty
look. No! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have suspected who she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was. The idea was
ridiculous. Probably he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not even know that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name was Scales. And
even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had probably never heard of Gerald Scales,
or the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flight. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not have been born until
after she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had left Bursley! Besides, the Peels were always quite aloof
from the ordinary social life of the town. No! He (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not have
suspected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) identity. It was infantile to conceive such a thing.

<p/>And yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inconsequently proceeded in the tangle of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) afflicted
mind, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had suspected it! Supposing by some queer chance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forgotten story, and casually put two and two together!
Supposing even that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) were merely to mention in the Five Towns that
the Pension Frensham was kept by a Mrs. Scales. <div class="bookquote">``Scales? Scales?''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>people might repeat. <div class="bookquote">``Now, what does that remind me of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>And the ball
might roll and roll till Constance or somebody picked it up! And then...

<p/>Moreover--a detail of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had at first unaccountably failed to
mark the significance--this Peel-Swynnerton was a friend of the Mr.
Povey as to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had inquired. In that case it could not be the same
Povey. Impossible that the Peels should be on terms of friendship with
Samuel Povey or his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) connections! But supposing after all they were!
Supposing something utterly unanticipated and revolutionary had
happened in the Five Towns!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was disturbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was insecure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) foresaw inquiries being made
concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) foresaw an immense family fuss, endless tomfoolery,
the upsetting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) existence, the destruction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) calm. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
sank away from that prospect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not face it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) did not want
to face it. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) cried passionately in her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) soul, <div class="bookquote">``I've lived
alone, and I'll stay as I am. I can't change at my time of life.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) attitude towards a possible invasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) solitude became one of
resentment. <div class="bookquote">``I won't have it! I won't have it! I will be left alone.
Constance! What can Constance be to me, or I to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), now?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The vision
of any change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) existence was in the highest degree painful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). And not only painful! It frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>). It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) shrink. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not dismiss it... She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not argue herself out of it. The
apparition of Matthew Peel-Swynnerton had somehow altered the very
stuff of her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) fibres.

<p/>And surging on the outskirts of the central storm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) brain were ten
thousand apprehensions about the management of the Pension. All was
black, hopeless. The Pension might have been the most complete business
failure that gross carelessness and incapacity had ever provoked. Was
it not the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had to supervise everything herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
could depend on no one? Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) to be absent even for a single day the
entire structure would inevitably fall. Instead of working less she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
worked harder. And who could guarantee that her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) investments were safe?

<p/>When dawn announced itself, slowly discovering each object in the
chamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was ill. Fever seemed to rage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) head. And in and
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) mouth she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had strange sensations. Fossette stirred in the
basket near the large desk on which multifarious files and papers were
ranged with minute particularity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fossette!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) tried to call out; but no sound issued from her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) lips.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not move her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) tongue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) tried to protrude it, and could not.
For hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had been conscious of a headache. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) heart sank. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was
sick with fear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) memory flashed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seizure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter! Paralysis! <div class="bookquote">``Ca serait le comble!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) thought in
French, horrified. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) fear became abject! <div class="bookquote">``Can I move at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
thought, and madly jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) head. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could move her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) head
slightly on the pillow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could stretch her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) right arm, both arms.
Absurd cowardice! Of course it was not a seizure! She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) reassured
herself. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not put her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) tongue out. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) began to
hiccough, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had no control over the hiccough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) hand to
the bell, whose ringing would summon the man who slept in a pantry off
the hall, and suddenly the hiccough ceased. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) hand dropped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was
better. Besides, what use in ringing for a man if she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) could not speak
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through the door? She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) must wait for Jacqueline. At six o'clock
every morning, summer and winter, Jacqueline entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) mistress's
bedroom to release the dog for a moment's airing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) own
supervision. The clock on the mantelpiece showed five minutes past
three. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had three hours to wait. Fossette pattered across the room,
and sprang on to the bed and nestled down. Sophia ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), but
Fossette, being herself unwell and torpid, did not seem to care.

<p/>Jacqueline was late. In the quarter of an hour between six o'clock and
a quarter past, Sophia suffered the supreme pangs of despair and verged
upon insanity. It appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cranium would blow off under
pressure from within. Then the door opened silently, a few inches.
Usually Jacqueline came into the room, but sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) stood behind
the door and called in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) soft, trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">``Fossette! Fossette!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And on this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) did not come into the room. The dog did not
immediately respond. Sophia was in an agony. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marshalled all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
volition, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) self-control and strength, to shout:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacqueline!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), a horribly difficult and misshapen birth, but it
came. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was exhausted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madame.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)</div>Jacqueline entered.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had a glimpse of Sophia she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hands. Sophia
stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), wordless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will fetch the doctor--myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)</div>whispered Jacqueline, and fled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacqueline!''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The woman stopped. Then Sophia determined to force
herself to make a speech, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) braced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) muscles to an
unprecedented effort. <div class="bookquote">``Say not a word to the others.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not
bear that the whole household should know of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) illness. Jacqueline
nodded and vanished, the dog following. Jacqueline understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)
lived in the place with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) mistress as with a fellow-conspirator.

<p/>Sophia began to feel better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could get into a sitting posture,
though the movement made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dizzy. By working to the foot of the bed
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could see herself in the glass of the wardrobe. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that
the lower part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face was twisted out of shape.

<p/>The doctor, who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and who earned a lot of money in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) house,
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) frankly what had happened. Paralysie glosso-labio-laryngee was
the phrase he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) used. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) understood. A very slight attack; due to
overwork and worry. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ordered absolute rest and quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, genuinely convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) alone was
indispensable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Repose the most absolute!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marvelled that a few words with a man who chanced to be named
Peel-Swynnerton could have resulted in such a disaster, and drew a
curious satisfaction from this fearful proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was so
highly-strung. But even then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not realize how profoundly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
been disturbed.

<p/>V

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling Sophia--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The inevitable miracle had occurred. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) suspicions concerning that Mr.
Peel-Swynnerton were well-founded, after all! Here was a letter from
Constance! The writing on the envelope was not Constance's; but even
before examining it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had had a peculiar qualm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) received letters
from England nearly every day asking about rooms and prices -LRB-and on
many of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had to pay threepence excess postage, because the
writers carelessly or carefully forgot that a penny stamp was not
sufficient-RRB-; there was nothing to distinguish this envelope, and yet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) first glance at it had startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); and when, deciphering the
smudged post-mark, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made out the word <div class="bookquote">``Bursley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart did
literally seem to stop, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) opened the letter in quite violent
tremulation, thinking to herself: <div class="bookquote">``The doctor would say this is very
bad for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Six days had elapsed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attack, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
wonderfully better; the distortion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face had almost disappeared.
But the doctor was grave; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ordered no medicine, merely a tonic; and
monotonously insisted on `repose the most absolute,'' on perfect mental
calm. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said little else, allowing Sophia to judge from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) silences
the seriousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) condition. Yes, the receipt of such a letter
must be bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) controlled herself while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) read it, lying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dressing-gown
against several pillows on the bed; a mist did not form in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes,
nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sob, nor betray physically that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not reading an
order for two rooms for a week. But the expenditure of nervous force
necessary to self-control was terrific.

<p/>Constance's handwriting had changed; it was, however, easily
recognizable as a development of the neat calligraphy of the girl who
could print window-tickets. The ``S' of Sophia was formed in the same
way as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had formed it in the last letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had received from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at Axe!

<p/>``MY DARLING SOPHIA,

<p/>``I cannot tell you how overjoyed I was to learn that after all these
years you are alive and well, and doing so well too. I long to see you,
my dear sister. It was Mr. Peel-Swynnerton who told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) is a friend
of Cyril's. Cyril is the name of my son. I married Samuel in 1867.
Cyril was born in 1874 at Christmas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) is now twenty-two, and doing
very well in London as a student of sculpture, though so young. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) won
a National Scholarship. There were only eight, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) won one, in
all England. Samuel died in 1888. If you read the papers you must have
seen about the Povey affair. I mean of course Mr. Daniel Povey,
Confectioner. It was that that killed poor Samuel. Poor mother died in
1875. It doesn't seem so long. Aunt Harriet and Aunt Maria are both
dead. Old Dr. Harrop is dead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) son has practically retired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>)
has a partner, a Scotchman. Mr. Critchlow has married Miss Insull. Did
you ever hear of such a thing? They have taken over the shop, and I
live in the house part, the other being bricked up. Business in the
Square is not what it used to be. The steam trams take all the custom
to Hanbridge, and they are talking of electric trams, but I dare say it
is only talk. I have a fairly good servant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Insull</b></font>) has been with me a long
time, but servants are not what they were. I keep pretty well, except
for my sciatica and palpitation. Since Cyril went to London I have been
very lonely. But I try to cheer up and count my blessings. I am sure I
have a great deal to be thankful for. And now this news of you! Please
write to me a long letter, and tell me all about yourself. It is a long
way to Paris. But surely now you know I am still here, you will come
and pay me a visit--at least. Everybody would be most glad to see you.
And I should be so proud and glad. As I say, I am all alone. Mr.
Critchlow says I am to say there is a deal of money waiting for you.
You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) is the trustee. There is the half-share of mother's and
also of Aunt Harriet's, and it has been accumulating. By the way, they
are getting up a subscription for Miss Chetwynd, poor old thing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>)
sister is dead, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Chetwynd</b></font>) is in poverty. I have put myself down for L20.
Now, my dear sister, please do write to me at once. You see it is still
the old address. I remain, my darling Sophia, with much love, your
affectionate sister,

<p/>``CONSTANCE POVEY.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.--I should have written yesterday, but I was not fit. Every time I
sat down to write, I cried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia to Fossette, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) expects me to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),
instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) coming to me! And yet who's the busiest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fossette</b></font>)</div><p/>But this observation was not serious. It was merely a trifle of
affectionate malicious embroidery that Sophia put on the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
deep satisfaction. The very spirit of simple love seemed to emanate
from the paper on which Constance had written. And this spirit woke
suddenly and completely Sophia's love for Constance. Constance! At that
moment there was assuredly for Sophia no creature in the world like
Constance. Constance personified for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the qualities of the Baines
family. Constance's letter was a great letter, a perfect letter,
perfect in its artlessness; the natural expression of the Baines
character at its best. Not an awkward reference in the whole of it! No
clumsy expression of surprise at anything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), Sophia, had done,
or failed to do! No mention of Gerald! Just a sublime acceptance of the
situation as it was, and the assurance of undiminished love! Tact? No;
it was something finer than tact! Tact was conscious, skilful. Sophia
was certain that the notion of tactfulness had not entered Constance's
head. Constance had simply written out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart. And that was what
made the letter so splendid. Sophia was convinced that no one but a
Baines could have written such a letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must rise to
the height of that letter, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) too must show her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) Baines blood. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went primly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) desk, and began to write -LRB-on private notepaper-RRB-
in that imperious large hand of hers that was so different from
Constance's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began a little stiffly, but after a few lines her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
generous and passionate soul was responding freely to the appeal of
Constance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked that Mr. Critchlow should pay L20 for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to the
Miss Chetwynd fund. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) Pension and of Paris, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
pleasure in Constance's letter. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said nothing as to Gerald, nor
as to the possibility of a visit to the Five Towns. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) finished the
letter in a blaze of love, and passed from it as from a dream to the
sterile banality of the daily life of the Pension Frensham, feeling
that, compared to Constance's affection, nothing else had any worth.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not consider the project of going to Bursley. Never,
never would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) go to Bursley. If Constance chose to come to Paris and
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would be delighted, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) herself would not budge. The
mere notion of any change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) existence intimidated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And as for
returning to Bursley itself ... no, no!

<p/>Nevertheless, at the Pension Frensham, the future could not be as the
past. Sophia's health forbade that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that the doctor was right.
Every time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made an effort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew intimately and speedily
that the doctor was right. Only her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) will-power was unimpaired; the
machinery by which will-power is converted into action was mysteriously
damaged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was aware of the fact. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not face it yet. Time
would have to elapse before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could bring herself to face that fact.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was getting an old woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could no longer draw on reserves. Yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) persisted to every one that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was quite recovered, and was
abstaining from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) customary work simply from an excess of prudence.
Certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face had recovered. And the Pension, being a machine all
of whose parts were in order, continued to run, apparently, with its
usual smoothness. It is true that the excellent chef began to peculate,
but as his (<font color='blue'><b>chef</b></font>) cuisine did not suffer, the result was not noticeable for a
long period. The whole staff and many of the guests knew that Sophia
had been indisposed; and they knew no more.

<p/>When by hazard Sophia observed a fault in the daily conduct of the
house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) first impulse was to go to the root of it and cure it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
second was to leave it alone, or to palliate it by some superficial
remedy. Unperceived, and yet vaguely suspected by various people, the
decline of the Pension Frensham had set in. The tide, having risen to
its highest, was receding, but so little that no one could be sure that
it had turned. Every now and then it rushed up again and washed the
furthest stone.

<p/>Sophia and Constance exchanged several letters. Sophia said repeatedly
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not leave Paris. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) roundly asked Constance
to come and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made the suggestion with fear--for the
prospect of actually seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) beloved Constance alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could do no less than make it. And in a few days she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a reply to say
that Constance would have come, under Cyril's charge, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
sciatica was suddenly much worse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was obliged to lie down every
day after dinner to rest her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) legs. Travelling was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).
The fates were combining against Sophia's decision.

<p/>And now Sophia began to ask herself about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) duty to Constance. The
truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was groping round to find an excuse for reversing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) decision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was afraid to reverse it, yet tempted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had the
desire to do something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) objected to doing. It was like the
desire to throw one's self over a high balcony. It drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) drew back against it. The Pension was now tedious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). It
bored her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) even to pretend to be the supervising head of the Pension.
Throughout the house discipline had loosened.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wondered when Mr. Mardon would renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) overtures for the
transformation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) enterprise into a limited company. In spite of
herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would deliberately cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) path and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>)
opportunities to begin on the old theme. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) had never before left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
in peace for so long a period. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) last assault,
absolutely convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) efforts had no smallest chance of
success, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) mind to cease them. With a single word
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could wind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) up again. The merest hint, one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) was
paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) bill, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) would be beseeching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not
utter the word.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) began to say openly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not feel well, that the house
was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and that the doctor had imperatively commanded
rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said this to every one except Mardon. And every one somehow
persisted in not saying it to Mardon. The doctor having advised that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should spend more time in the open air, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would take afternoon
drives in the Bois with Fossette. It was October. But Mr. Mardon never
seemed to hear of those drives.

<p/>One morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in the street outside the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to hear you're so unwell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) said confidentially, after
they had discussed the health of Fossette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So unwell!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed as if resenting the statement. <div class="bookquote">``Who told you
I was so unwell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacqueline. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) told me you often said that what you needed was a
complete change. And it seems the doctor says so, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! doctors!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured, without however denying the truth of
Jacqueline's assertion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) saw hope in Mr. Mardon's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) said, still more confidentially, <div class="bookquote">``if you
SHOULD happen to change your mind, I'm always ready to form a little
syndicate to take this'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) waved discreetly at the Pension--<div class="bookquote">``off your
hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) head violently, which was strange, considering that for
weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had been wishing to hear such words from Mr. Mardon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't give it up altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You could retain your
hold on it. We'd make you manageress, with a salary and a share in the
profits. You'd be mistress just as much as you are now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``IF _I_ GAVE IT UP, _I_ SHOULD GIVE IT UP
ENTIRELY. No half measures for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frensham/Mrs. Frensham</b></font>)</div><p/>With the utterance of that sentence, the history of Frensham's as a
private understanding was brought to a close. Sophia knew it. Mr.
Mardon knew it. Mr. Mardon's heart leapt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) imagination the
formation of the preliminary syndicate, with himself at its head, and
then the re-sale by the syndicate to a limited company at a profit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>)
saw a nice little profit for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) own private personal self of a
thousand or so--gained in a moment. The plant, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) hope, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) had
deemed dead, blossomed with miraculous suddenness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Give it up entirely, then! Take a holiday for life.
You've deserved it, Mrs. Scales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head once again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think it over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave you my answer years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said obstinately, while fearing
lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblige me by thinking it over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll mention it to you again
in a few days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) leave, waddling down the street in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) vague clothes,
conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) fame as Lewis Mardon, the great house-agent of the
Champs Elysees, known throughout Europe and America.

<p/>In a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) did mention it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's only one thing that makes me dream of it even for a moment,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``And that is my sister's health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) exclaimed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mardon</b></font>) did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a sister. Never
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) letters are beginning to worry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) live in Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. In Staffordshire. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has never left home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pride intact she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) led Mr. Mardon to think that
Constance was in a most serious way, whereas in truth Constance had
nothing worse than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sciatica, and even that was somewhat better.

<p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) yielded.




<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>THE MEETING

<p/>I


<p/>Soon after dinner one day in the following spring, Mr. Critchlow
knocked at Constance's door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was seated in the rocking-chair in
front of the fire in the parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wore a large `rough' apron, and
with the outlying parts of the apron she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was rubbing the moisture out
of the coat of a young wire-haired fox-terrier, for whom no more
original name had been found than <div class="bookquote">``Spot.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had a
spot. Constance had more than once called the world to witness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would never have a young dog again, because, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not
be always running about after them, and they ate the stuffing out of
the furniture. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) last dog had lived too long; a dog can do worse
things than eat furniture; and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) natural reaction against age in
dogs, and also in the hope of postponing as long as possible the
inevitable sorrow and upset which death causes when it takes off a
domestic pet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not known how to refuse the very desirable
fox-terrier aged ten months that an acquaintance had offered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).
Spot's beautiful pink skin could be seen under his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) disturbed hair; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
was exquisitely soft to the touch, and to himself he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was loathsome. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
eyes continually peeped forth between corners of the agitated towel,
and they were full of inquietude and shame.

<p/>Amy was assisting at this performance, gravely on the watch to see that
Spot did not escape into the coal-cellar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) opened the door to Mr.
Critchlow's knock. Mr. Critchlow entered without any formalities, as
usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) did not seem to have changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had the same quantity of
white hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) wore the same long white apron, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) voice -LRB-which
showed however an occasional tendency to shrillness-RRB- had the same
grating quality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) stood fairly straight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was carrying a newspaper
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) vellum hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, missis!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do, thank you, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, quietly. Amy went
slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So ye're washing him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance admitted. Spot glanced sharply at the aged man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' ye seen this bit in the paper about Sophia?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) asked, holding the
Signal for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) inspection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About Sophia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Constance. <div class="bookquote">``What's amiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nothing's amiss. But they've got it. It's in the ``Staffordshire day by
day' column. Here! I'll read it ye.<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) drew a long wooden
spectacle-case from his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, and placed a second pair of
spectacles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) nose. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) sat down on the sofa, his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) knees
sticking out pointedly, and read: '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>`We understand that Mrs. Sophia
Scales, proprietress of the famous Pension Frensham in the Rue Lord
Byron, Paris'--it's that famous that nobody in th' Five Towns has ever
heard of it--`is about to pay a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) native town, Bursley,
after an absence of over thirty years. Mrs. Scales belonged to the
well-known and highly respected family of Baines. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) has recently
disposed of the Pension Frensham to a limited company, and we are
betraying no secret in stating that the price paid ran well into five
figures.<div class="bookquote">'' So ye see!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Mr. Critchlow commented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do those Signal people find out things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, bless ye, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow.

<p/>This was an untruth. Mr. Critchlow had himself given the information to
the new editor of the Signal, who had soon been made aware of
Critchlow's passion for the press, and who knew how to make use of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it hadn't appeared just to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't know, I wish it hadn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll be touring on, missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Critchlow/Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Critchlow, meaning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
would go.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) left the paper, and descended the steps with senile deliberation. It
was characteristic that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had shown no curiosity whatever as to the
details of Sophia's arrival.

<p/>Constance removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) apron, wrapped Spot up in it, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in a
corner of the sofa. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) then abruptly sent Amy out to buy a penny
time-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were going by tram to Knype,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>Amy observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have decided to go by train,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, with cold dignity, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had decided the fate of nations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hated such observations
from Amy, who unfortunately lacked, in an increasing degree, the
supreme gift of unquestioning obedience.

<p/>When Amy came breathlessly back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found Constance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bedroom,
withdrawing crumpled balls of paper from the sleeves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) second-best
mantle. Constance scarcely ever wore this mantle. In theory it was
destined for chapel on wet Sundays; in practice it had remained long in
the wardrobe, Sundays having been obstinately fine for weeks and weeks
together. It was a mantle that Constance had never really liked. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not going to Knype to meet Sophia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) everyday mantle; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no intention of donning her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) best mantle for such an excursion.
To make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) first appearance before Sophia in the best mantle she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had--this would have been a sad mistake of tactics! Not only would it
have led to an anti-climax on Sunday, but it would have given to
Constance the air of being in awe of Sophia. Now Constance was in truth
a little afraid of Sophia; in thirty years Sophia might have grown into
anything, whereas Constance had remained just Constance. Paris was a
great place; and it was immensely far off. And the mere sound of that
limited company business was intimidating. Imagine Sophia having by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
own efforts created something which a real limited company wanted to
buy and had bought! Yes, Constance was afraid, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not mean to
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mantle. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the elder. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dignity too--and a lot of it--tucked away in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) secret heart,
hidden within the mildness of that soft exterior. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had decided on
the second-best mantle, which, being seldom used, had its sleeves
stuffed with paper to the end that they might keep their shape and
their <div class="bookquote">``fall.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The little balls of paper were strewed over the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a train at a quarter to three, gets to Knype at ten minutes
past.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy. officiously. <div class="bookquote">``But supposing it was only three minutes
late and the London train was prompt, then you might miss her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Happen
you'd better take the two fifteen to be on the safe side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Please put all this paper in
the wardrobe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would have preferred not to follow Amy's suggestion, but it was so
incontestably wise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was obliged to accept it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless ye go by tram,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``That won't mean starting quite so
soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>But Constance would not go by tram. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took the tram she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would be
bound to meet people who had read the Signal, and who would say, with
their stupid vacuity: <div class="bookquote">``Going to meet your sister at Knype?''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>And then
tiresome conversations would follow. Whereas, in the train, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would
choose a compartment, and would be far less likely to encounter
chatterers.

<p/>There was now not a minute to lose. And the excitement which had been
growing in that house for days past, under a pretence of calm, leapt
out swiftly into the light of the sun, and was unashamed. Amy had to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mistress make herself as comely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could be made without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) best dress, mantle, and bonnet. Amy was frankly consulted as to
effects. The barrier of class was lowered for a space. Many years had
elapsed since Constance had been conscious of a keen desire to look
smart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was reminded of the days when, in full fig for chapel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would dash downstairs on a Sunday morning, and, assuming a pose for
inspection at the threshold of the parlour, would demand of Samuel:
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) used to dash downstairs, like a child, and yet
in those days she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had thought herself so sedate and mature! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sighed,
half with lancinating regret, and half in gentle disdain of that
mercurial creature aged less than thirty. At fifty-one she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) regarded
herself as old. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was old. And Amy had the tricks and manners of
an old spinster. Thus the excitement in the house was an `old'
excitement, and, like Constance's desire to look smart, it had its
ridiculous side, which was also its tragic side, the side that would
have made a boor guffaw, and a hysterical fool cry, and a wise man
meditate sadly upon the earth's fashion of renewing itself.

<p/>At half-past one Constance was dressed, with the exception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
gloves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked at the clock a second time to make sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
might safely glance round the house without fear of missing the train.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went up into the bedroom on the second-floor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and Sophia's old
bedroom, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had prepared with enormous care for Sophia. The
airing of that room had been an enterprise of days, for, save by a
minister during the sittings of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference at
Bursley, it had never been occupied since the era when Maria Insull
used occasionally to sleep in the house. Cyril clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) old room on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) visits. Constance had an ample supply of solid and stately
furniture, and the chamber destined for Sophia was lightened in every
corner by the reflections of polished mahogany. It was also fairly
impregnated with the odour of furniture paste--an odour of which no
housewife need be ashamed. Further, it had been re-papered in a
delicate blue, with one of the new `art' patterns. It was a ``Baines'
room. And Constance did not care where Sophia came from, nor what
Sophia had been accustomed to, nor into what limited company Sophia had
been transformed--that room was adequate! It could not have been
improved upon. You had only to look at the crocheted mats--even those
on the washstand under the white-and-gold ewer and other utensils. It
was folly to expose such mats to the splashings of a washstand, but it
was sublime folly. Sophia might remove them if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cared. Constance was
house-proud; house-pride had slumbered within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); now it blazed forth.

<p/>A fire brightened the drawing-room, which was a truly magnificent
apartment, a museum of valuables collected by the Baines and the
Maddack families since the year 1840, tempered by the latest novelties
in antimacassars and cloths. In all Bursley there could have been few
drawing-rooms to compare with Constance's. Constance knew it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was
not afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) drawing-room being seen by anybody.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) passed for an instant into her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) own bedroom, where Amy was patiently
picking balls of paper from the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you quite understand about tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, 'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, as if to say: <div class="bookquote">``How much oftener are you going
to ask me that question?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you off now, 'm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Come and fasten the front-door after me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They descended together to the parlour. A white cloth for tea lay
folded on the table. It was of the finest damask that skill could
choose and money buy. It was fifteen years old, and had never been
spread. Constance would not have produced it for the first meal, had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) not possessed two other of equal eminence. On the harmonium were
ranged several jams and cakes, a Bursley pork-pie, and some pickled
salmon; with the necessary silver. All was there. Amy could not go
wrong. And crocuses were in the vases on the mantelpiece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``garden,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samuel/Samuel Povey</b></font>)</div>in the phrase which used to cause Samuel to think how extraordinarily
feminine she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was! It was a long time since she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had had a `garden' on
the mantelpiece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) chronic sciatica and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
palpitations had grown at the expense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) interest in gardens.
Often, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had finished the complicated processes by which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
furniture and other goods were kept in order, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had strength only to
<div class="bookquote">``rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was rather a fragile, small, fat woman, soon out of breath,
easily marred. This business of preparing for the advent of Sophia had
appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) genuinely colossal. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had come through it
very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in pretty good health; only a little tired, and more
than a little anxious and nervous, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gave the last glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take away that apron, do!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to Amy, pointing to the rough
apron in the corner of the sofa. <div class="bookquote">``By the way, where is Spot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Spot, m'm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>Amy ejaculated.

<p/>Both their hearts jumped. Amy instinctively looked out of the window.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was there, sure enough, in the gutter, studying the
indescribabilities of King Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had obviously escaped when Amy
came in from buying the time-table. The woman's face was guilty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy, I wonder AT you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Constance, tragically. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) opened the
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never did see the like of that dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>murmured Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spot!''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mistress commanded. <div class="bookquote">``Come here at once. Do you hear me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Spot turned sharply and gazed motionless at Constance. Then with a toss
of the head he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) dashed off to the corner of the Square, and gazed
motionless again. Amy went forth to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). After an age she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) in, squealing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was in a state exceedingly offensive to the eye
and to the nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had effectively got rid of the smell of soap, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) loathed. Constance could have wept. It did really appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that
nothing had gone right that day. And Spot had the most innocent,
trustful air. Impossible to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) realize that his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) aunt Sophia was
coming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would have sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) entire family into servitude in order to
buy ten yards of King Street gutter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must wash him (<font color='blue'><b>front-door</b></font>) in the scullery, that's all there is for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said
Constance, controlling herself. <div class="bookquote">``Put that apron on, and don't forget
one of your new aprons when you open the door. Better shut him (<font color='blue'><b>front-door</b></font>) up in
Mr. Cyril's bedroom when you've dried him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went, charged with worries, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bag and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) umbrella
and smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gloves, and spying downwards at the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
mantle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a funny way to go to Bursley Station, that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy,
observing that Constance was descending King Street instead of crossing
it into Wedgwood Street. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) caught Spot 'a fair clout on the
head,'' to indicate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) alone in the house now.

<p/>Constance was taking a round-about route to the station, so that, if
stopped by acquaintances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should not be too obviously going to the
station. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feelings concerning the arrival of Sophia, and concerning
the town's attitude towards it, were very complex.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was forced to hurry. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had risen that morning with plans
perfectly contrived for the avoidance of hurry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) disliked hurry
because it always `put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) about.''

<p/>II

<p/>The express from London was late, so that Constance had three-quarters
of an hour of the stony calmness of Knype platform when it is waiting
for a great train. At last the porters began to cry, <div class="bookquote">``Macclesfield,
Stockport, and Manchester train;''  (<font color='red'><b>the porters</b></font>)</div>the immense engine glided round the
curve, dwarfing the carriages behind it, and Constance had a supreme
tremor. The calmness of the platform was transformed into a melee.
Little Constance found herself left on the fringe of a physically
agitated crowd which was apparently trying to scale a precipice
surmounted by windows and doors from whose apertures looked forth
defenders of the train. Knype platform seemed as if it would never be
reduced to order again. And Constance did not estimate highly the
chances of picking out an unknown Sophia from that welter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was very
seriously perturbed. All the muscles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face were drawn as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze
wandered anxiously from end to end of the train.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw a singular dog. Other people also saw it. It was of
the colour of chocolate; it had a head and shoulders richly covered
with hair that hung down in thousands of tufts like the tufts of a
modern mop such as is bought in shops. This hair stopped suddenly
rather less than halfway along the length of the dog's body, the
remainder of which was naked and as smooth as marble. The effect was to
give to the inhabitants of the Five Towns the impression that the dog
had forgotten an essential part of its attire and was outraging
decency. The ball of hair which had been allowed to grow on the dog's
tail, and the circles of hair which ornamented its ankles, only served
to intensify the impression of indecency. A pink ribbon round its neck
completed the outrage. The animal had absolutely the air of a decked
trollop. A chain ran taut from the creature's neck into the middle of a
small crowd of persons gesticulating over trunks, and Constance traced
it to a tall and distinguished woman in a coat and skirt with a rather
striking hat. A beautiful and aristocratic woman, Constance thought, at
a distance! Then the strange idea came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``That's Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
sure... She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not sure... She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sure. The woman emerged from the
crowd. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye fell on Constance. They both hesitated, and, as it were,
wavered uncertainly towards each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have known you anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with apparently
careless tranquillity, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stooped to kiss Constance, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
veil.

<p/>Constance saw that this marvellous tranquillity must be imitated, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) imitated it very well. It was a ``Baines' tranquillity. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
noticed a twitching of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) sister's lips. The twitching comforted
Constance, proving to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was not alone in foolishness. There
was also something queer about the permanent lines of Sophia's mouth.
That must be due to the `attack' about which Sophia had written.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Cyril meet you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Constance. It was all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could think
of to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``And I went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) studio, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) saw
me off at Euston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) is a VERY nice boy. I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said ``I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)' with the intonation of Sophia aged fifteen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
tone and imperious gesture sent Constance flying back to the `sixties.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hasn't altered one bit,'' Constance thought with joy. ``Nothing
could change Sophia.'' And at the back of that notion was a more general
notion: <div class="bookquote">``Nothing could change a Baines.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was true that Constance's
Sophia had not changed. Powerful individualities remain undisfigured by
no matter what vicissitudes. After this revelation of the original
Sophia, arising as it did out of praise of Cyril, Constance felt
easier, felt reassured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Fossette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, pulling at the chain.

<p/>Constance knew not what to reply. Surely Sophia could not be aware what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did in bringing such a dog to a place where people were so
particular as they are in the Five Towns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fossette!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) repeated the name in an endearing accent, half stooping
towards the dog. After all, it was not the dog's fault. Sophia had
certainly mentioned a dog in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) letters, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not prepared
Constance for the spectacle of Fossette.

<p/>All that happened in a moment. A porter appeared with two trunks
belonging to Sophia. Constance observed that they were superlatively
`good' trunks; also that Sophia's clothes, though `on the showy side,''
were superlatively <div class="bookquote">``good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>The getting of Sophia's ticket to Bursley
occupied them next, and soon the first shock of meeting had worn off.

<p/>In a second-class compartment of the Loop Line train, with Sophia and
Fossette opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), Constance had leisure to `take in' Sophia.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) came to the conclusion that, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) slenderness and
straightness and the general effect of the long oval of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face under
the hat, Sophia looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that Sophia must have been
through a great deal; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) experiences were damagingly printed in the
details of feature. Seen at a distance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have passed for a
woman of thirty, even for a girl, but seen across a narrow railway
carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a woman whom suffering had aged. Yet obviously her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
spirit was unbroken. Hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tell a doubtful porter that of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
should take Fossette with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into the carriage! See her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shut the
carriage door with the expressed intention of keeping other people out!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was accustomed to command. At the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face had an almost
set smile, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``I will die smiling.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Constance felt sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). While recognizing in Sophia a superior in
charm, in experience, in knowledge of the world and in force of
personality, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) yet with a kind of undisturbed, fundamental
superiority felt sorry for Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, absently fingering Fossette. ``A man
came up to me at Euston, while Cyril was getting my ticket, and said,
``Eh, Miss Baines, I haven't seen ye for over thirty years, but I know
you're Miss Baines, or WERE--and you're looking bonny.<div class="bookquote">'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) went
off. I think it must have been Holl, the grocer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Baines/Baines</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) got a long white beard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it was Mr. Holl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>)'s been Mayor twice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>)'s an alderman, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``But wasn't it queer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! Bless us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Don't talk about queer! It's
terrible how time flies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation stopped, and it refused to start again. Two women who
are full of affectionate curiosity about each other, and who have not
seen each other for thirty years, and who are anxious to confide in
each other, ought to discover no difficulty in talking; but somehow
these two could not talk. Constance perceived that Sophia was impeded
by the same awkwardness as herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>cried Sophia, suddenly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had glanced out of the
window and had seen two camels and an elephant in a field close to the
line, amid manufactories and warehouses and advertisements of soap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``That's Barnum's, you know. They have what they
call a central depot here, because it's the middle of England.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance spoke proudly. -LRB-After all, there can be only one middle.-RRB- It
was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tongue to say, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) `tart' manner, that Fossette ought to
be with the camels, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refrained. Sophia hit on the excellent idea
of noting all the buildings that were new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and all the landmarks
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered. It was surprising how little the district had
altered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Same smoke!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Same smoke!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's even worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance was slightly piqued. <div class="bookquote">``But they're doing
something now for smoke abatement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must have forgotten how dirty it was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
that's it. I'd no idea...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. Then, in candid admission, <div class="bookquote">``The fact is, it
is dirty. You can't imagine what work it makes, especially with
window-curtains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>As the train puffed under Trafalgar Road, Constance pointed to a new
station that was being built there, to be called ``Trafalgar Road'
station.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it be strange?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), accustomed to the eternal sequence of
Loop Lane stations--Turnhill, Bursley, Bleakridge, Hanbridge, Cauldon,
Knype, Trent Vale, and Longshaw. A ``Trafalgar Road' inserting itself
between Bleakridge and Hanbridge seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hanbridge</b></font>) excessively curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But of course it's not the same to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, dashed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
indicated the glories of Bursley Park, as the train slackened for
Bursley, with modesty. Sophia gazed, and vaguely recognized the slopes
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) first walk with Gerald Scales.

<p/>Nobody accosted them at Bursley Station, and they drove to the Square
in a cab. Amy was at the window; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) held up Spot, who was in a plenary
state of cleanliness, rivalling the purity of Amy's apron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, officiously, to Sophia, as Sophia came
up the steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia replied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flattered Amy in thus
showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) name; but if ever a servant
was put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) place by mere tone, Amy was put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) place on that
occasion. Constance trembled at Sophia's frigid and arrogant
politeness. Certainly Sophia was not used to being addressed first by
servants. But Amy was not quite the ordinary servant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was much
older than the ordinary servant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had acquired a partial moral
dominion over Constance, though Constance would have warmly denied it.
Hence Constance's apprehension. However, nothing happened. Amy
apparently did not feel the snub.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take Spot and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Hanbridge</b></font>) in Mr. Cyril's bedroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), as if implying: <div class="bookquote">``Have I not already told you to do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The fact
was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was afraid for Spot's life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Fossette!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) welcomed the incoming poodle kindly; the poodle
began at once to sniff.

<p/>The fat, red cabman was handling the trunks on the pavement, and Amy
was upstairs. For a moment the sisters were alone together in the
parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So here I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the tall, majestic woman of fifty. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
lips twitched again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked round the room--so small to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance agreed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lip, and, as a
measure of prudence to avoid breaking down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bustled out to the
cabman. A passing instant of emotion, like a fleck of foam on a wide
and calm sea!

<p/>The cabman blundered up and downstairs with trunks, and saluted
Sophia's haughty generosity, and then there was quietness. Amy was
already brewing the tea in the cave. The prepared tea-table in front of
the fire made a glittering array.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what about Fossette?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance voiced anxieties that had been
growing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fossette will be quite right with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, firmly.

<p/>They ascended to the guest's room, which drew Sophia's admiration for
its prettiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hurried to the window and looked out into the
Square.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like a fire?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked, in a rather perfunctory
manner. For a bedroom fire, in seasons of normal health, was still
regarded as absurd in the Square.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia; but with a slight failure to rebut the
suggestion as utterly ridiculous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance questioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll leave you. I expect Amy will have tea ready directly.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
went down into the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as soon as we've finished
tea, light a fire in Mrs. Scales's bedroom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the top bedroom, m'm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance climbed again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own bedroom, and shut the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
needed a moment to herself, in the midst of this terrific affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
sighed with relief as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mantle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``At any rate
we've met, and I've got her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)'s very nice. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) isn't a bit
altered.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hesitated to admit that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) Sophia was the least in
the world formidable. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said once more: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)'s very nice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
isn't a bit altered.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then: <div class="bookquote">``Fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) being here! She (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) really is
here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) perfect simplicity it did not occur to Constance to
speculate as to what Sophia thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>Sophia was downstairs first, and Constance found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looking at the
blank wall beyond the door leading to the kitchen steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So this is where you had it bricked up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``That's the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel like people feel when they have tickling in a limb
that's been cut off!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sophia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div><p/>The tea received a great deal of praise from Sophia, but neither of
them ate much. Constance found that Sophia was like herself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had to
be particular about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) food. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tasted dainties for the sake of
tasting, but it was a bird's pecking. Not the twelfth part of the tea
was consumed. They dared not indulge caprices. Only their eyes could
feed.

<p/>After tea they went up to the drawing-room, and in the corridor had the
startling pleasure of seeing two dogs who scurried about after each
other in amity. Spot had found Fossette, with the aid of Amy's
incurable carelessness, and had at once examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with great
particularity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seemed to be of an amiable disposition, and not
averse from the lighter distractions. For a long time the sisters sat
chatting together in the lit drawing-room to the agreeable sound of
happy dogs playing in the dark corridor. Those dogs saved the
situation, because they needed constant attention. When the dogs dozed,
the sisters began to look through photograph albums, of which Constance
had several, bound in plush or morocco. Nothing will sharpen the
memory, evoke the past, raise the dead, rejuvenate the ageing, and
cause both sighs and smiles, like a collection of photographs gathered
together during long years of life. Constance had an astonishing
menagerie of unknown cousins and their connections, and of townspeople;
she (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) had Cyril at all ages; she (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) had weird daguerreotypes of her (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) parents
and their parents. The strangest of all was a portrait of Samuel Povey
as an infant in arms. Sophia checked an impulse to laugh at it. But
when Constance said: <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it funny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did allow herself to laugh.
A photograph of Samuel in the year before his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) death was really
imposing. Sophia stared at it, impressed. It was the portrait of an
honest man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have you been a widow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked in a low voice,
glancing at upright Sophia over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spectacles, a leaf of the album
raised against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) finger.

<p/>Sophia unmistakably flushed. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I am a widow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), with an air. <div class="bookquote">``My husband left me in 1870, and I've never seen nor
heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Constance, alarmed and deafened as by a clap of
awful thunder. <div class="bookquote">``I thought ye were a widow. Mr. Peel-Swynnerton said he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)
was told positively ye were a widow. That's why I never...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
stopped. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face was troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I always passed for a widow, over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I see...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I may be a widow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>Constance made no remark. This was a blow. Bursley was such a
particular place. Doubtless, Gerald Scales had behaved like a
scoundrel. That was sure!

<p/>When, immediately afterwards, Amy opened the drawing-room door -LRB-having
first knocked--the practice of encouraging a servant to plunge without
warning of any kind into a drawing-room had never been favoured in that
house-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw the sisters sitting rather near to each other at the
walnut oval table, Mrs. Scales very upright, and staring into the fire,
and Mrs. Povey `bunched up' and staring at the photograph album; both
seeming to Amy aged and apprehensive; Mrs. Povey's hair was quite grey,
though Mrs. Scales' hair was nearly as black as Amy's own. Mrs. Scales
started at the sound of the knock, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Mr. and Mrs. Critchlow, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>announced Amy.

<p/>The sisters glanced at one another, with lifted foreheads. Then Mrs.
Povey spoke to Amy as though visits at half-past eight at night were a
customary phenomenon of the household. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) trembled to
think what outrageous thing Mr. Critchlow might say to Sophia after
thirty years' absence. The occasion was great, and it might also be
terrible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask them to come up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said calmly.

<p/>But Amy had the best of that encounter. <div class="bookquote">``I have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) replied, and
instantly produced them out of the darkness of the corridor. It was
providential: the sisters had made no remark that the Critchlows might
not hear.

<p/>Then Maria Critchlow, simpering, had to greet Sophia. Mrs. Critchlow
was very agitated, from sheer nervousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) curvetted; she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) almost
pranced; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) made noises with her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) mouth as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) saw some one
eating a sour apple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) wanted to show Sophia how greatly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
changed from the young, timid apprentice. Certainly since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marriage
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had changed. As manager of other people's business she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not felt
the necessity of being effusive to customers, but as proprietress,
anxiety to succeed had dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) capable and mechanical
indifference. It was a pity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) consistent dullness had had a sort of
dignity; but genial, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was merely ridiculous. Animation cruelly
displayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) appalling commonness and physical shabbiness. Sophia's
demeanour was not chilly; but it indicated that Sophia had no wish to
be eyed over as a freak of nature.

<p/>Mr. Critchlow advanced very slowly into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Ye still carry your
head on a stiff neck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>), deliberately examining Sophia. Then
with great care he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) long thin arm and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
I'm rare and glad to see ye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Every one was thunderstruck at this expression of joy. Mr. Critchlow
had never been known to be glad to see anybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>twittered Maria, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Critchlow would come in to-night. Nothing
would do but he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) must come in to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't tell me this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, <div class="bookquote">``that you were
going to give us the pleasure of your company like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) looked momentarily at Constance. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) grated, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know as I
did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) gaze flattered Sophia. Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) treated this experienced and
sad woman of fifty as a young girl. And in presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) extreme age
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt like a young girl, remembering the while how as a young girl
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). Repulsing the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) arranged an
armchair in front of the fire and meticulously put himself into it.
Assuredly he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was much older in a drawing-room than behind the counter
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) shop. Constance had noticed that in the afternoon. A live coal
fell out of the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) bent forward, wet his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) fingers, picked up the
coal and threw it back into the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have done that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw Mr. Critchlow's equal for picking up hot cinders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Maria
giggled.

<p/>Mr. Critchlow deigned no remark. <div class="bookquote">``When did ye leave this Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
demanded of Sophia, leaning back, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) hands on the arms of
the chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what'n ye been doing with yeself since yesterday morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I spent last night in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, in London, did ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Cyril and I had an evening together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh? Cyril! What's yer opinion o' Cyril, Sophia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very proud to have Cyril for a nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Are ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man was obviously ironic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia insisted sharply. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to hear a word said
against Cyril.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) proceeded to an enthusiastic laudation of Cyril which rather
overwhelmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother. Constance was pleased; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was delighted. And
yet somewhere in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind was an uncomfortable feeling that Cyril,
having taken a fancy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) brilliant aunt, had tried to charm her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) seldom or never tried to charm his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother. Cyril and Sophia had
dazzled and conquered each other; they were of the same type; whereas
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), Constance, being but a plain person, could not glitter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rang the bell and gave instructions to Amy about food--fruit cakes,
coffee and hot milk, on a tray; and Sophia also spoke to Amy murmuring
a request as to Fossette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Scales,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, with eager deference.

<p/>Mrs. Critchlow smiled vaguely from a low chair near the curtained
window. Then Constance lit another burner of the chandelier. In doing
so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) gave a little sigh; it was a sigh of relief. Mr. Critchlow had
behaved himself. Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) and Sophia had met, the worst was over.
Had Constance known beforehand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would pay a call, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have
been agonized by apprehensions, but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had actually come she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had come.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had silently sipped some hot milk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) drew a thick bunch of
papers, white and blue, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) bulging breast-pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Maria Critchlow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) called, edging round his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) chair slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Ye'd best go back home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria Critchlow was biting at a bit of walnut cake, while in her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) right
hand, all seamed with black lines, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) held a cup of coffee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Critchlow--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got business with Sophia, and I must get it done. I've got for to
render an account of my stewardship to Sophia, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father's will,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother's will, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) aunt's will, and it's nobody's business
but mine and Sophia's, I reckon. Now then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) wife,
<div class="bookquote">``off with ye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria rose, half-kittenish and half-ashamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you don't want to go into all that to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
spoke softly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had already fully perceived that Mr. Critchlow
must be managed with the tact which the capricious obstinacies of
advanced age demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Surely you can wait a day or two. I'm in no
hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HAVEN'T I WAITED LONG ENOUGH?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) retorted fiercely.

<p/>There was a pause. Maria Critchlow moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for you being in no hurry, Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man went on, <div class="bookquote">``nobody
can say as you've been in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia had suffered a check. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glanced hesitatingly at Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Critchlow and I will go down into the parlour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance,
quickly. <div class="bookquote">``There is a bit of fire there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. I won't hear of such a thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we will, won't we, Mrs. Critchlow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance insisted,
cheerfully but firmly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was determined that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) house Sophia
should have all the freedom and conveniences that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could have had in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own. If a private room was needed for discussions between Sophia
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) trustee, Constance's pride was piqued to supply that room.
Further, Constance was glad to get Maria out of Sophia's sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
accustomed to Maria; with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) it did not matter; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) did not care
that the teeth of Sophia should be set on edge by the ridiculous
demeanour of Maria. So those two left the drawing-room, and the old man
began to open the papers which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been preparing for weeks.

<p/>There was very little fire in the parlour, and Constance, in addition
to being bored by Mrs. Critchlow's inane and inquisitive remarks, felt
chilly, which was bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) sciatica. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) wondered whether Sophia
would have to confess to Mr. Critchlow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not certainly a
widow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought that steps ought to be taken to ascertain, through
Birkinshaws, if anything was known of Gerald Scales. But even that
course was set with perils. Supposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) still lived, an
unspeakable villain -LRB-Constance could only think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) as an
unspeakable villain-RRB-, and supposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) molested Sophia,--what
scenes! What shame in the town! Such frightful thoughts ran endlessly
through Constance's mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bent over the fire endeavouring to keep
alive a silly conversation with Maria Critchlow.

<p/>Amy passed through the parlour to go to bed. There was no other way of
reaching the upper part of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to bed, Amy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Fossette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the kitchen, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, defending herself. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Scales told
me the dog might sleep in the kitchen with Spot, as they was such good
friends. I've opened the bottom drawer, and Fossit is lying in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Scales has brought a dog with her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, drily, before Constance could answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) implied
everything in that affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a family for dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Maria. <div class="bookquote">``What sort of dog is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know exactly what they call it. It's a
French dog, one of those French dogs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>Amy was lingering at the
stairfoot. <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Amy, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy ascended, shutting the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>Maria muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>trustee beneficiary</b></font>)</div><p/>It was ten o'clock before sounds above indicated that the first
interview between trustee and beneficiary was finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be going on to open our side-door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Critchlow</b></font>)</div>said Maria. <div class="bookquote">``Say good night
to Mrs. Scales for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was not sure whether Charles Critchlow had
really meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to go home, or whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mere absence from the
drawing-room had contented him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) departed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) came down the
stairs with the most tiresome slowness, went through the parlour in
silence, ignoring Constance, and also Sophia, who was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) heels, and
vanished.

<p/>As Constance shut and bolted the front-door, the sisters looked at each
other, Sophia faintly smiling. It seemed to them that they understood
each other better when they did not speak. With a glance, they
exchanged their ideas on the subject of Charles Critchlow and Maria,
and learnt that their ideas were similar. Constance said nothing as to
the private interview. Nor did Sophia. At present, on this the first
day, they could only achieve intimacy by intermittent flashes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>Sophia got to the stairs, which received a little light from the
corridor gas, before Constance, having tested the window-fastening,
turned out the gas in the parlour. They climbed the lower flight of
stairs together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must just see that your room is all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia smiled.

<p/>They climbed the second flight, slowly. Constance was out of breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a fire! How nice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>cried Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``But why did you go to all that
trouble? I told you not to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no trouble at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, raising the gas in the
bedroom. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone implied that bedroom fires were a quite ordinary
incident of daily life in a place like Bursley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I hope you'll find everything comfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said
Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I shall. Good night, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked at each other again, with timid affectionateness. They did
not kiss. The thought in both their minds was: <div class="bookquote">``We couldn't keep on
kissing every day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But there was a vast amount of quiet, restrained
affection, of mutual confidence and respect, even of tenderness, in
their tones.

<p/>About half an hour later a dreadful hullaballoo smote the ear of
Constance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was just getting into bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) listened intently, in
great alarm. It was undoubtedly those dogs fighting, and fighting to
the death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pictured the kitchen as a battlefield, and Spot slain.
Opening the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stepped out into the corridor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Constance,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said a low voice above her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) jumped. <div class="bookquote">``Is that you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't bother to go down to the dogs; they'll stop in a moment.
Fossette won't bite. I'm so sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s upsetting the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance stared upwards, and discerned a pale shadow. The dogs did
soon cease their altercation. This short colloquy in the dark affected
Constance strangely.

<p/>III

<p/>The next morning, after a night varied by periods of wakefulness not
unpleasant, Sophia arose and, taking due precautions against cold, went
to the window. It was Saturday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had left Paris on the Thursday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
looked forth upon the Square, holding aside the blind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
expected, of course, to find that the Square had shrunk in size; but
nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was startled to see how small it was. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
scarcely bigger than a courtyard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could remember a winter morning
when from the window she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had watched the Square under virgin snow in
the lamplight, and the Square had been vast, and the first wayfarer,
crossing it diagonally and leaving behind him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) the irregular impress of
his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) feet, had appeared to travel for hours over an interminable white
waste before vanishing past Holl's shop in the direction of the Town
Hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chiefly recalled the Square under snow; cold mornings, and
the coldness of the oil-cloth at the window, and the draught of cold
air through the ill-fitting sash -LRB-it was put right now-RRB-! These visions
of herself seemed beautiful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) childish existence seemed
beautiful; the storms and tempests of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) girlhood seemed beautiful;
even the great sterile expanse of tedium when, after giving up a
scholastic career, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had served for two years in the shop--even this
had a strange charm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) memory.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought that not for millions of pounds would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) live her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life
over again.

<p/>In its contents the Square had not surprisingly changed during the
immense, the terrifying interval that separated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) virginity.
On the east side, several shops had been thrown into one, and forced
into a semblance of eternal unity by means of a coat of stucco. And
there was a fountain at the north end which was new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). No other
constructional change! But the moral change, the sad declension from
the ancient proud spirit of the Square--this was painfully depressing.
Several establishments lacked tenants, had obviously lacked tenants for
a long time; ``To let' notices hung in their stained and dirty upper
windows, and clung insecurely to their closed shutters. And on the
sign-boards of these establishments were names that Sophia did not
know. The character of most of the shops seemed to have worsened; they
had become pettifogging little holes, unkempt, shabby, poor; they had
no brightness, no feeling of vitality. And the floor of the Square was
littered with nondescript refuse. The whole scene, paltry, confined,
and dull, reached for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the extreme of provinciality. It was what the
French called, with a pregnant intonation, la province. This--being
said, there was nothing else to say. Bursley, of course, was in the
provinces; Bursley must, in the nature of things, be typically
provincial. But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind it had always been differentiated from the
common province; it had always had an air, a distinction, and
especially St. Luke's Square! That illusion was now gone. Still, the
alteration was not wholly in herself; it was not wholly subjective. The
Square really had changed for the worse; it might not be smaller, but
it had deteriorated. As a centre of commerce it had assuredly
approached very near to death. On a Saturday morning thirty years ago
it would have been covered with linen-roofed stalls, and chattering
country-folk, and the stir of bargains. Now, Saturday morning was like
any other morning in the Square, and the glass-roof of St. Luke's
market in Wedgwood Street, which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could see from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) window, echoed
to the sounds of noisy commerce. In that instance business had simply
moved a few yards to the east; but Sophia knew, from hints in
Constance's letters and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) talk, that business in general had moved
more than a few yards, it had moved a couple of miles--to arrogant and
pushing Hanbridge, with its electric light and its theatres and its
big, advertising shops. The heaven of thick smoke over the Square, the
black deposit on painted woodwork, the intermittent hooting of steam
syrens, showed that the wholesale trade of Bursley still flourished.
But Sophia had no memories of the wholesale trade of Bursley; it meant
nothing to the youth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was attached by intimate links
to the retail traffic of Bursley, and as a mart old Bursley was done
for.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``It would kill me if I had to live here. It's deadening.
It weighs on you. And the dirt, and the horrible ugliness! And the--way
they talk, and the way they think! I felt it first at Knype station.
The Square is rather picturesque, but it's such a poor, poor little
thing! Fancy having to look at it every morning of one's life! No!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
almost shuddered.

<p/>For the time being she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no home. To Constance she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was `paying a
visit.''

<p/>Constance did not appear to realize the awful conditions of dirt,
decay, and provinciality in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was living. Even Constance's
house was extremely inconvenient, dark, and no doubt unhealthy.
Cellar-kitchen, no hall, abominable stairs, and as to hygiene, simply
mediaeval. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not understand why Constance had remained in the
house. Constance had plenty of money and might live where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liked,
and in a good modern house. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stayed in the Square. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)'s got used to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia thought leniently. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay I should be
just the same in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) place.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not really think so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could not understand Constance's state of mind.

<p/>Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not claim to have `added up' Constance yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
considered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister was in some respects utterly
provincial--what they used to call in the Five Towns a <div class="bookquote">``body.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Somewhat
too diffident, not assertive enough, not erect enough; with curious
provincial pronunciations, accents, gestures, mannerisms, and
inarticulate ejaculations; with a curious narrowness of outlook! But at
the same time Constance was very shrewd, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was often proving by
some bit of a remark that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew what was what, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
provinciality. In judgments upon human nature they undoubtedly thought
alike, and there was a strong natural general sympathy between them.
And at the bottom of Constance was something fine. At intervals Sophia
discovered herself secretly patronizing Constance, but reflection would
always cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to cease from patronage and to examine her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own
defences. Constance, besides being the essence of kindness, was no
fool. Constance could see through a pretence, an absurdity, as quickly
as any one. Constance did honestly appear to Sophia to be superior to
any Frenchwoman that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had ever encountered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw supreme in
Constance that quality which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had recognized in the porters at
Newhaven on landing--the quality of an honest and naive goodwill, of
powerful simplicity. That quality presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as the
greatest in the world, and it seemed to be in the very air of England.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could even detect it in Mr. Critchlow, whom, for the rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
liked, admiring the brutal force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pardoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
brutality to his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found it proper. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hadn't married her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), what would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) have been? Nothing but
a slave! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)'s infinitely better off as his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) wife. In fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)'s lucky.
And it would be absurd for him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) otherwise than he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) does
treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Sophia did not divine that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) masterful Critchlow had
once wanted Maria as one might want a star.-RRB-

<p/>But to be always with such people! To be always with Constance! To be
always in the Bursley atmosphere, physical and mental!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pictured Paris as it would be on that very morning--bright, clean,
glittering; the neatness of the Rue Lord Byron, and the magnificent
slanting splendour of the Champs Elysees. Paris had always seemed
beautiful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); but the life of Paris had not seemed beautiful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Yet now it did seem beautiful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could delve down into the
earlier years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ownership of the Pension, and see a regular,
placid beauty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) daily life there. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life there, even so late as
a fortnight ago, seemed beautiful; sad, but beautiful. It had passed
into history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sighed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought of the innumerable interviews
with Mardon, the endless formalities required by the English and the
French law and by the particularity of the Syndicate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been
through all that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had actually been through it and it was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had bought the Pension for a song and sold it for great riches. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
developed from a nobody into the desired of Syndicates. And after long,
long, monotonous, strenuous years of possession the day had come, the
emotional moment had come, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had yielded up the keys of
ownership to Mr. Mardon and a man from the Hotel Moscow, and had paid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) servants for the last time and signed the last receipted bill. The
men had been very gallant, and had requested her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to stay in the Pension
as their guest until she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was ready to leave Paris. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had declined
that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not have borne to remain in the Pension under the reign
of another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had left at once and gone to a hotel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) few goods
while finally disposing of certain financial questions. And one evening
Jacqueline had come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>), and had wept.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) exit from the Pension Frensham struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) now as poignantly
pathetic, in its quickness and its absence of ceremonial. Ten steps,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) career was finished, closed. Astonishing with what liquid
tenderness she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) turned and looked back on that hard, fighting,
exhausting life in Paris! For, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had unconsciously liked it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had never enjoyed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had always compared France
disadvantageously with England, always resented the French temperament
in business, always been convinced that `you never knew where you were'
with French tradespeople. And now they flitted before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) endowed with
a wondrous charm; so polite in their lying, so eager to spare your
feelings and to reassure you, so neat and prim. And the French shops,
so exquisitely arranged! Even a butcher's shop in Paris was a pleasure
to the eye, whereas the butcher's shop in Wedgwood Street, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)
remembered of old, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had glimpsed from the cab--what a
bloody shambles! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) longed for Paris again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) longed to stretch her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>)
lungs in Paris. These people in Bursley did not suspect what Paris was.
They did not appreciate and they never would appreciate the marvels
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had accomplished in a theatre of marvels. They probably never
realized that the whole of the rest of the world was not more or less
like Bursley. They had no curiosity. Even Constance was a thousand
times more interested in relating trifles of Bursley gossip than in
listening to details of life in Paris. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) had expressed a
mild, vapid surprise at things told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) by Sophia; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) was not
really impressed, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) curiosity did not extend beyond Bursley.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>), like the rest, had the formidable, thrice-callous egotism of the
provinces. And if Sophia had informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that the heads of Parisians
grew out of their navels she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have murmured: <div class="bookquote">``Well, well! Bless
us! I never heard of such things! Mrs. Brindley's second boy has got
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head quite crooked, poor little fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Why should Sophia feel sorrowful? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was free; free
to go where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liked and do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liked, She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no
responsibilities, no cares. The thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) husband had long ago
ceased to rouse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) any feeling of any kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was rich. Mr.
Critchlow had accumulated for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) about as much money as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
herself acquired. Never could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) income! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know
how to spend it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lacked nothing that was procurable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no
desires except the direct desire for happiness. If thirty thousand
pounds or so could have bought a son like Cyril, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have bought
one for herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bitterly regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no child. In this,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) envied Constance. A child seemed to be the one commodity worth
having. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was too free, too exempt from responsibilities. In spite of
Constance she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was alone in the world. The strangeness of the hazards of
life overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was at fifty, alone.

<p/>But the idea of leaving Constance, having once rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), did not
please Sophia. It disquieted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not see herself living away
from Constance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was alone--but Constance was there.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was downstairs first, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a little conversation with Amy.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stood on the step of the front-door while Fossette made a
preliminary inspection of Spot's gutter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found the air nipping.

<p/>Constance, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) descended, saw stretching across one side of the
breakfast-table an umbrella, Sophia's present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from Paris. It was
an umbrella such that a better could not be bought. It would have
impressed even Aunt Harriet. The handle was of gold, set with a circlet
of opalines. The tips of the ribs were also of gold. It was this detail
which staggered Constance. Frankly, this development of luxury had been
unknown and unsuspected in the Square. That the tips of the ribs should
match the handle ... that did truly beat everything! Sophia said calmly
that the device was quite common. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not conceal that the
umbrella was strictly of the highest class and that it might be shown
to queens without shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) intimated that the frame -LRB-a ``Fox's
Paragon'-RRB-, handle, and tips, would outlast many silks. Constance was
childish with pleasure.

<p/>They decided to go out marketing together. The unspoken thought in
their minds was that as Sophia would have to be introduced to the town
sooner or later, it might as well be sooner. Constance looked at the
sky. <div class="bookquote">``It can't possibly rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I shall take my umbrella.''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>TOWARDS HOTEL LIFE

<p/>I


<p/>SOPHIA wore list slippers in the morning. It was a habit which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
formed in the Rue Lord Byron--by accident rather than with an intention
to utilize list slippers for the effective supervision of servants.
These list slippers were the immediate cause of important happenings in
St. Luke's Square. Sophia had been with Constance one calendar
month--it was, of course, astonishing how quickly the time had
passed!--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had become familiar with the house. Restraint had
gradually ceased to mark the relations of the sisters. Constance, in
particular, hid nothing from Sophia, who was made aware of the minor
and major defects of Amy and all the other creakings of the household
machine. Meals were eaten off the ordinary tablecloths, and on the days
for `turning out' the parlour, Constance assumed, with a little laugh,
that Sophia would excuse Amy's apron, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not had time to
change. In brief, Sophia was no longer a stranger, and nobody felt
bound to pretend that things were not exactly what they were. In spite
of the foulness and the provinciality of Bursley, Sophia enjoyed the
intimacy with Constance. As for Constance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was enchanted. The
inflections of their voices, when they were talking to each other very
privately, were often tender, and these sudden surprising tendernesses
secretly thrilled both of them.

<p/>On the fourth Sunday morning Sophia put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dressing-gown and those
list slippers very early, and paid a visit to Constance's bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was somewhat concerned about Constance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) concern was pleasurable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made the most of it. Amy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lifelong carelessness
about doors, had criminally failed to latch the street-door of the
parlour on the previous morning, and Constance had only perceived the
omission by the phenomenon of frigidity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) legs at breakfast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
always sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) back to the door, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's fluted
rocking-chair; and Sophia on the spot, but not in the chair, occupied
by John Baines in the forties, and in the seventies and later by Samuel
Povey. Constance had been alarmed by that frigidity. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have a
return of my sciatica!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had exclaimed, and Sophia was startled by
the apprehension in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone. Before evening the sciatica had indeed
revisited Constance's sciatic nerve, and Sophia for the first time
gained an idea of what a pulsating sciatica can do in the way of
torturing its victim. Constance, in addition to the sciatica, had
caught a sneezing cold, and the act of sneezing caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the most
acute pain. Sophia had soon stopped the sneezing. Constance was got to
bed. Sophia wished to summon the doctor, but Constance assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that
the doctor would have nothing new to advise. Constance suffered
angelically. The weak and exquisite sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lay
in bed under the stress of twinging pain amid hot-water bottles, was
amazing to Sophia. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) think upon the reserves of Constance's
character, and upon the variety of the manifestations of the Baines'
blood.

<p/>So on the Sunday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had arisen early, just after Amy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) discovered Constance to be a little better, as regards the
neuralgia, but exhausted by the torments of a sleepless night. Sophia,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had herself not slept well, felt somehow conscience-stricken
for having slept at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You poor dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) murmured, brimming with sympathy. <div class="bookquote">``I shall make
you some tea at once, myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Amy will do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>Sophia repeated with a resolute intonation: <div class="bookquote">``I shall make it myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>And after being satisfied that there was no instant need for a renewal
of hot-water bottles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went further downstairs in those list
slippers.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was descending the dark kitchen steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heard Amy's voice in
pettish exclamation: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, get out, YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>followed by a yelp from
Fossette. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a swift movement of anger, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) controlled. The
relations between her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Fossette were not marked by transports, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rule over dogs in general was severe; even when alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) very
seldom kissed the animal passionately, according to the general habit
of people owning dogs. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loved Fossette. And, moreover, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) love
for Fossette had been lately sharpened by the ridicule which Bursley
had showered upon that strange beast. Happily for Sophia's amour
propre, there was no means of getting Fossette shaved in Bursley, and
thus Fossette was daily growing less comic to the Bursley eye. Sophia
could therefore without loss of dignity yield to force of circumstances
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not have yielded to popular opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) guessed that
Amy had no liking for the dog, but the accent which Amy had put upon
the `you' seemed to indicate that Amy was making distinctions between
Fossette and Spot, and this disturbed Sophia much more than Fossette's
yelp.

<p/>Sophia coughed, and entered the kitchen.

<p/>Spot was lapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) morning milk out of a saucer, while Fossette stood
wistfully, an amorphous mass of thick hair, under the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with dreadful politeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, glumly.

<p/>Amy knew that Sophia had heard that yelp, and Sophia knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
knew. The pretence of politeness was horrible. Both the women felt as
though the kitchen was sanded with gunpowder and there were lighted
matches about. Sophia had a very proper grievance against Amy on
account of the open door of the previous day. Sophia thought that,
after such a sin, the least Amy could do was to show contrition and
amiability and an anxiety to please: which things Amy had not shown.
Amy had a grievance against Sophia because Sophia had recently thrust
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a fresh method of cooking green vegetables. Amy was a strong
opponent of new or foreign methods. Sophia was not aware of this
grievance, for Amy had hidden it under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) customary cringing
politeness to Sophia.

<p/>They surveyed each other like opposing armies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity you have no gas-stove here! I want to make some tea at
once for Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, inspecting the just-born fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gas-stove, m'm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, hostilely. It was Sophia's list slippers
which had finally decided Amy to drop the mask of deference.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) made no effort to aid Sophia; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gave no indication as to where
the various necessaries for tea were to be found. Sophia got the
kettle, and washed it out. Sophia got the smallest tea-pot, and, as the
tea-leaves had been left in it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) washed out the teapot also, with
exaggerated noise and meticulousness. Sophia got the sugar and the
other trifles, and Sophia blew up the fire with the bellows. And Amy
did nothing in particular except encourage Spot to drink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all the milk you give to Fossette?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia demanded coldly,
when it had come to Fossette's turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was waiting for the water to
boil. The saucer for the bigger dog, who would have made two of Spot,
was not half full.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all there is to spare, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>Amy rasped.

<p/>Sophia made no reply. Soon afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) departed, with the tea
successfully made. If Amy had not been a mature woman of over forty she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would have snorted as Sophia went away. But Amy was scarcely the
ordinary silly girl.

<p/>Save for a certain primness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) offered the tray to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister,
Sophia's demeanour gave no sign whatever that the Amazon in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
aroused. Constance's eager trembling pleasure in the tea touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
deeply, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was exceedingly thankful that Constance had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
Sophia, as a succour in time of distress.

<p/>A few minutes later, Constance, having first asked Sophia what time it
was by the watch in the watch-case on the chest of drawers -LRB-the Swiss
clock had long since ceased to work-RRB-, pulled the red tassel of the
bell-cord over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bed. A bell tinkled far away in the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything I can do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I only want my letters, if the
postman has come. He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) ought to have been here long ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia had
learned during her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stay that Sunday morning was the morning on which
Constance expected a letter from Cyril. It was a definite arrangement
between mother and son that Cyril should write on Saturdays, and
Constance on Sundays. Sophia knew that Constance set store by this
letter, becoming more and more preoccupied about Cyril as the end of
the week approached. Since Sophia's arrival Cyril's letter had not
failed to come, but once it had been naught save a scribbled line or
two, and Sophia gathered that it was never a certainty, and that
Constance was accustomed, though not reconciled, to disappointments.
Sophia had been allowed to read the letters. They left a faint
impression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) favourite was perhaps somewhat
negligent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mother.

<p/>There was no reply to the bell. Constance rang again without effect.

<p/>With a brusque movement Sophia left the bedroom by way of Cyril's room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) called over the banisters, <div class="bookquote">``do you not hear your mistress's
bell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming as quick as I can, m'm.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The voice was still very glum.

<p/>Sophia murmured something inarticulate, staying till assured that Amy
really was coming, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) passed back into Cyril's bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
waited there, hesitant, not exactly on the watch, not exactly unwilling
to assist at an interview between Amy and Amy's mistress; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
could not have surely analyzed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) motive for remaining in Cyril's
bedroom, with the door ajar between that room and Constance's.

<p/>Amy reluctantly mounted the stairs and went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mistress's bedroom
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) chin in the air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought that Sophia had gone up to the
second storey, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``belonged.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stood in silence by the bed,
showing no sympathy with Constance, no curiosity as to the
indisposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) objected to Constance's attack of sciatica, as being
a too permanent reproof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) carelessness as to doors.

<p/>Constance also waited, for the fraction of a second, as if expectant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said at length in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) voice weakened by fatigue and
pain. <div class="bookquote">``The letters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't no letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, grimly. <div class="bookquote">``You might have known, if
there'd been any, I should have brought 'em up. Postman went past
twenty minutes agone. I'm always being interrupted, and it isn't as if
I hadn't got enough to do--now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) turned to leave, and was pulling the door open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice sharply. It was Sophia's.

<p/>The servant jumped, and in spite of herself obeyed the implicit,
imperious command to stop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will please not speak to your mistress in that tone, at any rate
while I'm here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, icily. <div class="bookquote">``You know she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is ill and weak. You
ought to be ashamed of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never--''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>Amy began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to argue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia said angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Please leave the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy obeyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was cowed, in addition to being staggered.

<p/>To the persons involved in it, this episode was intensely dramatic.
Sophia had surmised that Constance permitted liberties of speech to
Amy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had even guessed that Amy sometimes took licence to be rude.
But that the relations between them were such as to allow the bullying
of Constance by an Amy downright insolent--this had shocked and wounded
Sophia, who suddenly had a vision of Constance as the victim of a reign
of terror. <div class="bookquote">``If the creature will do this while I'm here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia
to herself, <div class="bookquote">``what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) do when they are alone together in the
house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I never heard of such goings-on! And you let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) talk to you in that style! My dear Constance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance was sitting up in bed, the small tea-tray on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knees. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
eyes were moist. The tears had filled them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that there was
no letter. Ordinarily the failure of Cyril's letter would not have made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cry, but weakness had impaired her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) self-control. And the tears
having once got into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not dismiss them. There they
were!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'s been with me such a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) takes
liberties. I've corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) once or twice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Liberties!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia repeated the word. <div class="bookquote">``Liberties!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I really ought not to allow it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to
have put a stop to it long since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, rather relieved by this symptom of Constance's
secret mind, <div class="bookquote">``I do hope you won't think I'm meddlesome, but truly it
was too much for me. The words were out of my mouth before I--''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were quite right, quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, seeing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
in the woman of fifty the passionate girl of fifteen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had a good deal of experience of servants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance put in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm convinced that it never pays to stand any sauce. Servants
don't understand kindness and forbearance. And this sort of thing grows
and grows till you can't call your soul your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance said again, with even more
positiveness.

<p/>Not merely the conviction that Sophia was quite right, but the desire
to assure Sophia that Sophia was not meddlesome, gave force to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
utterance. Amy's allusion to extra work shamed Amy's mistress as a
hostess, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was bound to make amends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now as to that woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia in a lower voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat down
confidentially on the edge of the bed. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) told Constance about Amy
and the dogs, and about Amy's rudeness in the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``I should never
have DREAMT of mentioning such things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) finished. <div class="bookquote">``But under the
circumstances I feel it right that you should know. I feel you ought to
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>And Constance nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head in thorough agreement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not
trouble to go into articulate apologies to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) guest for the actual
misdeeds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) servant. The sisters were now on a plane of intimacy
where such apologies would have been supererogatory. Their voices fell
lower and lower, and the case of Amy was laid bare and discussed to the
minutest detail.

<p/>Gradually they realized that what had occurred was a crisis. They were
both very excited, apprehensive, and rather too consciously defiant. At
the same time they were drawn very close to each other, by Sophia's
generous indignation and by Constance's absolute loyalty.

<p/>A long time passed before Constance said, thinking about something else:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect it's been delayed in the post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cyril's letter? Oh, no doubt! If you knew the posts in France, my
word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they determined, with little sighs, to face the crisis cheerfully.

<p/>In truth it was a crisis, and a great one. The sensation of the crisis
affected the atmosphere of the entire house. Constance got up for tea
and managed to walk to the drawing-room. And when Sophia, after an
absence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own room, came down to tea and found the tea all served,
Constance whispered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s given notice! And Sunday too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't say much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance replied vaguely, hiding from Sophia
that Amy had harped on the too great profusion of mistresses in that
house. <div class="bookquote">``After all, it's just as well. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll be all right. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s saved
a good bit of money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how foolish of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to give up such a good place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) simply doesn't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, who was a little hurt by
Amy's defection. <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes a thing into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) simply
doesn't care. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got no common sense. I've always known that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're going to leave, Amy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia that evening, as Amy was
passing through the parlour on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) way to bed. Constance was already
arranged for the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>answered Amy, precisely.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tone was not rude, but it was firm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had apparently reconnoitred
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) position in calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I was obliged to correct you this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia,
with cheerful amicableness, pleased in spite of herself with the
woman's tone. <div class="bookquote">``But I think you will see that I had reason to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking it over, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, with dignity, <div class="bookquote">``and I see
as I must leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know best... Good night, Amy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, m'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'s a decent woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>thought Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``but hopeless for this place
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>The sisters were fronted with the fact that Constance had a month in
which to find a new servant, and that a new servant would have to be
trained in well-doing and might easily prove disastrous. Both Constance
and Amy were profoundly disturbed by the prospective dissolution of a
bond which dated from the seventies. And both were decided that there
was no alternative to the dissolution. Outsiders knew merely that Mrs.
Povey's old servant was leaving. Outsiders merely saw Mrs. Povey's
advertisement in the Signal for a new servant. They could not read
hearts. Some of the younger generation even said superiorly that
old-fashioned women like Mrs. Povey seemed to have servants on the
brain, etc., etc..

<p/>II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have you got your letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia demanded cheerfully of
Constance when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) entered the bedroom the next morning.

<p/>Constance merely shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was very depressed. Sophia's
cheerfulness died out. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hated to be insincerely optimistic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
said nothing. Otherwise she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have remarked: <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the afternoon
post will bring it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Gloom reigned. To Constance particularly, as Amy
had given notice and as Cyril was <div class="bookquote">``remiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>it seemed really that the
time was out of joint and life unworth living. Even the presence of
Sophia did not bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) much comfort. Immediately Sophia left the room
Constance's sciatica began to return, and in a severe form. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
regretted this, less for the pain than because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had just assured
Sophia, quite honestly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not suffering; Sophia had been
sceptical. After that it was of course imperative that Constance should
get up as usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would get up as usual. Besides,
there was the immense enterprise of obtaining a new servant! Worries
loomed mountainous. Suppose Cyril were dangerously ill, and unable to
write! Suppose something had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)! Supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) never did
obtain a new servant!

<p/>Sophia, up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) room, was endeavouring to be philosophical, and to
see the world brightly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was saying to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must take
Constance in hand, that what Constance lacked was energy, that
Constance must be stirred out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) groove. And in the cavernous
kitchen Amy, preparing the nine-o'clock breakfast, was meditating upon
the ingratitude of employers and wondering what the future held for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had a widowed mother in the picturesque village of Sneyd,
where the mortal and immortal welfare of every inhabitant was watched
over by God's vicegerent, the busy Countess of Chell; she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) possessed
about two hundred pounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) own; her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) mother for years had been
begging Amy to share her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) home free of expense. But nevertheless Amy's
mind was black with foreboding and vague dejection. The house was a
house of sorrow, and these three women, each solitary, the devotees of
sorrow. And the two dogs wandered disconsolate up and down, aware of
the necessity for circumspection, never guessing that the highly
peculiar state of the atmosphere had been brought about by nothing but
a half-shut door and an incorrect tone.

<p/>As Sophia, fully dressed this time, was descending to breakfast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
heard Constance's voice, feebly calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and found the convalescent
still in bed. The truth could not be concealed. Constance was once more
in great pain, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) moral condition was not favourable to fortitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you had told me, to begin with,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia could not help saying,
<div class="bookquote">``then I should have known what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance did not defend herself by saying that the pain had only
recurred since their first interview that morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) just wept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very low!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blubbered.

<p/>Sophia was surprised. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that this was not `being a Baines.''

<p/>During the progress of that interminable April morning, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
acquaintance with the possibilities of sciatica as an agent destructive
of moral fibre was further increased. Constance had no force at all to
resist its activity. The sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) resignation seemed to melt
into nullity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) held to it that the doctor could do nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>About noon, when Sophia was moving anxiously around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) suddenly
screamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel as if my leg was going to burst!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cried.

<p/>That decided Sophia. As soon as Constance was a little easier she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went
downstairs to Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's a Doctor Stirling that your mistress has when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'s ill, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, m'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) surgery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, m'm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) did live just opposite, with Dr. Harrop, but latterly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s gone to live at Bleakridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would put your things on, and run up there and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to
call as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, m'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, with the greatest willingness. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I
heard missis cry out.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not effusive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was better than
effusive: kindly and helpful with a certain reserve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something about that woman I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, to herself.
For a proved fool, Amy was indeed holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own rather well.

<p/>Dr. Stirling drove down about two o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) had now been established
in the Five Towns for more than a decade, and the stamp of success was
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) brow and on the proud forehead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) trotting horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) had, in
the phrase of the Signal, `identified himself with the local life of
the district.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) was liked, being a man of broad sympathies. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>)
rich Scotch accent he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) could discuss with equal ability the flavour of
whisky or of a sermon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) had more than sufficient tact never to
discuss either whiskies or sermons in the wrong place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) had made a
speech -LRB-responding for the learned professions-RRB- at the annual dinner of
the Society for the Prosecution of Felons, and this speech -LRB-in which
praise of red wine was rendered innocuous by praise of books--his (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) fine
library was notorious-RRB- had classed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) as a wit with the American
consul, whose post-prandial manner was modelled on Mark Twain's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was
thirty-five years of age, tall and stoutish, with a chubby boyish face
that the razor left chiefly blue every morning.

<p/>The immediate effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) arrival on Constance was miraculous. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)
presence almost cured her (<font color='blue'><b>Twain</b></font>) for a moment, just as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Twain</b></font>) malady had
been toothache and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) a dentist. Then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)
examination, the pain resumed its sway over her (<font color='blue'><b>Twain</b></font>).

<p/>In talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Twain</b></font>) and to Sophia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) listened very seriously to all that
they said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) seemed to regard the case as the one case that had ever
aroused his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) genuine professional interest; but as it unfolded itself,
in all its difficulty and urgency, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) seemed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) mind, to be
discovering wondrous ways of dealing with it; these mysterious
discoveries seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) confidence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) confidence was
communicated to the patient by means of faint sallies of humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was
a highly skilled doctor. This fact, however, had no share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)
popularity; which was due solely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) rare gift of taking a case very
seriously while remaining cheerful.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) would return in a quarter of an hour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) returned in
thirteen minutes with a hypodermic syringe, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) attacked the
pain in its central strongholds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Constance, breathing gratitude for the relief.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) paused, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) roguishly from under lowered eyelids.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd better not tell ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It might lead ye into mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but you must tell me, doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance insisted, anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
should live up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) reputation for Sophia's benefit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's hydrochloride of cocaine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, and lifted a finger. <div class="bookquote">``Beware
of the cocaine habit. It's ruined many a respectable family. But if I
hadn't had a certain amount of confidence in yer strength of character,
Mrs. Povey, I wouldn't have risked it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) will have his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) joke, will the doctor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance smiled, in a
brighter world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) should come again about half-past five, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) arrived about
half-past six, and injected more cocaine. The special importance of the
case was thereby established. On this second visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) and Sophia soon
grew rather friendly. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) downstairs again he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
stopped chatting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in the parlour for a long time, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
had nothing else on earth to do, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) coachman walked the horse to
and fro in front of the door.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) attitude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flattered Sophia, for it showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
for no ordinary woman. It implied a continual assumption that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must
be a mine of interest for any one who was privileged to delve into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
memory. So far, among Constance's acquaintance, Sophia had met no one
who showed more than a perfunctory curiosity as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) return
was accepted with indifference. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) escapade of thirty years ago had
entirely lost its dramatic quality. Many people indeed had never heard
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had run away from home to marry a commercial traveller; and to
those who remembered, or had been told, it seemed a sufficiently banal
exploit--after thirty years! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fear, and Constance's, that the town
would be murmurous with gossip was ludicrously unfounded. The effect of
time was such that even Mr. Critchlow appeared to have forgotten even
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been indirectly responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father's death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had nearly forgotten it herself; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) happened to think of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
felt no shame, no remorse, seeing the death as purely accidental, and
not altogether unfortunate. On two points only was the town
inquisitive: as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) husband, and as to the precise figure at which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had sold the pension. The town knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was probably not a
widow, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been obliged to tell Mr. Critchlow, and Mr.
Critchlow in some hour of tenderness had told Maria. But nobody had
dared to mention the name of Gerald Scales to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). With her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) fashionable
clothes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) striking mien of command, and the legend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wealth,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) inspired respect, if not awe, in the townsfolk. In the doctor's
attitude there was something of amaze; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) felt it. Though the dull
apathy of the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had hitherto met was assuredly not without its
advantageous side for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tranquillity of mind, it had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
vanity, and the gaze of the doctor soothed the smart. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had so
obviously divined her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) interestingness; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) so obviously wanted to enjoy
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been reading Zola's `Downfall,'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mind searched backwards, and recalled a poster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">''`La Debacle'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. What do ye think of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes lighted at the prospect of a
talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was even pleased to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) the title in French.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was momentarily sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
had not read it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was dashed. The doctor had
supposed that residence in a foreign country involved a knowledge of
the literature of that country. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had never supposed that
residence in England involved a knowledge of English literature. Sophia
had read practically nothing since 1870; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the latest author was
Cherbuliez. Moreover, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) impression of Zola was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zola</b></font>) was not at all
nice, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zola</b></font>) was the enemy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zola</b></font>) race, though at that date the
world had scarcely heard of Dreyfus. Dr. Stirling had too hastily
assumed that the opinions of the bourgeois upon art differ in different
countries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And ye actually were in the siege of Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) questioned, trying
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``AND the commune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the commune too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) exclaimed. ``It's incredible! When I was reading the
<div class="bookquote">``Downfall' the night before last, I said to myself that you must have
been through a lot of all that. I didn't know I was going to have the
pleasure of a chat with ye so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``But how did you know I was in the siege of Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
asked, curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do I know? I know because I've seen that birthday card ye sent to
Mrs. Povey in 1871, after it was over. It's one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) possessions,
that card is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) showed it me one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) told me ye were coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia started. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had quite forgotten that card. It had not occurred
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that Constance would have treasured all those cards that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
despatched during the early years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) responded as well
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) eagerness for personal details concerning the siege
and the commune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) might have been disappointed at the prose of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
answers, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) not been determined not to be disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye seem to have taken it all very quietly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) agreed, not without pride. <div class="bookquote">``But it's a long time since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Those events, as they existed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) memory, scarcely warranted the
tremendous fuss subsequently made about them. What were they, after
all? Such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) secret thought. Chirac himself was now nothing but a
faint shadow. Still, were the estimate of those events true or false,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a woman who had been through them, and Dr. Stirling's high
appreciation of that fact was very pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Their friendliness
approached intimacy. Night had fallen. Outside could be heard the
champing of a bit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be getting on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) said at last; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) did not move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there is nothing else I am to do for my sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It isn't a question of medicine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what is it a question of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia demanded bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nerves,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's nearly all nerves. I know something about Mrs.
Povey's constitution now, and I was hoping that your visit would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)'s been quite well--I mean what you may call quite well--until the
day before yesterday, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) sat in that draught. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was better last
night, and then this morning I find her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) ever so much worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No worries?''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>The doctor looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) confidentially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What CAN she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) have in the way of worries?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``That's to
say--real worries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) doesn't know what worry is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes twinkling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was a little upset because she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) didn't receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) usual Sunday
letter from Cyril yesterday. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was weak and low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clever youth, Cyril!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>mused the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)'s a particularly nice boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, eagerly,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, rather stiffly. Did the doctor suppose that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own nephew? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went back to the subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
sister. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) is also a little bothered, I think, because the servant is
going to leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! So Amy is going to leave, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) spoke still lower. <div class="bookquote">``Between
you and me, it's no bad thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad you think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In another few years the servant would have been the mistress here.
One can see these things coming on, but it's so difficult to do
anything. In fact ye can't do anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``I told the woman straight
that it shouldn't go on while I was in the house. I didn't suspect it
at first--but when I found it out ... I can tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) let the
doctor imagine what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can easily understand that ye didn't
suspect anything at first. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s well and bright Mrs. Povey could

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then people talk about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, shocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As a native of Bursley, Mrs. Scales,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">``ye ought to

not you. But you know all about that, Mrs. Scales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said abruptly, sticking out his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be down
in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever mention this to my sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), rising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But it's no use. Oh yes, I've told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) does
really think it's quite impossible. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wouldn't even hear of going to
live in London with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) beloved son. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) won't listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their hand-grasp was very intimate and mutually comprehending. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was
pleased by the quick responsiveness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) temperament, and the
masterful vigour which occasionally flashed out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) replies. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
noticed the hardly perceptible distortion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) handsome, worn face,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said to himself: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s been through a thing or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and:
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'ll have to mind her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) p's and q's.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sophia was pleased because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and because with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) bedside jocularities,
and talked plainly as a sensible man will talk when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) meets an
uncommonly wise woman, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) echoed and amplified her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) by standing at the door till he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had driven
off.

<p/>For a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mused solitary in the parlour, and then, lowering
the gas, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister, who lay in the dark. Sophia
struck a match.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been having quite a long chat with the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s very good company, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) talk about this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wanted to know about Paris and so on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s a rare student.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Lying there in the dark, the simple Constance never suspected that
those two active and strenuous ones had been arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should be jolly and live for twenty years yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did
not suspect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been tried and found guilty of sinful
attachments, and of being in a rut, and of lacking the elements of
ordinary sagacity. It had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was worried
and ill, the reason was to be found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own blind and stupid
obstinacy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had thought herself a fairly sensible kind of creature.

<p/>III

<p/>The sisters had an early supper together in Constance's bedroom.
Constance was much easier. Having a fancy that a little movement would
be beneficial, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had even got up for a few moments and moved about
the room. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat ensconced in pillows. A fire burned in the
old-fashioned ineffectual grate. From the Sun Vaults opposite came the
sound of a phonograph singing an invitation to God to save its gracious
queen. This phonograph was a wonderful novelty, and filled the Sun
nightly. For a few evenings it had interested the sisters, in spite of
themselves, but they had soon sickened of it and loathed it. Sophia
became more and more obsessed by the monstrous absurdity of the simple
fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Constance were there, in that dark inconvenient
house, wearied by the gaiety of public-houses, blackened by smoke,
surrounded by mud, instead of being luxuriously installed in a
beautiful climate, amid scenes of beauty and white cleanliness.
Secretly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) became more and more indignant.

<p/>Amy entered, bearing a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) coarse hand. As Amy
unceremoniously handed the letter to Constance, Sophia thought: <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
was my servant she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would hand letters on a tray.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>-LRB-An advertisement had
already been sent to the Signal.-RRB-

<p/>Constance took the letter trembling. <div class="bookquote">``Here it is at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cried.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spectacles and read it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us! Here's news! He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)'s coming down! That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) didn't write on
Saturday as usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gave the letter to Sophia to read. It ran--

<p/>``Sunday midnight.

<p/>``DEAR MOTHER,

<p/>``Just a line to say I am coming down to Bursley on Wednesday, on
business with Peels. I shall get to Knype at 5.28, and take the Loop.
I've been very busy, and as I was coming down I didn't write on
Saturday. I hope you didn't worry. Love to yourself and Aunt Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours, C.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must send him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a line,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, excitedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? To-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Amy can easily catch the last post with it. Otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) won't
know that I've got his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rang the bell.

<p/>Sophia thought: <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) coming down is really no excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) not
writing on Saturday. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) guess that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was coming down? I
shall have to put in a little word to that young man. I wonder
Constance is so blind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is quite satisfied now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) letter has
come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>On behalf of the elder generation she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rather resented
Constance's eagerness to write in answer.

<p/>But Constance was not so blind. Constance thought exactly as Sophia
thought. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not at all justify or excuse Cyril. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
remembered separately almost every instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) carelessness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
regard. <div class="bookquote">``Hope I didn't worry, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to herself with a faint
touch of bitterness, apropos of the phrase in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) letter.

<p/>Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) insisted on writing at once. And Amy had to bring the
writing materials.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cyril is coming down on Wednesday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said to Amy with great
dignity.

<p/>Amy's stony calmness was shaken, for Mr. Cyril was a great deal to Amy.
Amy wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would be able to look Mr. Cyril in the face when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had given notice.

<p/>In the middle of writing, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knee, Constance looked up at Sophia,
and said, as though defending herself against an accusation: <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) yesterday, you know, or to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia murmured assentingly.

<p/>Constance rang the bell yet again, and Amy was sent out to the post.

<p/>Soon afterwards the bell was rung for a fourth time, and not answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hasn't come back yet. But I thought I heard the door.
What a long time she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I just want to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>When the bell had been rung seven or eight times, Amy at length
re-appeared, somewhat breathless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, <div class="bookquote">``let me examine those sheets, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Bates</b></font>)</div>said Amy, apparently knowing what sheets, of all the various
and multitudinous sheets in that house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the pillow-cases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance added as Amy left the room.

<p/>So it continued. The next day the fever heightened. Constance was up
early, before Sophia, and trotting about the house like a girl.
Immediately after breakfast Cyril's bedroom was invested and
revolutionized; not till evening was order restored in that chamber.
And on the Wednesday morning it had to be dusted afresh. Sophia watched
the preparations, and the increasing agitation of Constance's
demeanour, with an astonishment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had real difficulty in
concealing. <div class="bookquote">``Is the woman absolutely mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked herself. The
spectacle was ludicrous: or it seemed so to Sophia, whose career had
not embraced much experience of mothers. It was not as if the
manifestations of Constance's anxiety were dignified or original or
splendid. They were just silly, ordinary fussinesses; they had no sense
in them. Sophia was very careful to make no observation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and Constance were very much older she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a very great deal
to do, and that a subtle diplomacy and wary tactics would be necessary.
Moreover, Constance's angelic temper was slightly affected by the
strain of expectation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a tendency to rasp. After the high-tea
was set she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) suddenly sprang on to the sofa and lifted down the ``Stag at
Eve' engraving. The dust on the top of the frame incensed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked, in a final marvel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to change it with that one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, pointing to
another engraving opposite the fireplace. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said the effect would be
very much better if they were changed. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lordship is very
particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance did not go to Bursley station to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) explained
that it upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to do so, and that also Cyril preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) not to
come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I go to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, at half-past five. The idea
had visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) suddenly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``Then I could talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) before
any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance agreed.

<p/>Sophia put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) things on with remarkable expedition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arrived at the
station a minute before the train came in. Only a few persons emerged
from the train, and Cyril was not among them. A porter said that there
was not supposed to be any connection between the Loop Line trains and
the main line expresses, and that probably the express had missed the
Loop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) waited thirty-five minutes for the next Loop, and Cyril did
not emerge from that train either.

<p/>Constance opened the front-door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and showed a telegram--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry prevented last moment. Writing. CYRIL.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia had known it. Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had known that it was useless to wait
for the second train. Constance was silent and calm; Sophia also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a shame! What a shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>thumped Sophia's heart.

<p/>It was the most ordinary episode. But beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) calm she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was furious
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) favourite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just going out a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we better have tea? I suppose we must
have tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't be long. I want to buy something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia went to the post-office and despatched a telegram. Then,
partially eased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) returned to the arid and painful desolation of the
house.

<p/>IV

<p/>The next evening Cyril sat at the tea-table in the parlour with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) aunt. To Constance his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) presence there had something of
the miraculous in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had come, after all! Sophia was in a rich
robe, and for ornament wore an old silver-gilt neck-chain, which was
clasped at the throat, and fell in double to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) waist, where it was
caught in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) belt. This chain interested Cyril. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) referred to it once
or twice, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Just let me have a LOOK at that chain,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hand; and Sophia leaned forward so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could handle
it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) fingers played with it thus for some seconds; the picture
strikingly affected Constance. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) dropped it, and said:
<div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After a pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Louis Sixteenth, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Sophia said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They told me so. But it's nothing; it only cost thirty francs, you
know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>And Cyril took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) up sharply:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Then after another pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``How often
do you break a link of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, often,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's always getting shorter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) murmured mysteriously: <div class="bookquote">``H'm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was still mysterious, withdrawn within himself extraordinarily
uninterested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) physical surroundings. But that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) talked
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) usually did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was benevolent, and showed a particular
benevolence towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother, apparently exerting himself to answer
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) questions with fullness and heartiness, as though admitting frankly
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) right to be curious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) praised the tea; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) seemed to notice what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was eating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) took Spot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) knee, and gazed in admiration at
Fossette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's a dog, that is! ... All the same...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) burst out laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have Fossette laughed at,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) quality of an amateur of dogs; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) is
very fine.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Even then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) could not help adding: <div class="bookquote">``What you can see of
her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon Sophia shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head, deprecating such wit. Sophia was very
lenient towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) leniency could be perceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes, which
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) movements all the time. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is like me,
Constance?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was half as good-looking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril, quickly; and Constance
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As a baby he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was very like you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was a handsome baby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) wasn't at
all like you when he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was at school. These last few years he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)'s begun to
be like you again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)'s very much changed since he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) left school; he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was
rather heavy and clumsy then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heavy and clumsy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I should never have
believed it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance insisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mater,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>said Cyril, <div class="bookquote">``it's a pity you don't want that cake cutting
into. I think I could have eaten a bit of that cake. But of course if
it's only for show...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance sprang up, seizing a knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't tease your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia told him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) doesn't really
want any, Constance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)'s regularly stuffed himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>And Cyril agreed, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, mater, don't cut it; I really couldn't. I
was only gassing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div><p/>But Constance could never clearly see through humour of that sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
cut three slices of cake, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) held the plate towards Cyril.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you I really couldn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said obstinately. <div class="bookquote">``I'm waiting! How much longer must I hold
this plate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had to take a slice. So had Sophia. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was roused, they
both of them had to yield to Constance.

<p/>With the dogs, and the splendour of the tea-table under the gas, and
the distinction of Sophia and Cyril, and the conversation, which on the
whole was gay and free, rising at times to jolly garrulity, the scene
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) parlour ought surely to have satisfied Constance utterly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
ought to have been quite happy, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sciatica had raised the siege
for a space. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not quite happy. The circumstances of Cyril's
arrival had disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); they had in fact wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would scarcely admit the wound. In the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had received a brief
letter from Cyril to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had not been able to come, and vaguely
promising, or half-promising, to run down at a later date. That letter
had the cardinal defects of all Cyril's relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother; it
was casual, and it was not candid. It gave no hint of the nature of the
obstacle which had prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) from coming. Cyril had always been too
secretive. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gravely depressed by the letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not
show to Sophia, because it impaired her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dignity as a mother, and
displayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) son in a bad light. Then about eleven o'clock a telegram
had come for Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia had said, on reading it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)'ll be here this
evening!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had handed over the telegram, which read--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Will come same train to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And Constance learned that when Sophia had rushed out just before tea
on the previous evening, it was to telegraph to Cyril.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with a careless air, <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ought
to come. After all, you're more important than any business, Constance!
And I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) behaving like that. I was determined he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) should
come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia had tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) proud head.

<p/>Constance had pretended to be pleased and grateful. But the existence
of a wound was incontestable. Sophia, then, could do more with Cyril
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could! Sophia had only met him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) once, and could simply twist
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) little finger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would never have done so much for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
mother. A fine sort of an obstacle it must have been, if a single
telegram from Sophia could overcome it...! And Sophia, too, was
secretive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had gone out and had telegraphed, and had not breathed a
word until she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) got the reply, sixteen hours later. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was secretive,
and Cyril was secretive. They resembled one another. They had taken to
one another. But Sophia was a curious mixture. When Constance had asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should go to the station again to meet Cyril, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
replied scornfully: <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! I've done going to meet Cyril. People
who don't arrive must not expect to be met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When Cyril drove up to the door, Sophia had been in attendance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
hurried down the steps. <div class="bookquote">``Don't say anything about my telegram,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
rapidly whispered to Cyril; there was no time for further explanation.
Constance was at the top of the steps. Constance had not heard the
whisper, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had seen it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw a guilty, puzzled look on
Cyril's face, afterwards an ineffectively concealed conspiratorial look
on both their faces. They had `something between them,'' from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
the mother, was shut out! Was it not natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should be
wounded? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was far too proud to mention the telegrams. And as neither
Cyril nor Sophia mentioned them, the circumstances leading to Cyril's
change of plan were not referred to at all, which was very curious.
Then Cyril was more sociable than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had ever been; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was different,
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) aunt's gaze. Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother faultlessly. But
Constance said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``It is because she (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) is here that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) is so
specially nice to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When tea was finished and they were going upstairs to the drawing-room,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eye on the ``Stag at Eve' engraving:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, is it a success?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) eye followed hers. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you've changed it! What did you do
that for, mater?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said it would be better like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) seemed genuinely surprised. <div class="bookquote">``I don't remember. I believe it
is better, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``It might be even better still if you
turned it the other way up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pulled a face to Sophia, and screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) shoulders, as if to
indicate: <div class="bookquote">``I've done it, this time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How? The other way up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance queried. Then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) comprehended
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was teasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Get away with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and pretended
to box his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``You were fond enough of that picture at one time!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said ironically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was, mater,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) submissively agreed. <div class="bookquote">``There's no getting over
that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cheeks between his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) hands and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>In the drawing-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) smoked cigarettes and played the piano--waltzes
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) own composition. Constance and Sophia did not entirely
comprehend those waltzes. But they agreed that all were wonderful and
that one was very pretty indeed. -LRB-It soothed Constance that Sophia's
opinion coincided with hers.-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said that that waltz was the worst of
the lot. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had finished with the piano, Constance informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
about Amy. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) brought me my water. I
didn't mention it because I thought it would be rather a sore subject.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Beneath the casualness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) tone there lurked a certain curiosity, a
willingness to hear details. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) heard them.

<p/>At five minutes to ten, when Constance had yawned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) threw a bomb
among them on the hearthrug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've got an appointment with Matthew at the
Conservative Club at ten o'clock. I must go. Don't wait up for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Both women protested, Sophia the more vivaciously. It was Sophia now
who was wounded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, defending himself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s going away early
to-morrow, and it's my only chance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>And as Constance did not brighten
he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``Business has to be attended to. You mustn't think I've got
nothing to do but enjoy myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No hint of the nature of the business! He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) never explained. As to
business, Constance knew only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) three hundred a
year, and paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) local tailor. The sum had at first seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
enormous, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had grown accustomed to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have preferred you to see Mr. Peel-Swynnerton here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said
Constance. <div class="bookquote">``You could have had a room to yourselves. I do not like you
going out at ten o'clock at night to a club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, good night, mater,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, getting up. <div class="bookquote">``See you to-morrow. I
shall take the key out of the door. It's true my pocket will never be
the same again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia saw Constance into bed, and provided her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with two hot-water
bottles against sciatica. They did not talk much.

<p/>V

<p/>Sophia sat waiting on the sofa in the parlour. It appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that,
though little more than a month had elapsed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) arrival in
Bursley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had already acquired a new set of interests and anxieties.
Paris and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life there had receded in the strangest way. Sometimes
for hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would absolutely forget Paris. Thoughts of Paris were
disconcerting; for either Paris or Bursley must surely be unreal! As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat waiting on the sofa Paris kept coming into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind. Certainly
it was astonishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should be just as preoccupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
schemes for the welfare of Constance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had ever been preoccupied
with schemes for the improvement of the Pension Frensham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said to
herself: <div class="bookquote">``My life has been so queer--and yet every part of it
separately seemed ordinary enough--how will it end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there were footfalls on the steps outside, and a key was put into
the door, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at once opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Cyril, startled, and also somewhat out of countenance.
<div class="bookquote">``You're still up! Thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) came in, smoking the end of a cigar.
<div class="bookquote">``Fancy having to cart that about!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) murmured, holding up the great
old-fashioned key before inserting it in the lock on the inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stayed up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``because I wanted to talk to you about your
mother, and it's so difficult to get a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril smiled, not without self-consciousness, and dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
mother's rocking-chair, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had twisted round with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) feet to
face the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I was wondering what was the real meaning of your
telegram. What was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) blew out a lot of smoke and waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you ought to come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, cheerfully but firmly.
<div class="bookquote">``It was a fearful disappointment to your mother that you didn't come
yesterday. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s expecting a letter from you and it doesn't
come, it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad it's no worse. I thought from your
telegram there was something seriously wrong. And then when you told me
not to mention it--when I came in...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) failed to realize the situation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
head challengingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You neglect your mother, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come now, auntie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) answered quite gently. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't talk
like that. I write to her (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) every week. I've never missed a week. I come
down as often as--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You miss the Sunday sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">``But what--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) simply lives for your letters? And if
one doesn't come, she (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>)'s very upset indeed--can't eat! And it brings on
her (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) sciatica, and I don't know what!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was taken aback by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) boldness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) directness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how silly of her (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>)! A fellow can't always--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be silly. But there it is. You can't alter her (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>). And, after all,
what would it cost you to be more attentive, even to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) twice
a week? You aren't going to tell me you're so busy as all that! I know
a great deal more about young men than your mother does.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled
like an aunt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smile sheepishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll only put yourself in your mother's place...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect you're quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said at length. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm much obliged
to you for telling me. How was I to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) threw the end of the
cigar, with a large sweeping gesture, into the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, anyhow, you know now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said curtly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``You
OUGHT to have known. It was your business to know.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was pleased
with the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) criticism, and the gesture
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) threw away the cigar-end struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as very distinguished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said dreamily, as if to say: <div class="bookquote">``That's done with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) rose.

<p/>Sophia, however, did not stir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother's health is not what it ought to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went on, and
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) a full account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) conversation with the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril murmured, leaning on the mantel-piece with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) elbow
and looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Stirling said that, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>)? I should have
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have been better where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is, in the Square.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why better in the Square?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither do I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s always been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s been here a great deal too long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do YOU suggest?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril asked, with impatience in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) voice
against this new anxiety that was being thrust upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``what should you say to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coming to London and
living with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cyril started back. Sophia could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) was genuinely shocked. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't think that would do at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't think it would. London wouldn't suit her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not that
sort of woman. I really thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was quite all right down here. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wouldn't like London.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) head, looking up at the gas; his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
eyes had a dangerous glare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Cyril began in a new and brighter tone. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you and
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) keep house together somewhere? That would be the very--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) head sharply. There was a noise on the staircase, and the
staircase door opened with its eternal creak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``The Champs Elysees begins at the Place de la
Concorde, and ends--. Is that you, Constance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>The figure of Constance filled the doorway. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face was troubled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had heard Cyril in the street, and had come down to see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) remained
so long in the parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was astounded to find Sophia with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>).
There they were, as intimate as cronies, chattering about Paris!
Undoubtedly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was jealous! Never did Cyril talk like that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were in bed and asleep, Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said weakly. <div class="bookquote">``It's
nearly one o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't seem to feel like going to bed; and then
Cyril happened to come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nor Cyril could look innocent. And Constance glanced
from one to the other apprehensively.

<p/>The next morning Cyril received a letter which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said--with no
further explanation--forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to leave at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) intimated that
there had been danger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) coming just then, and that matters had
turned out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had feared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think over what I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) whispered to Sophia when they were
alone for an instant, <div class="bookquote">``and let me know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div><p/>VI

<p/>A week before Easter the guests of the Rutland Hotel in the Broad Walk,
Buxton, being assembled for afternoon tea in the <div class="bookquote">``lounge''  (<font color='red'><b>Buxton</b></font>)</div>of that
establishment, witnessed the arrival of two middle-aged ladies and two
dogs. Critically to examine newcomers was one of the amusements of the
occupants of the lounge. This apartment, furnished <div class="bookquote">``in the oriental
style,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>made a pretty show among the photographs in the illustrated
brochure of the hotel, and, though draughty, it was of all the public
rooms the favourite. It was draughty because only separated from the
street -LRB-if the Broad Walk can be called a street-RRB- by two pairs of
swinging-doors--in charge of two page-boys. Every visitor entering the
hotel was obliged to pass through the lounge, and for newcomers the
passage was an ordeal; they were made to feel that they had so much to
learn, so much to get accustomed to; like passengers who join a ship at
a port of call, they felt that the business lay before them of creating
a niche for themselves in a hostile and haughty society. The two ladies
produced a fairly favourable impression at the outset by reason of
their two dogs. It is not every one who has the courage to bring dogs
into an expensive private hotel; to bring one dog indicates that you
are not accustomed to deny yourself small pleasures for the sake of a
few extra shillings; to bring two indicates that you have no fear of
hotel-managers and that you are in the habit of regarding your own whim
as nature's law. The shorter and stouter of the two ladies did not
impose herself with much force on the collective vision of the Rutland;
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was dressed in black, not fashionably, though with a certain
unpretending richness; her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gestures were timid and nervous; evidently
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) relied upon her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tall companion to shield her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in the first trying
contacts of hotel life. The tall lady was of a different stamp.
Handsome, stately, deliberate, and handsomely dressed in colours, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had the assured hard gaze of a person who is thoroughly habituated to
the inspection of strangers. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) curtly asked one of the page-boys for
the manager, and the manager's wife tripped rapidly down the stairs in
response, and was noticeably deferential--Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) voice was quiet and
commanding, the voice of one who gives orders that are obeyed. The
opinion of the lounge was divided as to whether or not they were
sisters.

<p/>They vanished quietly upstairs in convoy of the manager's wife, and
they did not re-appear for the lounge tea, which in any case would have
been undrinkably stewed. It then became known, by the agency of one of
those guests, to be found in every hotel, who acquire all the secrets
of the hotel by the exercise of unabashed curiosity on the personnel,
that the two ladies had engaged two bedrooms, Nos. 17 and 18, and the
sumptuous private parlour with a balcony on the first floor, styled <div class="bookquote">``C''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>in the nomenclature of rooms. This fact definitely established the
position of the new arrivals in the moral fabric of the hotel. They
were wealthy. They had money to throw away. For even in a select hotel
like the Rutland it is not everybody who indulges in a private
sitting-room; there were only four such apartments in the hotel, as
against fifty bedrooms.

<p/>At dinner they had a small table to themselves in a corner. The short
lady wore a white shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulders. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) almost apologetic
manner during the meal confirmed the view that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be a very
simple person, unused to the world and its ways. The other continued to
be imperial. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ordered half-a-bottle of wine and drank two glasses.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stared about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) quite self-unconsciously, whereas the little woman
divided her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glances between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) plate. They did not
talk much. Immediately after dinner they retired. <div class="bookquote">``Widows in easy
circumstances''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>was the verdict; but the contrast between the pair held
puzzles that piqued the inquisitive.

<p/>Sophia had conquered again. Once more Sophia had resolved to accomplish
a thing and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had accomplished it. Events had fallen out thus. The
advertisement for a general servant in the Signal had been a
disheartening failure. A few answers were received, but of an entirely
unsatisfactory character. Constance, a great deal more than Sophia, had
been astounded by the bearing and the demands of modern servants.
Constance was in despair. If Constance had not had an immense pride she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would have been ready to suggest to Sophia that Amy should be asked to
`stay on.'' But Constance would have accepted a modern impudent wench
first. It was Maria Critchlow who got Constance out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) difficulty
by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) particulars of a reliable servant who was about to leave
a situation in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had stayed for eight years. Constance did not
imagine that a servant recommended by Maria Critchlow would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>),
but, being in a quandary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) arranged to see the servant, and both she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
and Sophia were very pleased with the girl--Rose Bennion by name. The
mischief was that Rose would not be free until about a month after Amy
had left. Rose would have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) old situation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had a fancy
to go and spend a fortnight with a married sister at Manchester before
settling into new quarters. Constance and Sophia felt that this caprice
of Rose's was really very tiresome and unnecessary. Of course Amy might
have been asked to `stay on' just for a month. Amy would probably have
volunteered to do so had she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) been aware of the circumstances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
not, however, aware of the circumstances. And Constance was determined
not to be beholden to Amy for anything. What could the sisters do?
Sophia, who conducted all the interviews with Rose and other
candidates, said that it would be a grave error to let Rose slip.
Besides, they had no one to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) place, no one who could come at
once.

<p/>The dilemma was appalling. At least, it seemed appalling to Constance,
who really believed that no mistress had ever been so `awkwardly
fixed.'' And yet, when Sophia first proposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) solution, Constance
considered it to be a quite impossible solution. Sophia's idea was that
they should lock up the house and leave it on the same day as Amy left
it, to spend a few weeks in some holiday resort. To begin with, the
idea of leaving the house empty seemed to Constance a mad idea. The
house had never been left empty. And then--going for a holiday in
April! Constance had never been for a holiday except in the month of
August. No! The project was beset with difficulties and dangers which
could not be overcome nor provided against. For example, ``We can't come
back to a dirty house,'' said Constance. ``And we can't have a strange
servant coming here before us.'' To which Sophia had replied: <div class="bookquote">``Then what
SHALL you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And Constance, after prodigious reflection on the
frightful pass to which destiny had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would have to manage with a charwoman until Rose's advent.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked Sophia if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered old Maggie. Sophia, of course,
perfectly remembered. Old Maggie was dead, as well as the drunken,
amiable Hollins, but there was a young Maggie -LRB-wife of a bricklayer-RRB-
who went out charing in the spare time left from looking after seven
children. The more Constance meditated upon young Maggie, the more was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) convinced that young Maggie would meet the case. Constance felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could trust young Maggie.

<p/>This expression of trust in Maggie was Constance's undoing. Why should
they not go away, and arrange with Maggie to come to the house a few
days before their return, to clean and ventilate? The weight of reason
overbore Constance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yielded unwillingly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yielded. It was
the mention of Buxton that finally moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew Buxton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old
landlady at Buxton was dead, and Constance had not visited the place
since before Samuel's death; nevertheless its name had a reassuring
sound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ears, and for sciatica its waters and climate were
admitted to be the best in England. Gradually Constance permitted
herself to be embarked on this perilous enterprise of shutting up the
house for twenty-five days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imparted the information to Amy, who
was astounded. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) commenced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) domestic preparations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
wrapped Samuel's Family Bible in brown paper; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put Cyril's
straw-framed copy of Sir Edwin Landseer away in a drawer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took
ten thousand other precautions. It was grotesque; it was farcical; it
was what you please. And when, with the cab at the door and the luggage
on the cab, and the dogs chained together, and Maria Critchlow waiting
on the pavement to receive the key, Constance put the key into the door
on the outside, and locked up the empty house, Constance's face was
tragic with innumerable apprehensions. And Sophia felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
performed a miracle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had.

<p/>On the whole the sisters were well received in the hotel, though they
were not at an age which commands popularity. In the criticism which
was passed upon them--the free, realistic and relentless criticism of
private hotels--Sophia was at first set down as overbearing. But in a
few days this view was modified, and Sophia rose in esteem. The fact
was that Sophia's behaviour changed after forty-eight hours. The
Rutland Hotel was very good. It was so good as to disturb Sophia's
profound beliefs that there was in the world only one truly high-class
pension, and that nobody could teach the creator of that unique pension
anything about the art of management. The food was excellent; the
attendance in the bedrooms was excellent -LRB-and Sophia knew how difficult
of attainment was excellent bedroom attendance-RRB-; and to the eye the
interior of the Rutland presented a spectacle far richer than the
Pension Frensham could show. The standard of comfort was higher. The
guests had a more distinguished appearance. It is true that the prices
were much higher. Sophia was humbled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had enough sense to adjust
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) perspective. Further, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found herself ignorant of many matters
which by the other guests were taken for granted and used as a basis
for conversation. Prolonged residence in Paris would not justify this
ignorance; it seemed rather to intensify its strangeness. Thus, when
someone of cosmopolitan experience, having learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had lived in
Paris for many years, asked what had been going on lately at the
Comedie Francaise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not been in a French
theatre for nearly thirty years. And when, on a Sunday, the same person
questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) about the English chaplain in Paris, lo! she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew
nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) name, had never even seen him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>). Sophia's life, in its
way, had been as narrow as Constance's. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) experience of human
nature was wide, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been in a groove as deep as Constance's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
had been utterly absorbed in doing one single thing.

<p/>By tacit agreement she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had charge of the expedition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paid all the
bills. Constance protested against the expensiveness of the affair
several times, but Sophia quietened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) by sheer force of
individuality. Constance had one advantage over Sophia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew Buxton
and its neighbourhood intimately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was therefore in a position
to show off the sights and to deal with local peculiarities. In all
other respects Sophia led.

<p/>They very soon became acclimatized to the hotel. They moved easily
between Turkey carpets and sculptured ceilings; their eyes grew used to
the eternal vision of themselves and other slow-moving dignities in
gilt mirrors, to the heaviness of great oil-paintings of picturesque
scenery, to the indications of surreptitious dirt behind massive
furniture, to the grey-brown of the shirt-fronts of the waiters, to the
litter of trays, boots and pails in long corridors; their ears were
always awake to the sounds of gongs and bells. They consulted the
barometer and ordered the daily carriage with the perfunctoriness of
habit. They discovered what can be learnt of other people's needlework
in a hotel on a wet day. They performed co-operative outings with
fellow-guests. They invited fellow-guests into their sitting-room. When
there was an entertainment they did not avoid it. Sophia was determined
to do everything that could with propriety be done, partly as an outlet
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own energy -LRB-which since she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) left Paris had been accumulating-RRB-,
but more on Constance's account. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remembered all that Dr. Stirling
had said, and the heartiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own agreement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) opinions. It
was a great day when, under tuition of an aged lady and in the privacy
of their parlour, they both began to study the elements of Patience.
Neither had ever played at cards. Constance was almost afraid to touch
cards, as though in the very cardboard there had been something
unrighteous and perilous. But the respectability of a luxurious private
hotel makes proper every act that passes within its walls. And
Constance plausibly argued that no harm could come from a game which
you played by yourself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) acquired with some aptitude several
varieties of Patience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I think I could enjoy that, if I kept
at it. But it does make my head whirl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless Constance was not happy in the hotel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) worried the
whole time about her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) empty house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) anticipated difficulties and even
disasters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) wondered again and again whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) could trust the
second Maggie in her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) house alone, whether it would not be better to
return home earlier and participate personally in the cleaning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>)
would have decided to do so had it not been that she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) hesitated to
subject Sophia to the inconvenience of a house upside down. The matter
was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind, always. Always she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was restlessly anticipating the day
when they would leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had carelessly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart behind in St.
Luke's Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never stayed in a hotel before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not
like it. Sciatica occasionally harassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Yet when it came to the
point she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not drink the waters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) never had drunk
them, and seemed to regard that as a reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) never should.
Sophia had achieved a miracle in getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to Buxton for nearly a
month, but the ultimate grand effect lacked brilliance.

<p/>Then came the fatal letter, the desolating letter, which vindicated
Constance's dark apprehensions. Rose Bennion calmly wrote to say that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had decided not to come to St. Luke's Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) expressed regret
for any inconvenience which might possibly be caused; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was polite.
But the monstrousness of it! Constance felt that this actually and
truly was the deepest depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) calamities. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, far from
a dirty home, with no servant and no prospect of a servant! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bore
herself bravely, nobly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was stricken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wanted to return to
the dirty home at once.

<p/>Sophia felt that the situation created by this letter would demand her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
highest powers of dealing with situations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) determined to deal
with it adequately. Great measures were needed, for Constance's health
and happiness were at stake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) alone could act. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could not rely upon Cyril. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) still had an immense partiality for
Cyril; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) the most charming young man she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had ever known;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) to be industrious and clever; but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) relations with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother there was a hardness, a touch of callousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) explained
it vaguely by saying that `they did not get on well together'; which
was strange, considering Constance's sweet affectionateness. Still,
Constance could be a little trying--at times. Anyhow, it was soon clear
to Sophia that the idea of mother and son living together in London was
entirely impracticable. No! If Constance was to be saved from herself,
there was no one but Sophia to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>After half a morning spent chiefly in listening to Constance's hopeless
comments on the monstrous letter, Sophia said suddenly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must
take the dogs for an airing. Constance did not feel equal to walking
out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not drive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not want Sophia to <div class="bookquote">``venture,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>because the sky threatened. However, Sophia did venture, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
returned a few minutes late for lunch, full of vigour, with two happy
dogs. Constance was moodily awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) in the dining-room. Constance
could not eat. But Sophia ate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) poured out cheerfulness and
energy as from a source inexhaustible. After lunch it began to rain.
Constance said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should retire directly to the
sitting-room. <div class="bookquote">``I'm coming too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, who was still wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
hat and coat and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gloves in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand. In the pretentious and
banal sitting-room they sat down on either side the fire. Constance put
a little shawl round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shoulders, pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spectacles into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grey
hair, folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hands, and sighed an enormous sigh: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was the tragic muse, aged, and in black silk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what I've been thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, folding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
gloves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>asked Constance, expecting some wonderful solution to come out
of Sophia's active brain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no earthly reason why you should go back to Bursley. The house
won't run away, and it's costing nothing but the rent. Why not take
things easy for a bit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And stay here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, with an inflection that enlightened
Sophia as to the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dislike of the existence at the
Rutland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia answered with quick deprecation. <div class="bookquote">``There are
plenty of other places we could go to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I should be easy in my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``What with
nothing being settled, the house--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter about the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It matters a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, seriously, and slightly
hurt. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't leave things as if we were going to be away for a long
time. It wouldn't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that anything could come to any harm, I really don't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, persuasively. <div class="bookquote">``Dirt can always be cleaned, after all. I
think you ought to go about more. It would do you good--all the good in
the world. And there is no reason why you shouldn't go about. You are
perfectly free. Why shouldn't we go abroad together, for instance, you
and I? I'm sure you would enjoy it very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Abroad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>murmured Constance, aghast, recoiling from the proposition as
from a grave danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, brightly and eagerly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was determined to take
Constance abroad. <div class="bookquote">``There are lots of places we could go to, and live
very comfortably among nice English people.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought of the resorts
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had visited with Gerald in the sixties. They seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) like
cities of a dream. They came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) as a dream recurs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think going abroad would suit me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not? You don't know. You've never tried, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) smiled
encouragingly. But Constance did not smile. Constance was inclined to
be grim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), obstinately. <div class="bookquote">``I'm one of your
stay-at-homes. I'm not like you. We can't all be alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) added,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) `tart' accent.

<p/>Sophia suppressed a feeling of irritation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a
stronger individuality than Constance's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, with undiminished persuasiveness, <div class="bookquote">``in England
or Scotland. There are several places I should like to visit--Torquay,
Tunbridge Wells. I've always under-stood that Tunbridge Wells is a very
nice town indeed, with very superior people, and a beautiful climate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall have to be getting back to St. Luke's Square,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said
Constance, ignoring all that Sophia had said. <div class="bookquote">``There's so much to be
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Sophia looked at Constance with a more serious and resolute air;
but still kindly, as though looking thus at Constance for Constance's
own good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are making a mistake, Constance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you will allow me
to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A mistake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Constance, startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very great mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia insisted, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
creating an effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how I can be making a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance said, gaining
confidence in herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought the matter over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you don't see it. But you are. You know,
you are just a little apt to let yourself be a slave to that house of
yours. Instead of the house existing for you, you exist for the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance muttered awkwardly. <div class="bookquote">``What ideas you do have, to
be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nervousness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rose and picked up some embroidery,
adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) spectacles and coughing. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat down she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``No
one could take things easier than I do as regards housekeeping. I can
assure you I let dozens of little matters go, rather than bother
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you bother now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia posed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't leave the place like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance was hurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one thing I can't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head
and gazing at Constance again, <div class="bookquote">``and that is, why you live in St. Luke's
Square at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must live somewhere. And I'm sure it's very pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In all that smoke! And with that dirt! And the house is very old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great deal better built than a lot of those new houses by the
Park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance sharply retorted. In spite of herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) resented any
criticism of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) even resented the obvious truth that it was
old.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll never get a servant to stay in that cellar-kitchen, for one
thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, keeping calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't know about that! I don't know about that! That Bennion
woman didn't object to it, anyway. It's all very well for you, Sophia,
to talk like that. But I know Bursley perhaps better than you do.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was tart again. <div class="bookquote">``And I can assure you that my house is looked upon as a
very good house indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't say it isn't; I don't say it isn't. But you would be
better away from it. Every one says that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance looked up, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``Who? Who's been
talking about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``the doctor, for instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Stirling? I like that! He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>)'s always saying that Bursley is one of
the healthiest climates in England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>)'s always sticking up for
Bursley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Stirling thinks you ought to go away more--not stay always in that
dark house.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>If Sophia had sufficiently reflected she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not have
used the adjective <div class="bookquote">``dark.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It did not help her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance fairly snorted. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if it's of any interest
to Dr. Stirling, I like my dark house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) ever told you you ought to go away more?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia persisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) may have mentioned it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance reluctantly admitted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) was talking to me he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) did a good deal more than mention it. And
I've a good mind to tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, politely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't realize how serious it is, I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``You
can't see yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hesitated a moment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) blood being stirred by
Constance's peculiar inflection of the phrase `my dark house,'' her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
judgment was slightly obscured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) decided to give Constance a fairly
full version of the conversation between herself and the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a question of your health,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) finished. <div class="bookquote">``I think it's my duty
to talk to you seriously, and I have done. I hope you'll take it as
it's meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance hastened to say. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``It isn't
yet three months that we've been together, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s trying already to
get me under her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A pause ensued. Sophia at length said: <div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt that both your
sciatica and your palpitations are due to nerves. And you let your
nerves get into a state because you worry over trifles. A change would
do you a tremendous amount of good. It's just what you need. Really,
you must admit, Constance, that the idea of living always in a place
like St. Luke's Square, when you are perfectly free to do what you like
and go where you like--you must admit it's rather too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips together and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) embroidery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what do you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia gently entreated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some of us like Bursley, black as it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. And
Sophia was surprised to detect tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear Constance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) remonstrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Constance, flinging away her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) work, and letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
tears flow suddenly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face was distorted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was behaving just like
a child. <div class="bookquote">``It's no use! I've got to go back home and look after things.
It's no use. Here we are pitching money about in this place. It's
perfectly sinful. Drives, carriages, extras! A shilling a day extra for
each dog. I never heard of such goings-on. And I'd sooner be at home.
That's it. I'd sooner be at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>This was the first reference that
Constance had made for a long time to the question of expense, and
incomparably the most violent. It angered Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will count it that you are here as my guest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, loftily,
<div class="bookquote">``if that is how you look at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't the money I grudge. Oh no, we
won't.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tears were falling thick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I've only been talking to you for
your own good. I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) despairingly, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you wouldn't
try to domineer over me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Domineer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sophia, aghast. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Constance, I do think--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) got up and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bedroom, where the dogs were imprisoned.
They escaped to the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was shaking with emotion. This was what
came of trying to help other people! Imagine Constance...! Truly
Constance was most unjust, and quite unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) usual self! And Sophia
encouraged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) breast the feeling of injustice suffered. But a voice
kept saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``You've made a mess of this. You've not conquered
this time. You're beaten. And the situation is unworthy of you, of both
of you. Two women of fifty quarreling like this! It's undignified.
You've made a mess of things.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And to strangle the voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
best to encourage the feeling of injustice suffered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Domineer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>And Constance was absolutely in the wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not argued at all.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had merely stuck to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) idea like a mule! How difficult and painful
would be the next meeting with Constance, after this grievous
miscarriage!

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was reflecting thus the door burst open, and Constance stumbled,
as it were blindly, into the bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was still weeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sobbed, supplicatingly, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) fat body was
trembling. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't kill me ... I'm like that--you can't alter me.
I'm like that. I know I'm silly. But it's no use!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made a piteous
figure.

<p/>Sophia was aware of a lump in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, Constance; it's all right. I quite understand. Don't
bother any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) breath at intervals, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wet, worn face
and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>Sophia remembered the very words, <div class="bookquote">``You can't alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
used in remonstrating with Cyril. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been guilty of
precisely the same unreason as that with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had reproached
Cyril! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was ashamed, both for herself and for Constance. Assuredly
it had not been such a scene as women of their age would want to go
through often. It was humiliating. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wished that it could have been
blotted out as though it had never happened. Neither of them ever
forgot it. They had had a lesson. And particularly Sophia had had a
lesson. Having learnt, they left the Rutland, amid due ceremonies, and
returned to St. Luke's Square.




<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>END OF SOPHIA

<p/>I


<p/>The kitchen steps were as steep, dark, and difficult as ever. Up those
steps Sophia Scales, nine years older than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had failed to
persuade Constance to leave the Square, was carrying a large basket,
weighted with all the heaviness of Fossette. Sophia, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) age,
climbed the steps violently, and burst with equal violence into the
parlour, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) deposited the basket on the floor near the empty
fireplace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was triumphant and breathless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked at Constance,
who had been standing near the door in the attitude of a shocked
listener.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) talked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``What shall you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I had a very good mind to order her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) out of the
house at once. But then I thought I would take no notice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) time will
be up in three weeks. It's best to be indifferent. If once they see
they can upset you... However, I wasn't going to leave Fossette down there
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tender mercies a moment longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)'s simply not looked after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knees to the basket, and, pulling aside the dog's
hair, round about the head, examined the skin. Fossette was a sick dog
and behaved like one. Fossette, too, was nine years older, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
senility was offensive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was to no sense a pleasant object.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/>Constance also knelt to the basket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``And here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The dog sighed, the insincere and pity-seeking sigh of a spoilt animal.
Fossette foolishly hoped by such appeals to be spared the annoying
treatment prescribed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) by the veterinary surgeon.

<p/>While the sisters were coddling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and protecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own
paws, and trying to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that all was for the best, another
aged dog wandered vaguely into the room: Spot. Spot had very few teeth,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) legs were stiff. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had only one vice, jealousy. Fearing that
Fossette might be receiving the entire attention of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) mistresses, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
had come to inquire into the situation. When he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) found the justification
of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) gloomiest apprehensions, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) nosed obstinately up to Constance,
and would not be put off. In vain Constance told him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) at length that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
was interfering with the treatment. In vain Sophia ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) sharply
to go away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would not listen to reason, being furious with jealousy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) foot into the basket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sophia angrily, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) a clout on his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) old
head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) barked snappishly, and retired to the kitchen again,
disillusioned, tired of the world, and nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) terrific grievance.
<div class="bookquote">``I do declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``that dog gets worse and worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance said nothing.

<p/>When everything was done that could be done for the aged virgin in the
basket, the sisters rose from their knees, stiffly; and they began to
whisper to each other about the prospects of obtaining a fresh servant.
They also debated whether they could tolerate the criminal
eccentricities of the present occupant of the cave for yet another
three weeks. Evidently they were in the midst of a crisis. To judge
from Constance's face every imaginable woe had been piled on them by
destiny without the slightest regard for their powers of resistance.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes had the permanent look of worry, and there was in them also
something of the self-defensive. Sophia had a bellicose air, as though
the creature in the cave had squarely challenged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
decided to take up the challenge. Sophia's tone seemed to imply an
accusation of Constance. The general tension was acute.

<p/>Then suddenly their whispers expired, and the door opened and the
servant came in to lay the supper. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nose was high, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze cruel,
radiant, and conquering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was a pretty and an impudent girl of about
twenty-three. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was torturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) old and infirm mistresses.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did it purposely. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) motto was: War on
employers, get all you can out of them, for they will get all they can
out of you. On principle--the sole principle she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) possessed--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
not stay in a place more than six months. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) liked change. And
employers did not like change. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was shameless with men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ignored
all orders as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was to eat and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not to eat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
lived up to the full resources of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) employers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could be to the
last degree slatternly. Or she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could be as neat as a pin, with an apron
that symbolized purity and propriety, as to-night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could be idle
during a whole day, accumulating dirty dishes from morn till eve. On
the other hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chose, work with astonishing
celerity and even thoroughness. In short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was born to infuriate a
mistress like Sophia and to wear out a mistress like Constance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
strongest advantage in the struggle was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) enjoyed altercation;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) revelled in a brawl; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found peace tedious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was perfectly
calculated to convince the sisters that times had worsened, and that
the world would never again be the beautiful, agreeable place it once
had been.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gestures as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) laid the table were very graceful, in the pert
style. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dropped forks into their appointed positions with disdain;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) made slightly too much noise; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) manoeuvred her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
swelling hips as though for the benefit of a soldier in a handsome
uniform.

<p/>Nothing but the servant had been changed in that house. The harmonium
on which Mr. Povey used occasionally to play was still behind the door;
and on the harmonium was the tea-caddy of which Mrs. Baines used to
carry the key on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) bunch. In the corner to the right of the fireplace
still hung the cupboard where Mrs. Baines stored her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) pharmacopoeia. The
rest of the furniture was arranged as it had been arranged when the
death of Mrs. Baines endowed Mr. and Mrs. Povey with all the treasures
of the house at Axe. And it was as good as ever; better than ever. Dr.
Stirling often expressed the desire for a corner cupboard like Mrs.
Baines's corner cupboard. One item had been added: the ``Peel' compote
which Matthew Peel-Swynnerton had noticed in the dining-room of the
Pension Frensham. This majestic piece, which had been reserved by
Sophia in the sale of the pension, stood alone on a canterbury in the
drawingroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had stored it, with a few other trifles, in Paris, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sent for it and the packing-case arrived, both she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and
Constance became aware that they were united for the rest of their
lives. Of worldly goods, except money, securities, and clothes, that
compote was practically all that Sophia owned. Happily it was a
first-class item, doing no shame to the antique magnificence of the
drawing-room.

<p/>In yielding to Constance's terrible inertia, Sophia had meant
nevertheless to work her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own will on the interior of the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
meant to bully Constance into modernizing the dwelling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did bully
Constance, but the house defied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Nothing could be done to that
house. If only it had had a hall or lobby a complete transformation
would have been possible. But there was no access to the upper floor
except through the parlour. The parlour could not therefore be turned
into a kitchen and the basement suppressed, and the ladies of the house
could not live entirely on the upper floor. The disposition of the
rooms had to remain exactly as it had always been. There was the same
draught under the door, the same darkness on the kitchen stairs, the
same difficulties with tradesmen in the distant backyard, the same
twist in the bedroom stairs, the same eternal ascending and descending
of pails. An efficient cooking-stove, instead of the large and
capacious range, alone represented the twentieth century in the
fixtures of the house.

<p/>Buried at the root of the relations between the sisters was Sophia's
grudge against Constance for refusing to leave the Square. Sophia was
loyal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not consciously give with one hand while taking away
with the other, and in accepting Constance's decision she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) honestly
meant to close her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes to its stupidity. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not entirely
succeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not avoid thinking that the angelic Constance had
been strangely and monstrously selfish in refusing to quit the Square.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) marvelled that a woman of Constance's sweet and calm disposition
should be capable of so vast and ruthless an egotism. Constance must
have known that Sophia would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and that the habitation of
the Square was a continual irk to Sophia. Constance had never been able
to advance a single argument for remaining in the Square. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
would not budge. It was so inconsistent with the rest of Constance's
behaviour. See Sophia sitting primly there by the table, a woman
approaching sixty, with immense experience written on the fine hardness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) worn and distinguished face! Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hair is not yet all
grey, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) figure bowed, you would imagine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
passage through the world, have learnt better than to expect a
character to be consistent. But no! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was ever disappointed and hurt
by Constance's inconsistency! And see Constance, stout and bowed,
looking more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) age with hair nearly white and slightly trembling
hands! See that face whose mark is meekness and the spirit of
conciliation, the desire for peace--you would not think that that
placid soul could, while submitting to it, inly rage against the
imposed weight of Sophia's individuality. <div class="bookquote">``Because I wouldn't turn out
of my house to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance would say to herself, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
fancies she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) is entitled to do just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) likes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Not often did she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
secretly rebel thus, but it occurred sometimes. They never quarrelled.
They would have regarded separation as a disaster. Considering the
difference of their lives, they agreed marvellously in their judgment
of things. But that buried question of domicile prevented a complete
unity between, them. And its subtle effect was to influence both of
them to make the worst, instead of the best, of the trifling mishaps
that disturbed their tranquillity. When annoyed, Sophia would meditate
upon the mere fact that they lived in the Square for no reason
whatever, until it grew incredibly shocking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). After all it was
scarcely conceivable that they should be living in the very middle of a
dirty, ugly, industrial town simply because Constance mulishly declined
to move. Another thing that curiously exasperated both of them upon
occasion was that, owing to a recurrence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) old complaint of
dizziness after meals, Sophia had been strictly forbidden to drink tea,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loved. Sophia chafed under the deprivation, and Constance's
pleasure was impaired because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had to drink it alone.

<p/>While the brazen and pretty servant, mysteriously smiling to herself,
dropped food and utensils on to the table, Constance and Sophia
attempted to converse with negligent ease upon indifferent topics, as
though nothing had occurred that day to mar the beauty of ideal
relations between employers and employed. The pretence was ludicrous.
The young wench saw through it instantly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mysterious smile
developed almost into a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please shut the door after you, Maud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, as the girl picked
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) empty tray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maud</b></font>)</div>replied Maud, politely.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went out and left the door open.

<p/>It was a defiance, offered from sheer, youthful, wanton mischief.

<p/>The sisters looked at each other, their faces gravely troubled, aghast,
as though they had glimpsed the end of civilized society, as though
they felt that they had lived too long into an age of decadence and
open shame. Constance's face showed despair--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) might have been about
to be pitched into the gutter without a friend and without a
shilling--but Sophia's had the reckless courage that disaster breeds.

<p/>Sophia jumped up, and stepped to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Maud,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) called out.

<p/>No answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maud, do you hear me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The suspense was fearful.

<p/>Still no answer.

<p/>Sophia glanced at Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Either she (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) shuts this door, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) leaves
this house at once, even if I have to fetch a policeman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>And Sophia disappeared down the kitchen steps. Constance trembled with
painful excitement. The horror of existence closed in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
could imagine nothing more appalling than the pass to which they had
been brought by the modern change in the lower classes.

<p/>In the kitchen, Sophia, conscious that the moment held the future of at
least the next three weeks, collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) forces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maud,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``did you not hear me call you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maud looked up from a book--doubtless a wicked book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>thought Sophia. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I asked you to shut the
parlour door, and I shall be obliged if you will do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Maud would have given a week's wages for the moral force to disobey
Sophia. There was nothing to compel her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to obey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could have
trampled on the fragile and weak Sophia. But something in Sophia's gaze
compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to obey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flounced; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bridled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mumbled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
unnecessarily disturbed the venerable Spot; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) obeyed. Sophia had
risked all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had won something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you should light the gas in the kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia
magnificently, as Maud followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) up the steps. <div class="bookquote">``Your young eyes may
be very good now, but you are not going the way to preserve them. My
sister and I have often told you that we do not grudge you gas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With stateliness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rejoined Constance, and sat down to the cold
supper. And as Maud clicked the door to, the sisters breathed relief.
They envisaged new tribulations, but for a brief instant there was
surcease.

<p/>Yet they could not eat. Neither of them, when it came to the point,
could swallow. The day had been too exciting, too distressing. They
were at the end of their resources. And they did not hide from each
other that they were at the end of their resources. The illness of
Fossette, without anything else, had been more than enough to ruin
their tranquillity. But the illness of Fossette was as nothing to the
ingenious naughtiness of the servant. Maud had a sense of temporary
defeat, and was planning fresh operations; but really it was Maud who
had conquered. Poor old things, they were in such a `state' that they
could not eat!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) think she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can spoil my appetite!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said
Sophia, dauntless. Truly that woman's spirit was unquenchable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cut a couple of slices off the cold fowl; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cut a tomato into
slices; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) disturbed the butter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) crumbled bread on the cloth, and
rubbed bits of fowl over the plates, and dirtied knives and forks. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) put the slices of fowl and bread and tomato into a piece of tissue
paper, and silently went upstairs with the parcel and came down again a
moment afterwards empty-handed.

<p/>After an interval she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rang the bell, and lighted the gas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've finished, Maud. You can clear away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance thirsted for a cup of tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that a cup of tea was the
one thing that would certainly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) alive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) longed for it
passionately. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not demand it from Maud. Nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>)
mention it to Sophia, lest Sophia, flushed by the victory of the door,
should incur new risks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) simply did without. On empty stomachs they
tried pathetically to help each other in games of Patience. And when
the blithe Maud passed through the parlour on the way to bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) saw
two dignified and apparently calm ladies, apparently absorbed in a
delightful game of cards, apparently without a worry in the world. They
said <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Maud,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cheerfully, politely, and coldly. It was a
heroic scene. Immediately afterwards Sophia carried Fossette up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
own bedroom.

<p/>II

<p/>The next afternoon the sisters, in the drawing-room, saw Dr. Stirling's
motor-car speeding down the Square. The doctor's partner, young Harrop,
had died a few years before at the age of over seventy, and the
practice was much larger than it had ever been, even in the time of old
Harrop. Instead of two or three horses, Stirling kept a car, which was
a constant spectacle in the streets of the district.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll call in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel/Mrs. Povey/Daniel Povey</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Povey, and sighed.

<p/>Sophia smiled to herself with a little scorn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that Constance's
desire for Dr. Stirling was due simply to the need which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt of
telling some one about the great calamity that had happened to them
that morning. Constance was utterly absorbed by it, in the most
provincial way. Sophia had said to herself at the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
sojourn in Bursley, and long afterwards, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should never get
accustomed to the exasperating provinciality of the town, exemplified
by the childish preoccupation of the inhabitants with their own
two-penny affairs. No characteristic of life in Bursley annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
more than this. None had oftener caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to yearn in a brief madness
for the desert-like freedom of great cities. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had got accustomed
to it. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had almost ceased to notice it. Only occasionally,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nerves were more upset than usual, did it strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went into Constance's bedroom to see whether the doctor's car
halted in King Street. It did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) called out to Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd go down, Sophia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I can't trust that
minx--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>So Sophia went downstairs to superintend the opening of the door by the
minx.

<p/>The doctor was radiant, according to custom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I'd just see how that dizziness was going on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
came up the steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, confidentially. Since the first
days of their acquaintanceship they had always been confidential.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll do my sister good to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maud</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as Maud was closing the door a telegraph-boy arrived, with a
telegram addressed to Mrs. Scales. Sophia read it and then crumpled it
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong with Mrs. Povey to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor asked, when the
servant had withdrawn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) only wants a bit of your society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``Will you go up?
You know the way to the drawing-room. I'll follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat down on the sofa, staring out of the
window. Then with a grunt: <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's no use, anyway!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) went
upstairs after the doctor. Already Constance had begun upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance was saying. <div class="bookquote">``And when I went down this morning to keep
an eye on the breakfast, I thought Spot was very quiet--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) paused.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was dead in the drawer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) pretended she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) didn't know, but I'm sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) did. Nothing will convince me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) didn't poison that dog with
the mice-poison we had last year. She (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was vexed because Sophia took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
up sharply about Fossette last night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) revenged herself on the
other dog. It would just be like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Don't tell me! I know. I should
have packed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) off at once, but Sophia thought better not. We couldn't
prove anything, as Sophia says. Now, what do you think of it, doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance's eyes suddenly filled with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye'd had Spot a long time, hadn't ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said sympathetically.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``When I was married,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the first thing my husband
did was to buy a fox-terrier, and ever since we've always had a
fox-terrier in the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This was not true, but Constance was firmly
convinced of its truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very trying,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I know when my Airedale died, I
said to my wife I'd never have another dog--unless she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could find me
one that would live for ever. Ye remember my Airedale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, quite well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my wife said I should be bound to have another one sooner or
later, and the sooner the better. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went straight off to Oldcastle
and bought me a spaniel pup, and there was such a to-do training it
that we hadn't too much time to think about Piper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance regarded this procedure as somewhat callous, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said so,
tartly. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recommenced the tale of Spot's death from the
beginning, and took it as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) burial, that afternoon, by Mr.
Critchlow's manager, in the yard. It had been necessary to remove and
replace paving-stones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Stirling/Stirling</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Stirling, <div class="bookquote">``ten years is a long time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) was an
old dog. Well, you've still got the celebrated Fossette.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Stirling/Stirling</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) turned to
Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, perfunctorily. <div class="bookquote">``Fossette's ill. The fact is
that if Fossette hadn't been ill, Spot would probably have been alive
and well now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) tone exhibited a grievance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not forget that Sophia had
harshly dismissed Spot to the kitchen, thus practically sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) death. It seemed very hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that Fossette, whose life had
once been despaired of, should continue to exist, while Spot, always
healthy and unspoilt, should die untended, and by treachery. For the
rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never liked Fossette. On Spot's behalf she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had always
been jealous of Fossette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably alive and well now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) repeated, with a peculiar accent.

<p/>Observing that Sophia maintained a strange silence, Dr. Stirling
suspected a slight tension in the relations of the sisters, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>)
changed the subject. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) great qualities was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) refrained
from changing a subject introduced by a patient unless there was a
professional reason for changing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just met Richard Povey in the town,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) told me to tell
ye that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'ll be round in about an hour or so to take you for a spin.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was in a new car, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) best to sell to me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) didn't
succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very kind of Dick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``But this afternoon really
we're not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll thank ye to take it as a prescription, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor.
<div class="bookquote">``I told Dick I'd see that ye went. Splendid June weather. No dust after
all that rain. It'll do ye all the good in the world. I must exercise
my authority. The truth is, I've gradually been losing all control over
ye. Ye do just as ye like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, doctor, how you do run on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>murmured Constance, not quite well
pleased to-day by his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) tone.

<p/>After the scene between Sophia and herself at Buxton, Constance had
always, to a certain extent, in the doctor's own phrase, `got her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knife
into him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>).'' Sophia had, then, in a manner betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). Constance and
the doctor discussed that matter with frankness, the doctor humorously
accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) of being `hard' on him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Nevertheless the little cloud
between them was real, and the result was often a faint captiousness on
Constance's part in judging the doctor's behaviour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s got a surprise for ye, has Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor added.

<p/>Dick Povey, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) father's death and his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) own partial recovery, had
set up in Hanbridge as a bicycle agent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was permanently lamed, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hopped about with a thick stick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had succeeded with bicycles and
had taken to automobiles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was succeeding with automobiles.
People were at first startled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) should advertise himself in the
Five Towns. There was an obscure general feeling that because his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
mother had been a drunkard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) father a murderer, Dick Povey had no
right to exist. However, when it had recovered from the shock of seeing
Dick Povey's announcement of bargains in the Signal, the district most
sensibly decided that there was no reason why Dick Povey should not
sell bicycles as well as a man with normal parents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was now supposed
to be acquiring wealth rapidly. It was said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was a marvellous
chauffeur, at once daring and prudent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had one day, several years
previously, overtaken the sisters in the rural neighbourhood of Sneyd,
where they had been making an afternoon excursion. Constance had
presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to Sophia, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had insisted on driving the ladies
home. They had been much impressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) cautious care of them, and
their natural prejudice against anything so new as a motorcar had been
conquered instantly. Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had taken them out for occasional
runs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had a great admiration for Constance, founded on gratitude to
Samuel Povey; and as for Sophia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) always said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would
be an ornament to any car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) latest, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked perfunctorily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wants to take to ballooning. It seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'s been up once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance made a deprecating noise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, that's not his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) surprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor added, smiling again at
the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was sitting on the music-stool, and saying to himself,
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mask of effulgent good-nature: <div class="bookquote">``It gets more and more uphill
work, cheering up these two women. I'll try them on Federation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Federation was the name given to the scheme for blending the Five Towns
into one town, which would be the twelfth largest town in the kingdom.
It aroused fury in Bursley, which saw in the suggestion nothing but the
extinction of its ancient glory to the aggrandizement of Hanbridge.
Hanbridge had already, with the assistance of electric cars that
whizzed to and fro every five minutes, robbed Bursley of two-thirds of
its retail trade--as witness the steady decadence of the Square!--and
Bursley had no mind to swallow the insult and become a mere ward of
Hanbridge. Bursley would die fighting. Both Constance and Sophia were
bitter opponents of Federation. They would have been capable of putting
Federationists to the torture. Sophia in particular, though so long
absent from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) native town, had adopted its cause with characteristic
vigour. And when Dr. Stirling wished to practise his (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) curative treatment
of taking the sisters `out of themselves,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) had only to start the
hare of Federation and the hunt would be up in a moment. But this
afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) did not succeed with Sophia, and only partially with
Constance. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) stated that there was to be a public meeting that
very night, and that Constance as a ratepayer ought to go to it and
vote, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) convictions were genuine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) received his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) chaff with a
mere murmur to the effect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should go. Had the
man forgotten that Spot was dead? At length he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became grave, and
examined them both as to their ailments, and nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and
looked into vacancy while meditating upon each case. And then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had inquired where they meant to go for their summer holidays, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
departed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance whispered to Sophia, who
had shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) at the drawingroom door. It was Sophia who
did the running about, owing to the state of Constance's sciatic nerve.
Constance had, indeed, become extraordinarily inert, leaving everything
to Sophia.

<p/>Sophia shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hesitated; then approached Constance,
holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand and disclosing the crumpled telegram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face frightened Constance, who was always expectant of new
anxieties and troubles. Constance straightened out the paper with
difficulty, and read--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gerald Scales is dangerously ill here. Boldero, 49, Deansgate,
Manchester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>All through the inexpressibly tedious and quite unnecessary call of Dr.
Stirling---LRB-Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Stirling</b></font>) chosen to call just then? Neither of them was
ill-RRB---Sophia had held that telegram concealed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand and its
information concealed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) head up, offering
a calm front to the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had given no hint of the terrible
explosion--for an explosion it was. Constance was astounded at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
sister's self-control, which entirely passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) comprehension.
Constance felt that worries would never cease, but would rather go on
multiplying until death ended all. First, there had been the frightful
worry of the servant; then the extremely distressing death and burial
of Spot--and now it was Gerald Scales turning up again! With what
violence was the direction of their thoughts now shifted! The
wickedness of maids was a trifle; the death of pets was a trifle. But
the reappearance of Gerald Scales! That involved the possibility of
consequences which could not even be named, so afflictive was the mere
prospect to them. Constance was speechless, and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) saw that Sophia was
also speechless.

<p/>Of course the event had been bound to happen. People do not vanish
never to be heard of again. The time surely arrives when the secret is
revealed. So Sophia said to herself--now!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had always refused to consider the effect of Gerald's reappearance.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had put the idea of it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), determined to convince
herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) finally and for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). It was years since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had ceased to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
thoughts--many years. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) MUST be dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had persuaded herself. <div class="bookquote">``It
is inconceivable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) should have lived on and never come across me.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) had been alive and learnt that I had made money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) would
assuredly have come to me. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) must be dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was not dead! The brief telegram overwhelmingly shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
life had been calm, regular, monotonous. And now it was thrown into an
indescribable turmoil by five words of a telegram, suddenly, with no
warning whatever. Sophia had the right to say to herself: <div class="bookquote">``I have had
my share of trouble, and more than my share!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>The end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life
promised to be as awful as the beginning. The mere existence of Gerald
Scales was a menace to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But it was the simple impact of the blow
that affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) supremely, beyond ulterior things. One might have
pictured fate as a cowardly brute who had struck this ageing woman full
in the face, a felling blow, which however had not felled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
staggered, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stuck on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legs. It seemed a shame--one of those
crude, spectacular shames which make the blood boil--that the gallant,
defenceless creature should be so maltreated by the bully, destiny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sophia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance moaned. <div class="bookquote">``What trouble is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia's lip curled with a disgusted air. Under that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
suffering.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) for thirty-six years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) must be over seventy
years of age, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had turned up again like a bad penny, doubtless a
disgrace! What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) been doing in those thirty-six years? He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was an
old, enfeebled man now! He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) must be a pretty sight! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) lay at
Manchester, not two hours away!

<p/>Whatever feelings were in Sophia's heart, tenderness was not among
them. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wits from the stroke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was principally
aware of the sentiment of fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) recoiled from the future.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance asked. Constance was weeping.

<p/>Sophia tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) foot, glancing out of the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I must!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hated the thought of going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) flinched from it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
felt herself under no moral obligation to go. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) go? Gerald
was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and had no claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) of any kind. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
honestly believed. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew
it to be impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should not go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>demanded Constance.

<p/>Sophia nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about the trains? ... Oh, you poor dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>The mere idea of the
journey to Manchester put Constance out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wits, seeming a business
of unparalleled complexity and difficulty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like me to come with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! I must go by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance was relieved by this. They could not have left the servant in
the house alone, and the idea of shutting up the house without notice
or preparation presented itself to Constance as too fantastic.

<p/>By a common instinct they both descended to the parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what about a time-table? What about a time-table?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance
mumbled on the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes resolutely. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder
whatever in this world has brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) at last to that Mr. Boldero's in
Deansgate?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked the walls.

<p/>As they came into the parlour, a great motor-car drove up before the
door, and when the pulsations of its engine had died away, Dick Povey
hobbled from the driver's seat to the pavement. In an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was
hammering at the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lively style. There was no avoiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).
The door had to be opened. Sophia opened it. Dick Povey was over forty,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) looked considerably younger. Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lameness, and the fact
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) lameness tended to induce corpulence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had a dashing air,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) face, with its short, light moustache, was boyish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) seemed to
be always upon some joyous adventure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, aunties,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) greeted the sisters, having perceived Constance
behind Sophia; he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) often so addressed them. <div class="bookquote">``Has Dr. Stirling warned you
that I was coming? Why haven't you got your things on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia observed a young woman in the car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), following her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gaze, <div class="bookquote">``you may as well look. Come down,
miss. Come down, Lily. You've got to go through with it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The young
woman, delicately confused and blushing, obeyed. <div class="bookquote">``This is Miss Lily
Holl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether you would remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). I
don't think you do. It's not often she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) comes to the Square. But, of
course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) knows you by sight. Granddaughter of your old neighbour,
Alderman Holl! We are engaged to be married, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance and Sophia could not decently pour out their griefs on the
top of such news. The betrothed pair had to come in and be
congratulated upon their entry into the large realms of mutual love.
But the sisters, even in their painful quandary, could not help
noticing what a nice, quiet, ladylike girl Lily Holl was. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) one fault
appeared to be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) was too quiet. Dick Povey was not the man to
pass time in formalities, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was soon urging departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry we can't come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I've got to go to Manchester
now. We are in great trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in great trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance weakly echoed.

<p/>Dick's face clouded sympathetically. And both the affianced began to
see that to which the egotism of their happiness had blinded them. They
felt that long, long years had elapsed since these ageing ladies had
experienced the delights which they were feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble? I'm sorry to hear that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me the trains to Manchester?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick, quickly, <div class="bookquote">``But I can drive you there quicker than any
train, if it's urgent. Where do you want to go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Deansgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick, <div class="bookquote">``it's half-past three. Put yourself in my
hands; I'll guarantee at Deansgate you shall be before half-past five.
I'll look after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``There isn't any ``but.<div class="bookquote">'' I'm quite free for the afternoon and evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>At first the suggestion seemed absurd, especially to Constance. But
really it was too tempting to be declined. While Sophia made ready for
the journey, Dick and Lily Holl and Constance conversed in low, solemn
tones. The pair were waiting to be enlightened as to the nature of the
trouble; Constance, however, did not enlighten them. How could
Constance say to them: <div class="bookquote">``Sophia has a husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hasn't seen for
thirty-six years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s dangerously ill, and they've telegraphed for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance could not. It did not even occur to Constance to
order a cup of tea.

<p/>III

<p/>Dick Povey kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) word. At a quarter-past five he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) drew up in front of
No. 49, Deansgate, Manchester. <div class="bookquote">``There you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said, not without
pride. <div class="bookquote">``Now, we'll come back in about a couple of hours or so, just to
take your orders, whatever they are.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was very comforting, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
suggestion that in him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) Sophia had a sure support in the background.

<p/>Without many words Sophia went straight into the shop. It looked like a
jeweller's shop, and a shop for bargains generally. Only the
conventional sign over a side-entrance showed that at heart it was a
pawnbroker's. Mr. Till Boldero did a nice business in the Five Towns,
and in other centres near Manchester, by selling silver-ware
second-hand, or nominally second hand, to persons who wished to make
presents to other persons or to themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) would send anything by
post on approval. Occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) came to the Five Towns, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) had
once, several years before, met Constance. They had talked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was the
son of a cousin of the late great and wealthy Boldero, sleeping partner
in Birkinshaws, and Gerald's uncle. It was from Constance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had
learnt of Sophia's return to Bursley. Constance had often remarked to
Sophia what a superior man Mr. Till Boldero was.

<p/>The shop was narrow and lofty. It seemed like a menagerie for trapped
silver-ware. In glass cases right up to the dark ceiling silver vessels
and instruments of all kinds lay confined. The top of the counter was a
glass prison containing dozens of gold watches, together with
snuff-boxes, enamels, and other antiquities. The front of the counter
was also glazed, showing vases and large pieces of porcelain. A few
pictures in heavy gold frames were perched about. There was a case of
umbrellas with elaborate handles and rich tassels. There were a couple
of statuettes. The counter, on the customers' side, ended in a glass
screen on which were the words <div class="bookquote">``Private Office.''  (<font color='red'><b>the customers</b></font>)</div>On the seller's side
the prospect was closed by a vast safe. A tall young man was fumbling
in this safe. Two women sat on customers' chairs, leaning against the
crystal counter. The young man came towards them from the safe, bearing
a tray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much is that goblet?''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>asked one of the women, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) parasol
dangerously among such fragility and pointing to one object among many
in a case high up from the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-five pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man disposed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tray on the counter. It was packed with more
gold watches, adding to the extraordinary glitter and shimmer of the
shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose a small watch from the regiment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, this is something I can recommend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's made by
Cuthbert Butler of Blackburn. I can guarantee you that for five years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were the accredited representative of the Bank of
England, with calm and absolute assurance.

<p/>The effect upon Sophia was mysteriously soothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
among honest men. The young man raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with a
questioning, deferential gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I see Mr. Boldero?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Scales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man's face changed instantly to a sympathetic comprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madam. I'll fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappeared
behind the safe. The two customers discussed the watch. Then the door
opened in the glass screen, and a portly, middle-aged man showed
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed in blue broad-cloth, with a turned-down collar
and a small black tie. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waistcoat displayed a plain but heavy gold
watch-chain, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cuff-links were of plain gold. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye-glasses
were gold-rimmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had grey hair, beard and moustache, but on the
backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands grew a light brown hair. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance was
strangely mild, dignified, and confidence-inspiring. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, in fact,
one of the most respected tradesmen in Manchester.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peered forward, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye-glasses, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then took
off, holding them up in the air by their short handle. Sophia had
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Scales?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a very quiet, very benevolent voice. Sophia
nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Please come this way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) hand, squeezing it
commiseratingly, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) into the sanctum. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't expect you so
soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I looked up th' trains, and I didn't see how you could
get here before six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia explained.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) further, through the private office, into a sort of parlour,
and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to sit down. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too sat down. Sophia waited, as it
were, like a suitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I've got bad news for you, Mrs. Scales,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, still in
that mild, benevolent voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)'s dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked.

<p/>Mr. Till Boldero nodded. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)'s dead. I may as well tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) had
passed away before I telegraphed. It all happened very, very suddenly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Very, very suddenly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, weakly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was conscious of a profound sadness
which was not grief, though it resembled grief. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had also a
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was responsible to Mr. Till Boldero for anything
untoward that might have occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) by reason of Gerald.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Till Boldero, deliberately and softly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) came in last
night just as we were closing. We had very heavy rain here. I don't
know how it was with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) was wet, in a dreadful state, simply
dreadful. Of course, I didn't recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>). I'd never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) before,
so far as my recollection goes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) asked me if I was the son of Mr.
Till Boldero that had this shop in 1866. I said I was. ``Well,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) says,
`you're the only connection I've got. My name's Gerald Scales. My
mother was your father's cousin. Can you do anything for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) says.
I could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was ill. I had him (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) in here. When I found he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) couldn't eat
nor drink I thought I'd happen better send for th' doctor. The doctor
got him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) passed away at one o'clock this afternoon. I was
very sorry my wife wasn't here to look after things a bit better. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s at Southport, not well at all.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>Sophia asked briefly.

<p/>Mr. Boldero indicated the enigmatic. <div class="bookquote">``Exhaustion, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)
replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)'s here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>demanded Sophia, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes to possible bedrooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boldero. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you would wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) for a long time, your sister told me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Boldero murmured, sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not since `seventy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear! Eh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Mr. Boldero. <div class="bookquote">``I fear it's been a sad
business for ye, Mrs. Scales. Not since `seventy!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``You must
take it as well as you can. I'm not one as talks much, but I
sympathize, with you. I do that! I wish my wife had been here to
receive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears came into Sophia's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You must bear up now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's you that make me cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, gratefully. <div class="bookquote">``You were very
good to take him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in. It must have been exceedingly trying for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) protested, <div class="bookquote">``you mustn't talk like that. I couldn't leave a
Boldero on the pavement, and an old man at that! ... Oh, to think that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d only managed to please his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might ha' been one of the
richest men in Lancashire. But then there'd ha' been no Boldero
Institute at Strangeways!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) added.

<p/>They both sat silent a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come now? Or will you wait a bit?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Boldero, gently.
<div class="bookquote">``Just as you wish. I'm sorry as my wife's away, that I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, firmly. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was stricken.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) up a short, dark flight of stairs, which gave on a
passage, and at the end of the passage was a door ajar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) pushed the
door open. <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you for a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) said, always in the same
very restrained tone. <div class="bookquote">``You'll find me downstairs, there, if you want
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) moved away with hushed, deliberate tread.

<p/>Sophia went into the room, of which the white blind was drawn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
appreciated Mr. Boldero's consideration in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
trembling. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw, in the pale gloom, the face of an aged man
peeping out from under a white sheet on a naked mattress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) started
back, trembling no more--rather transfixed into an absolute rigidity.
That was no conventional, expected shock that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had received. It was
a genuine unforeseen shock, the most violent that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had ever had. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not pictured Gerald as a very old man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was old; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had said to herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be very old, well over
seventy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not pictured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This face on the bed was
painfully, pitiably old. A withered face, with the shiny skin all drawn
into wrinkles! The stretched skin under the jaw was like the skin of a
plucked fowl. The cheek-bones stood up, and below them were deep
hollows, almost like egg-cups. A short, scraggy white beard covered the
lower part of the face. The hair was scanty, irregular, and quite
white; a little white hair grew in the ears. The shut mouth obviously
hid toothless gums, for the lips were sucked in. The eyelids were as if
pasted down over the eyes, fitting them like kid. All the skin was
extremely pallid; it seemed brittle. The body, whose outlines were
clear under the sheet, was very small, thin, shrunk, pitiable as the
face. And on the face was a general expression of final fatigue, of
tragic and acute exhaustion; such as made Sophia pleased that the
fatigue and exhaustion had been assuaged in rest, while all the time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kept thinking to herself horribly: <div class="bookquote">``Oh! how tired he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have
been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia then experienced a pure and primitive emotion, uncoloured by any
moral or religious quality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not sorry that Gerald had wasted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) life, nor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was a shame to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) years and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). The manner
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) life was of no importance. What affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had
once been young, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had grown old, and was now dead. That was
all. Youth and vigour had come to that. Youth and vigour always came to
that. Everything came to that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had ill-treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had abandoned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had been a devious rascal; but how trivial were such
accusations against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>)! The whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) huge and bitter grievance
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) fell to pieces and crumbled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) young, and proud,
and strong, as for instance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lying on the bed in
that London hotel--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) forgot the name--in 1866; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) was old,
and worn, and horrible, and dead. It was the riddle of life that was
puzzling and killing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). By the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eye, reflected in the
mirror of a wardrobe near the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) glimpsed a tall, forlorn woman,
who had once been young and now was old; who had once exulted in
abundant strength, and trodden proudly on the neck of circumstance, and
now was old. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had once loved and burned and quarrelled in the
glittering and scornful pride of youth. But time had worn them out.
<div class="bookquote">``Yet a little while,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall be lying on a bed like
that! And what shall I have lived for? What is the meaning of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The
riddle of life itself was killing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) seemed to drown in a sea
of inexpressible sorrow.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) memory wandered hopelessly among those past years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw Chirac
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) wistful smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>) whipped over the roof of the Gare
du Nord at the tail of a balloon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw old Niepce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Chirac</b></font>)
lecherous arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was as old now as Niepce had been then.
Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) excite lust now? Ah! the irony of such a question! To be
young and seductive, to be able to kindle a man's eye--that seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) the sole thing desirable. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been so! ... Niepce must
certainly have been dead for years. Niepce, the obstinate and hopeful
voluptuary, was nothing but a few bones in a coffin now!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was acquainted with affliction in that hour. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
previously suffered sank into insignificance by the side of that
suffering.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned to the veiled window and idly pulled the blind and looked
out. Huge red and yellow cars were swimming in thunder along Deansgate;
lorries jolted and rattled; the people of Manchester hurried along the
pavements, apparently unconscious that all their doings were vain.
Yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) too had been in Deansgate, hungry for life, hating the
idea of death! What a figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must have made! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) heart dissolved in
pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) dropped the blind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My life has been too terrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I was dead. I
have been through too much. It is monstrous, and I cannot stand it. I
do not want to die, but I wish I was dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a discreet knock on the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, in a calm, resigned, cheerful voice. The sound had
recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with the swiftness of a miracle to the unconquerable
dignity of human pride.

<p/>Mr. Till Boldero entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like you to come downstairs and drink a cup of tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) was a marvel of tact and good nature. <div class="bookquote">``My wife is unfortunately not
here, and the house is rather at sixes and sevens; but I have sent out
for some tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) downstairs into the parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) poured out a cup of
tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was forgetting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am forbidden tea. I mustn't drink it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) looked at the cup, tremendously tempted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) longed for tea. An
occasional transgression could not harm her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). But no! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would not
drink it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what can I get you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could have just milk and water,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said meekly.

<p/>Mr. Boldero emptied the cup into the slop basin, and began to fill it
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tell you anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked, after a considerable silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boldero in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) low, soothing tones. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing except
that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had come from Liverpool. Judging from his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shoes I should say he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
must have walked a good bit of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) age!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Sophia, touched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>sighed Mr. Boldero. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have been in great straits. You
know, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could scarcely talk at all. By the way, here are his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) clothes.
I have had them put aside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sophia saw a small pile of clothes on a chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) examined the suit,
which was still damp, and its woeful shabbiness pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). The linen
collar was nearly black, its stud of bone. As for the boots, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
noticed such boots on the feet of tramps. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) wept now. These were the
clothes of him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) who had once been a dandy living at the rate of fifty
pounds a week.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No luggage or anything, of course?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boldero. <div class="bookquote">``In the pockets there was nothing whatever but
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) went to the mantelpiece and picked up a cheap, cracked letter case,
which Sophia opened. In it were a visiting card--``Senorita Clemenzia
Borja'--and a bill-head of the Hotel of the Holy Spirit, Concepcion del
Uruguay, on the back of which a lot of figures had been scrawled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One would suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boldero, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had come from South
America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerald/Mr. Scales/Gerald Scales</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerald's soul had not been compelled to abandon much in the haste of
its flight.

<p/>A servant announced that Mrs. Scales's friends were waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>)
outside in the motor-car. Sophia glanced at Mr. Till Boldero with an
exacerbated anxiety on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely they don't expect me to go back with them tonight!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``And look at all there is to be done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boldero/Mr. Till Boldero/Boldero</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Till Boldero's kindness was then redoubled. <div class="bookquote">``You can do nothing for
HIM now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldero</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me your wishes about the funeral. I will
arrange everything. Go back to your sister to-night. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will be
nervous about you. And return tomorrow or the day after... No! It's no
trouble, I assure you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) yielded.

<p/>Thus towards eight o'clock, when Sophia had eaten a little under Mr.
Boldero's superintendence, and the pawnshop was shut up, the motor-car
started again for Bursley, Lily Holl being beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) lover and Sophia
alone in the body of the car. Sophia had told them nothing of the
nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mission. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was incapable of talking to them. They saw
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in a condition of serious mental disturbance. Under cover
of the noise of the car, Lily said to Dick that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was sure Mrs.
Scales was ill, and Dick, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) lips together, replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
meant to be in King Street at nine-thirty at the latest. From time to
time Lily surreptitiously glanced at Sophia--a glance of apprehensive
inspection, or smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) silently; and Sophia vaguely responded to
the smile.

<p/>In half an hour they had escaped from the ring of Manchester and were
on the county roads of Cheshire, polished, flat, sinuous. It was the
season of the year when there is no night--only daylight and twilight;
when the last silver of dusk remains obstinately visible for hours. And
in the open country, under the melancholy arch of evening, the sadness
of the earth seemed to possess Sophia anew. Only then did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) realize
the intensity of the ordeal through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was passing.

<p/>To the south of Congleton one of the tyres softened, immediately after
Dick had lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) lamps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) stopped the car and got down again. They
were two miles Astbury, the nearest village. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had just, with the
resignation of experience, reached for the tool-bag, when Lily
exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) asleep, or what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>Sophia was not asleep, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
apparently not conscious.

<p/>It was a difficult and a trying situation for two lovers. Their voices
changed momentarily to the tone of alarm and consternation, and then
grew firm again. Sophia showed life but not reason. Lily could feel the
poor old lady's heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's nothing for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick, briefly, when all their
efforts failed to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--shall you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go straight home as quick as I can on three tyres. We must get her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
over to this side, and you must hold her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Like that we shall keep the
weight off the other side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) pitched back the tool-bag into its box. Lily admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) decision.

<p/>It was in this order, no longer under the spell of the changing beauty
of nocturnal landscapes, that they finished the journey. Constance had
opened the door before the car came to a stop in the gloom of King
Street. The young people considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) bore the shock well,
though the carrying into the house of Sophia's inert, twitching body,
with its hat forlornly awry, was a sight to harrow a soul sturdier than
Constance.

<p/>When that was done, Dick said curtly: <div class="bookquote">``I'm off. You stay here, of
course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>asked Lily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>snapped Dick, hobbling rapidly down the steps.

<p/>IV

<p/>The extraordinary violence of the turn in affairs was what chiefly
struck Constance, though it did not overwhelm her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). Less than twelve
hours before--nay, scarcely six hours before--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) and Sophia had been
living their placid and monotonous existence, undisturbed by anything
worse than the indisposition or death of dogs, or the perversity of a
servant. And now, the menacing Gerald Scales having reappeared,
Sophia's form lay mysterious and affrightening on the sofa; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and
Lily Holl, a girl whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not met till that day, were staring at
Sophia side by side, intimately sharing the same alarm. Constance rose
to the crisis. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) no longer had Sophia's energy and decisive
peremptoriness to depend on, and the Baines in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was awakened. All
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) daily troubles sank away to their proper scale of unimportance.
Neither the young woman nor the old one knew what to do. They could
loosen clothes, vainly offer restoratives to the smitten mouth: that
was all. Sophia was not unconscious, as could be judged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) eyes;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not speak, nor make signs; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) body was frequently
convulsed. So the two women waited, and the servant waited in the
background. The sight of Sophia had effected an astonishing
transformation in Maud. Maud was a changed girl. Constance could not
recognize, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) eager deferential anxiety to be of use, the pert
naughtiness of the minx. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) was altered as a wanton of the middle ages
would have been altered by some miraculous visitation. It might have
been the turning-point in Maud's career!

<p/>Doctor Stirling arrived in less than ten minutes. Dick Povey had had
the wit to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) at the Federation meeting in the Town Hall. And
the advent of the doctor and Dick, noisily, at breakneck speed in the
car, provided a second sensation. The doctor inquired quickly what had
occurred. Nobody could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) anything. Constance had already
confided to Lily Holl the reason of the visit to Manchester; but that
was the extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) knowledge. Not a single person in Bursley, except
Sophia, knew what had happened in Manchester. But Constance conjectured
that Gerald Scales was dead--or Sophia would never have returned so
soon. Then the doctor suggested that on the contrary Gerald Scales
might be out of danger. And all then pictured to themselves this
troubling Gerald Scales, this dark and sinister husband that had caused
such a violent upheaval.

<p/>Meanwhile the doctor was at work. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sent Dick Povey to knock up
Critchlow's, if the shop should be closed, and obtain a drug. Then,
after a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) lifted Sophia, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, like a bundle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
shoulder, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) single-handed upstairs to the second floor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had recently been giving a course of instruction to enthusiasts of
the St. John's Ambulance Association in Bursley. The feat had an air of
the superhuman. Above all else it remained printed on Constance's mind:
the burly doctor treading delicately and carefully on the crooked,
creaking stairs, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) precautions against damaging Sophia by brusque
contacts, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stumble at the two steps in the middle of the corridor;
Sophia's horribly limp head and loosened hair; and then the tender
placing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) on the bed, and the doctor's long breath and flourish of
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) large handkerchief, all that under the crude lights and shadows of
gas jets! The doctor was nonplussed. Constance gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) a second-hand
account of Sophia's original attack in Paris, roughly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had heard
it from Sophia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) at once said that it could not have been what the
French doctor had said it was. Constance shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) shoulders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
was not surprised. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) there was necessarily something of the
charlatan about a French doctor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) only knew what Sophia had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). After a time Dr. Stirling determined to try electricity, and
Dick Povey drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) up to the surgery to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) apparatus. The
women were left alone again. Constance was very deeply impressed by
Lily Holl's sensible, sympathetic attitude. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever I should have
done without Miss Lily I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) used to exclaim afterwards.
Even Maud was beyond praise. It seemed to be the middle of the night
when Dr. Stirling came back, but it was barely eleven o'clock, and
people were only just returning from Hanbridge Theatre and Hanbridge
Music Hall. The use of the electrical apparatus was a dead spectacle.
Sophia's inertness under it was agonizing. They waited, as it were,
breathless for the result. And there was no result. Both injections and
electricity had entirely failed to influence the paralysis of Sophia's
mouth and throat. Everything had failed. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing to do but wait a
bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor quietly. They waited in the chamber. Sophia
seemed to be in a kind of coma. The distortion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) handsome face was
more marked as time passed. The doctor spoke now and then in a low
voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said that the attack had ultimately been determined by cold
produced by rapid motion in the automobile. Dick Povey whispered that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) must run over to Hanbridge and let Lily's parents know that there
was no cause for alarm on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) account, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) would return at
once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) was very devoted. On the landing out-side the bedroom, the
doctor murmured to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``U.P.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And Dick nodded. They were great friends.

<p/>At intervals the doctor, who never knew when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was beaten, essayed new
methods of dealing with Sophia's case. New symptoms followed. It was
half-past twelve when, after gazing with prolonged intensity at the
patient, and after having tested her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mouth and heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) rose slowly
and looked at Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's over?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) very slightly moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Come downstairs, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
enjoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), in a pause that ensued. Constance was amazingly
courageous. The doctor was very solemn and very kind; Constance had
never before seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to such heroic advantage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with
infinite gentleness out of the room. There was nothing to stay for;
Sophia had gone. Constance wanted to stay by Sophia's body; but it was
the rule that the stricken should be led away, the doctor observed this
classic rule, and Constance felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was right and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) must
obey. Lily Holl followed. The servant, learning the truth by the
intuition accorded to primitive natures, burst into loud sobs, yelling
that Sophia had been the most excellent mistress that servant ever had.
The doctor angrily told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) not to stand blubbering there, but to go
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) kitchen and shut the door if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) couldn't control herself. All
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) accumulated nervous agitation was discharged on Maud like a
thunderclap. Constance continued to behave wonderfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) was the
admiration of the doctor and Lily Holl. Then Dick Povey came back. It
was settled that Lily should pass the night with Constance. At last the
doctor and Dick departed together, the doctor undertaking the mortuary
arrangements. Maud was hunted to bed.

<p/>Early in the morning Constance rose up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) own bed. It was five
o'clock, and there had been daylight for two hours already. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maud</b></font>) moved
noiselessly and peeped over the foot of the bed at the sofa. Lily was
quietly asleep there, breathing with the softness of a child. Lily
would have deemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was a very mature woman, who had seen life
and much of it. Yet to Constance her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) face and attitude had the
exquisite quality of a child's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was not precisely a pretty girl,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) features, the candid expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) disposition, produced an
impression that was akin to that of beauty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) abandonment was
complete. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had gone through the night unscathed, and was now
renewing herself in calm, oblivious sleep. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) ingenuous girlishness
was apparent then. It seemed as if all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) wise and sweet behaviour of
the evening could have been nothing but so many imitative gestures. It
seemed impossible that a being so young and fresh could have really
experienced the mood of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) gestures had been the expression. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
strong virginal simplicity made Constance vaguely sad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).

<p/>Creeping out of the room, Constance climbed to the second floor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
dressing-gown, and entered the other chamber. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was obliged to look
again upon Sophia's body. Incredible swiftness of calamity! Who could
have foreseen it? Constance was less desolated than numbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was as
yet only touching the fringe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bereavement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had not begun to
think of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was drenched, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) gazed at Sophia's body, not
by pity for herself, but by compassion for the immense disaster of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
sister's life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) perceived fully now for the first time the greatness
of that disaster. Sophia's charm and Sophia's beauty--what profit had
they been to their owner? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw pictures of Sophia's career,
distorted and grotesque images formed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) untravelled mind from
Sophia's own rare and compressed recitals. What a career! A brief
passion, and then nearly thirty years in a boarding-house! And Sophia
had never had a child; had never known either the joy or the pain of
maternity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never even had a true home till, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sterile
splendour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) came to Bursley. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had ended--thus! This was the
piteous, ignominious end of Sophia's wondrous gifts of body and soul.
Hers had not been a life at all. And the reason? It is strange how fate
persists in justifying the harsh generalizations of Puritan morals, of
the morals in which Constance had been brought up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) stern parents!
Sophia had sinned. It was therefore inevitable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should suffer.
An adventure such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had in wicked and capricious pride undertaken
with Gerald Scales, could not conclude otherwise than it had concluded.
It could have brought nothing but evil. There was no getting away from
these verities, thought Constance. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was to be excused for
thinking that all modern progress and cleverness was as naught, and
that the world would be forced to return upon its steps and start again
in the path which it had left.

<p/>Up to within a few days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) death people had been wont to remark
that Mrs. Scales looked as young as ever, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) was as bright
and as energetic as ever. And truly, regarding Sophia from a little
distance--that handsome oval, that erect carriage of a slim body, that
challenging eye!--no one would have said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sixtieth
year. But look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) now, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) twisted face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sightless orbs,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) worn skin--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not seem sixty, but seventy! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was like
something used, exhausted, and thrown aside! Yes, Constance's heart
melted in an anguished pity for that stormy creature. And mingled with
the pity was a stern recognition of the handiwork of divine justice. To
Constance's lips came the same phrase as had come to the lips of Samuel
Povey on a different occasion: God is not mocked! The ideas of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
parents and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) grandparents had survived intact in Constance. It is
true that Constance's father would have shuddered in Heaven could he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
have seen Constance solitarily playing cards of a night. But in spite
of cards, and of a son who never went to chapel, Constance, under the
various influences of destiny, had remained essentially what her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father
had been. Not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was the force of evolution manifest. There are
thousands such.

<p/>Lily, awake, and reclothed with that unreal mien of a grown and
comprehending woman, stepped quietly into the room, searching for the
poor old thing, Constance. The layer-out had come.

<p/>By the first post was delivered a letter addressed to Sophia by Mr.
Till Boldero. From its contents the death of Gerald Scales was clear.
There seemed then to be nothing else for Constance to do. What had to
be done was done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And stronger wills than hers put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) to bed.
Cyril was telegraphed for. Mr. Critchlow called, Mrs. Critchlow
following--a fussy infliction, but useful in certain matters. Mr.
Critchlow was not allowed to see Constance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) high
grating voice in the corridor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had to lie calm, and the sudden
tranquillity seemed strange after the feverish violence of the night.
Only twenty-four hours since, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had been worrying about the death
of a dog! With a body crying for sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) dozed off, thoughts of the
mystery of life merging into the incoherence of dreams.

<p/>The news was abroad in the Square before nine o'clock. There were
persons who had witnessed the arrival of the motorcar, and the transfer
of Sophia to the house. Untruthful rumours had spread as to the manner
of Gerald Scales's death. Some said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) had dramatically committed
suicide. But the town, though titillated, was not moved as it would
have been moved by a similar event twenty years, or even ten years
earlier. Times had changed in Bursley. Bursley was more sophisticated
than in the old days.

<p/>Constance was afraid lest Cyril, despite the seriousness of the
occasion, might exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) customary tardiness in coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had long
since learnt not to rely upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) came the same evening. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
behaviour was in every way perfect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) showed quiet but genuine grief
for the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) aunt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was a model of consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
mother. Further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) at once assumed charge of all the arrangements, in
regard both to Sophia and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) husband. Constance was surprised at
the ease which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) displayed in the conduct of practical affairs, and
the assurance with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) gave orders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) direct
anything before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had never directed anything
before, but that there appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to be no difficulties. Whereas
Constance had figured a tiresome series of varied complications. As to
the burial of Sophia, Cyril was vigorously in favour of an absolutely
private funeral; that is to say, a funeral at which none but himself
should be present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) seemed to have a passionate objection to any sort
of parade. Constance agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said that it would be
impossible not to invite Mr. Critchlow, Sophia's trustee, and that if
Mr. Critchlow were invited certain others must be invited. Cyril asked:
<div class="bookquote">``Why impossible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>Constance said: <div class="bookquote">``Because it would be impossible.
Because Mr. Critchlow would be hurt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Cyril asked: <div class="bookquote">``What does it matter
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) is hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>and suggested that Mr. Critchlow would get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
damage. Constance grew more serious. The discussion threatened to be
warm. Suddenly Cyril yielded. <div class="bookquote">``All right, Mrs. Plover, all right! It
shall be exactly as you choose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) said, in a gentle, humouring tone.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had not called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ``Mrs. Plover' for years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) thought the hour
badly chosen for verbal pleasantry, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was so kind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) made no
complaint. Thus there were six people at Sophia's funeral, including
Mr. Critchlow. No refreshments were offered. The mourners separated at
the church. When both funerals were accomplished Cyril sat down and
played the harmonium softly, and said that it had kept well in tune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
was extraordinarily soothing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had now reached the age of thirty-three. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) habits were as
industrious as ever, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) preoccupation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) art as keen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had
achieved no fame, no success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) earned nothing, living in comfort on
an allowance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) seldom spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) plans and never of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had in fact settled down into a dilletante, having learnt
gently to scorn the triumphs which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) lacked the force to win. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
imagined that industry and a regular existence were sufficient
justification in themselves for any man's life. Constance had dropped
the habit of expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to astound the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was rather grave
and precise in manner, courteous and tepid, with a touch of
condescension towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) environment; as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) were continually
permitting the perspicacious to discern that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had nothing to
learn--if the truth were known! His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) humour had assumed a modified form.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) often smiled to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was unexceptionable.

<p/>On the day after Sophia's funeral he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) set to work to design a simple
stone for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) aunt's tomb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) could not tolerate the ordinary
gravestone, which always looked, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), as if the wind might blow it
over, thus negativing the idea of solidity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mother did not in the
least understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought the lettering of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) tombstone
affected and finicking. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) let it pass without comment, being
secretly very flattered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) should have deigned to design a stone
at all.

<p/>Sophia had left all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) money to Cyril, and had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) the sole
executor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) will. This arrangement had been agreed with Constance.
The sisters thought it was the best plan. Cyril ignored Mr. Critchlow
entirely, and went to a young lawyer at Hanbridge, a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and
of Matthew Peel-Swynnerton's. Mr. Critchlow, aged and unaccustomed to
interference, had to render accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) trusteeship to this young
man, and was incensed. The estate was proved at over thirty-five
thousand pounds. In the main, Sophia had been careful, and had even
been parsimonious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had often told Constance that they ought to
spend money much more freely, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had had a few brief fits of
extravagance. But the habit of stern thrift, begun in 1870 and
practised without any intermission till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) came to England in 1897,
had been too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) theories. The squandering of money pained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) could not, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) age, devise expensive tastes.

<p/>Cyril showed no emotion whatever on learning himself the inheritor of
thirty-five thousand pounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) did not seem to care. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) spoke of the
sum as a millionaire might have spoken of it. In justice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) it is
to be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) cared nothing for wealth, except in so far as wealth
could gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) eye and ear trained to artistic voluptuousness. But,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother's sake, and for the sake of Bursley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) might have
affected a little satisfaction. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother was somewhat hurt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)
behaviour caused her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to revert in meditation again and again to the
futility of Sophia's career, and the waste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) attributes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
grown old and hard in joyless years in order to amass this money which
Cyril would spend coldly and ungratefully, never thinking of the
immense effort and endless sacrifice which had gone to its collection.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) would spend it as carelessly as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had picked it up in the
street. As the days went by and Constance realized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own grief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
also realized more and more the completeness of the tragedy of Sophia's
life. Headstrong Sophia had deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother, and for the deception
had paid with thirty years of melancholy and the entire frustration of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) proper destiny.

<p/>After haunting Bursley for a fortnight in elegant black, Cyril said,
without any warning, one night: <div class="bookquote">``I must go the day after to-morrow,
mater.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cyril/Mr. Cyril/CYRIL</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) of a journey to Hungary which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had long since
definitely planned with Matthew Peel-Swynnerton, and which could not be
postponed, as it comprised <div class="bookquote">``business.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Peel-Swynnerton/Matthew Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) had hitherto breathed no word
of this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) was as secretive as ever. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) holiday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel-Swynnerton</b></font>) suggested
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should arrange to go away with the Holls and Dick Povey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
approved of Lily Holl and of Dick Povey. Of Dick Povey he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>)'s
one of the most remarkable chaps in the Five Towns.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had the air
of having made Dick's reputation. Constance, knowing there was no
appeal, accepted the sentence of loneliness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) health was singularly
good.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Scarcely a fortnight and Sophia
was here at this table!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) would remember every now and then, with a
faint shock, that poor, proud, masterful Sophia was dead.




<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>END OF CONSTANCE

<p/>I


<p/>When, on a June afternoon about twelve months later, Lily Holl walked
into Mrs. Povey's drawing-room overlooking the Square, she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) found a
calm, somewhat optimistic old lady--older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) years--which were
little more than sixty--whose chief enemies were sciatica and
rheumatism. The sciatica was a dear enemy of long standing, always
affectionately referred to by the forgiving Constance as `my sciatica';
the rheumatism was a new-comer, unprivileged, spoken of by its victim
apprehensively and yet disdainfully as `this rheumatism.'' Constance was
now very stout. She (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) sat in a low easy-chair between the oval table and
the window, arrayed in black silk. As the girl Lily came in, Constance
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) head with a bland smile, and Lily kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>), contentedly.
Lily knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was a welcome visitor. These two had become as
intimate as the difference between their ages would permit; of the two,
Constance was the more frank. Lily as well as Constance was in
mourning. A few months previously her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) aged grandfather, <div class="bookquote">``Holl, the
grocer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had died. The second of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) two sons, Lily's father, had then
left the business established by the brothers at Hanbridge in order to
manage, for a time, the parent business in St. Luke's Square. Alderman
Holl's death had delayed Lily's marriage. Lily took tea with Constance,
or at any rate paid a call, four or five times a week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) listened to
Constance.

<p/>Everybody considered that Constance had `come splendidly through' the
dreadful affair of Sophia's death. Indeed, it was observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was
more philosophic, more cheerful, more sweet, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been for many
years. The truth was that, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bereavement had been the cause of
a most genuine and durable sorrow, it had been a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). When
Constance was over fifty, the energetic and masterful Sophia had burst
in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lethargic tranquillity and very seriously disturbed the
flow of old habits. Certainly Constance had fought Sophia on the main
point, and won; but on a hundred minor points she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had either lost or
had not fought. Sophia had been `too much' for Constance, and it had
been only by a wearying expenditure of nervous force that Constance had
succeeded in holding a small part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own against the unconscious
domination of Sophia. The death of Mrs. Scales had put an end to all
the strain, and Constance had been once again mistress in Constance's
house. Constance would never have admitted these facts, even to
herself; and no one would ever have dared to suggest them to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). For
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) temperamental mildness she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) formidable side.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was slipping a photograph into a plush-covered photograph album.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More photographs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>Lily questioned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had almost exactly the same
benignant smile that Constance had. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) seemed to be the
personification of gentleness--one of those feather-beds that some
capricious men occasionally have the luck to marry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was capable,
with a touch of honest, simple stupidity. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) character was
displayed in the tone in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``More photographs?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It showed
an eager responsive sympathy with Constance's cult for photographs,
also a slight personal fondness for photographs, also a dim perception
that a cult for photographs might be carried to the ridiculous, and a
kind desire to hide all trace of this perception. The voice was thin,
and matched the pale complexion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) delicate face.

<p/>Constance's eyes had a quizzical gleam behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) spectacles as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
silently held up the photograph for Lily's inspection.

<p/>Lily, sitting down, lowered the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) soft lips when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
beheld the photograph, and nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) head several times, scarce
perceptibly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) ladyship has just given it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>whispered Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily, with an extraordinary accent.

<p/>``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) ladyship' was the last and best of Constance's servants, a really
excellent creature of thirty, who had known misfortune, and who must
assuredly have been sent to Constance by the old watchful Providence.
They `got on together' nearly perfectly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) name was Mary. After ten
years of turmoil, Constance in the matter of servants was now at rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>)'s named it to me several times--about
having her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) photograph taken, and last week I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) go. I told you,
didn't I? I always consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) in every way, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) little fancies
and everything. And the copies came to-day. I wouldn't hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>)
feelings for anything. You may be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>)'ll take a look into the
album next time she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) cleans the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance and Lily exchanged a glance agreeing that Constance had
affably stretched a point in deciding to put the photograph of a
servant between the same covers with photographs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) family and
friends. It was doubtful whether such a thing had ever been done before.

<p/>One photograph usually leads to another, and one photograph album to
another photograph album.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pass me that album on the second shelf of the Canterbury; my dear,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/>Lily rose vivaciously, as though to see the album on the second shelf
of the Canterbury had been the ambition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) life.

<p/>They sat side by side at the table, Lily turning over the pages.
Constance, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) vast bulk, continually made little nervous
movements. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would sniff and occasionally a mysterious
noise would occur in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) chest; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) always pretended that this noise
was a cough, and would support the pretence by emitting a real cough
immediately after it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lily. <div class="bookquote">``Have I seen that before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``HAVE you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a photograph of Sophia taken a few years previously by 'a very
nice gentleman,'' whose acquaintance the sisters had made during a
holiday at Harrogate. It portrayed Sophia on a knoll, fronting the
weather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Mrs. Scales to the life--I can see that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``Whenever there was a wind she (<font color='blue'><b>Scales</b></font>) always stood like
that, and took long deep breaths of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Miss Sophia/SOPHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>This recollection of one of Sophia's habits recalled the whole woman to
Constance's memory, and drew a picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) character for the girl
who had scarcely known her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not like ordinary photographs. There's something special about
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily, enthusiastically. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I ever saw a
photograph like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got another copy of it in my bedroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. <div class="bookquote">``I'll give
you this one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Povey! I couldn't think--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, removing the photograph from the page.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, THANK you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that reminds me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, getting up with great difficulty
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I find anything for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>Lily asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, leaving the room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) returned in a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) jewel-box, a receptacle of ebony with
ivory ornamentations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've always meant to give you this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, taking from the
box a fine cameo brooch. <div class="bookquote">``I don't seem to fancy wearing it myself. And
I should like to see you wearing it. It was mother's. I believe they're
coming into fashion again. I don't see why you shouldn't wear it while
you're in mourning. They aren't half so strict now about mourning as
they used to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>murmured Lily, ecstatically. They kissed. Constance seemed to
breathe out benevolence, as with trembling hands she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) pinned the brooch
at Lily's neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) lavished the warm treasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) heart on Lily,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) regarded as an almost perfect girl, and who had become the
idol of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) latter years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a magnificent old watch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily, as they delved together in
the lower recesses of the box. <div class="bookquote">``AND the chain to it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was father's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always used to swear by it.
When it didn't agree with the Town Hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used to say: ``Then th' Town
Hall's wrong.<div class="bookquote">'' And it's curious, the Town Hall WAS wrong. You know the

giving that watch and chain to Dick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HAVE you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It's just as good as it was when father wore it. My husband never
would wear it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had little fancies like that.
And Cyril takes after his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) father.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) spoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) `dry' tone. <div class="bookquote">``I've
almost decided to give it to Dick--that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) behaves himself. Is
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) still on with this ballooning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div><p/>Lily Smiled guiltily: <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, <div class="bookquote">``I never heard the like! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'s been up and
come down safely, that ought to be enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>). I wonder you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
do it, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can I stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)? I've no control over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you mean to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'d still do it if you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) seriously

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily; and added: <div class="bookquote">``So I shan't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) head, musing over the secret nature of men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
remembered too well the cruel obstinacy of Samuel, who had nevertheless
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). And Dick Povey was a thousand times more bizarre than
Samuel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) vividly, a little boy, whizzing down King Street on
a boneshaker, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cap flying off. Afterwards it had been
motor-cars! Now it was balloons! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sighed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was struck by the
profound instinctive wisdom just enunciated by the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall see. I've not made up my mind yet. What's
the young man doing this afternoon, by the way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s gone to Birmingham to try to sell two motor-lorries. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't be
back home till late. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s coming over here to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an excellent illustration of Dick Povey's methods that at this
very moment Lily heard in the Square the sound of a motor-car, which
happened to be Dick's car. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sprang up to look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) cried, flushing. <div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us, bless us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>muttered Constance, closing the box.

<p/>When Dick, having left his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) car in King Street, limped tempestuously
into the drawing-room, galvanizing it by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) abundant vitality into a
new life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cried joyously: <div class="bookquote">``Sold my lorries! Sold my lorries!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
explained that by a charming accident he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had disposed of them to a
chance buyer in Hanbridge, just before starting for Birmingham. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
had telephoned to Birmingham that the matter was <div class="bookquote">``off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then, being
`at a loose end,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had come over to Bursley in search of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
betrothed. At Holl's shop they had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) was with Mrs.
Povey. Constance glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), impressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) jolly air of success.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) seemed exactly like his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) breezy and self-confident advertisements in
the Signal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was absolutely pleased with himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) triumphed over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) limp--that ever-present reminder of a tragedy. Who would dream, to
look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) blond, laughing, scintillating face, astonishingly young
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) years, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) had once passed through such a night as that on
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) father had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) mother while he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) lay immovable and
cursing, with a broken knee, in bed? Constance had heard all about that
scene from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused in wonder at the contrasting
hazards of existence.

<p/>Dick Povey brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) hands together with a resounding smack, and then
rubbed them rapidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``AND a good price, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) exclaimed blithely. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Povey, I don't
mind telling you that I've netted seventy pounds odd this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div><p/>Lily's eyes expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) proud joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope pride won't have a fall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, with a calm smile out
of which peeped a hint of a rebuke. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I hope. I must just go
and see about tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stay for tea--really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, positively. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose you'd been at
Birmingham? It's weeks since you stayed to tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>Dick yielded, rather snubbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't I save you a journey, Mrs. Povey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>Lily asked, eagerly
thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, my dear. There are one or two little things that need
my attention.''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>And Constance departed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) jewel-box.

<p/>Dick, having assured himself that the door was closed, assaulted Lily
with a kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Been here long?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About an hour and a half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old lady's in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) humours, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! Only she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was just talking about balloons--you know. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s very
much up in arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) off balloons. Balloons may be the ruin of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
wedding-present to us, my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick! How can you talk like that? ... It's all very well saying I
ought to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) off balloons. You try to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) off balloons when
once she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) begins, and see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What started her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was thinking of giving you old Mr. Baines's gold watch
and chain--if you behaved yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I seen it? I should say I had seen it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s mentioned it once or
twice before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I didn't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see myself carting that thing about. I much prefer my own.
What do you think of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is rather clumsy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily. <div class="bookquote">``But if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) offered it to
you, you couldn't refuse it, and you'd simply have to wear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick, <div class="bookquote">``I must try to behave myself just badly enough
to keep off the watch, but not badly enough to upset her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) notions about
wedding-presents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>Lily murmured, compassionately.

<p/>Then Lily put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) hand silently to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s just given it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick approached very near to examine the cameo brooch. <div class="bookquote">``Hm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
murmured. It was an adverse verdict. And Lily coincided with it by a
lift of the eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose you'll have to wear that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) values it as much as anything she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s got, poor old thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said
Lily. <div class="bookquote">``It belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says cameos are coming into
fashion again. It really is rather good, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) learnt that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick, drily. <div class="bookquote">``I see you've been
suffering from the photographs again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily, <div class="bookquote">``I much prefer the photographs to helping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
play Patience. The way she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheats herself--it's too silly! I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) stopped. The door which had after all not been latched, was pushed
open, and the antique Fossette introduced herself painfully into the
room. Fossette had an affection for Dick Povey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Methusaleh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) greeted the animal loudly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) could scarcely
wag her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) tail, nor shake the hair out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) dim eyes in order to look
up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) stooped to pat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That dog does smell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily, bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you expect? What she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wants is the least dose of prussic acid.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a burden to herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's funny that if you venture to hint to Mrs. Povey that the dog is
offensive she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) gets quite peppery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's very simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick. <div class="bookquote">``Don't hint, that's all! Hold
your nose and your tongue too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick, I do wish you wouldn't be so absurd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance returned into the room, cutting short the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Povey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick, in a voice full of gratitude, <div class="bookquote">``Lily has just
been showing me her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) brooch--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) paid no heed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), but passed hurriedly to the
window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's amiss in the Square?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``When I was in the
parlour just now I saw a man running along Wedgwood Street, and I said
to myself, what's amiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick and Lily joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) at the window.

<p/>Several people were hurrying down the Square, and then a man came
running with a doctor from the market-place. All these persons
disappeared from view under the window of Mrs. Povey's drawing-room,
which was over part of Mrs. Critchlow's shop. As the windows of the
shop projected beyond the walls of the house it was impossible, from
the drawing-room window, to see the pavement in front of the shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be something on the pavement--or in the shop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>murmured
Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ma'am!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a startled voice behind the three. It was Mary,
original of the photograph, who had run unperceived into the
drawing-room. <div class="bookquote">``They say as Mrs. Critchlow has tried to commit suicide!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>Constance started back. Lily went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>), with an instinctive
gesture of supporting consolation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maria Critchlow tried to commit suicide!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am! But they say she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)'s not done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove! I'd better go and see if I can help, hadn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>cried Dick
Povey, hobbling off, excited and speedy. <div class="bookquote">``Strange, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
exclaimed afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``how I manage to come in for things? Sheer chance
that I was here to-day! But it's always like that! Somehow something
extraordinary is always happening where I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And this too ministered
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) satisfaction, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) zest for life.

<p/>II

<p/>When, in the evening, after all sorts of comings and goings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) finally
returned to the old lady and the young one, in order to report the
upshot, his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) demeanour was suitably toned to Constance's mood. The old
lady had been very deeply disturbed by the tragedy, which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said,
had passed under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very feet while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was calmly talking to Lily.

<p/>The whole truth came out in a short space of time. Mrs. Critchlow was
suffering from melancholia. It appeared that for long she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had been
depressed by the failing trade of the shop, which was none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
fault. The state of the Square had steadily deteriorated. Even the
``Vaults' were not what they once were. Four or five shops had been shut
up, as it were definitely, the landlords having given up hope of
discovering serious tenants. And, of those kept open, the majority were
struggling desperately to make ends meet. Only Holl's and a new upstart
draper, who had widely advertised his (<font color='blue'><b>draper</b></font>) dress-making department, were
really flourishing. The confectionery half of Mr. Brindley's business
was disappearing. People would not go to Hanbridge for their bread or
for their groceries, but they would go for their cakes. These electric
trams had simply carried to Hanbridge the cream, and much of the milk,
of Bursley's retail trade. There were unprincipled tradesmen in
Hanbridge ready to pay the car-fares of any customer who spent a crown
in their establishments. Hanbridge was the geographical centre of the
Five Towns, and it was alive to its situation. Useless for Bursley to
compete! If Mrs. Critchlow had been a philosopher, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had known
that geography had always made history, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) would have given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
enterprise a dozen years ago. But Mrs. Critchlow was merely Maria
Insull. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had seen Baines's in its magnificent prime, when Baines's
almost conferred a favour on customers in serving them. At the time
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) took over the business under the wing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) husband, it was
still a good business. But from that instant the tide had seemed to
turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had fought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) kept on fighting, stupidly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was not
aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was fighting against evolution, not aware that evolution
had chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) for one of its victims! She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) could understand that all
the other shops in the Square should fail, but not that Baines's should
fail! She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was as industrious as ever, as good a buyer, as good a
seller, as keen for novelties, as economical, as methodical! And yet
the returns dropped and dropped.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) naturally had no sympathy from Charles, who now took small interest
even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own business, or what was left of it, and who was coldly
disgusted at the ultimate cost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) marriage. Charles gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) no
money that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could avoid giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>). The crisis had been slowly
approaching for years. The assistants in the shop had said nothing, or
had only whispered among themselves, but now that the crisis had
flowered suddenly in an attempted self-murder, they all spoke at once,
and the evidences were pieced together into a formidable proof of the
strain which Mrs. Critchlow had suffered. It appeared that for many
months she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had been depressed and irritable, that sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) would
sit down in the midst of work and declare, with every sign of
exhaustion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) could do no more. Then with equal briskness she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
would arise and force herself to labour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) did not sleep for whole
nights. One assistant related how she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had complained of having had no
sleep whatever for four nights consecutively. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had noises in the
ears and a chronic headache. Never very plump, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had grown thinner
and thinner. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was for ever taking pills: this information came
from Charles's manager. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had had several outrageous quarrels with
the redoubtable Charles, to the stupefaction of all who heard or saw
them... Mrs. Critchlow standing up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) husband! Another strange
thing was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) thought the bills of several of the big Manchester
firms were unpaid, when as a fact they had been paid. Even when shown
the receipts she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) would not be convinced, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) pretended to be
convinced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) would recommence the next day. All this was sufficiently
disconcerting for female assistants in the drapery. But what could they
do?

<p/>Then Maria Critchlow had gone a step further. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had summoned the
eldest assistant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) corner and had informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>), with all the
solemnity of a confession made to assuage a conscience which has been
tortured too long, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had on many occasions been guilty of sexual
irregularity with her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) late employer, Samuel Povey. There was no truth
whatever in this accusation -LRB-which everybody, however, took care not to
mention to Constance-RRB-; it merely indicated, perhaps, the secret
aspirations of Maria Insull, the virgin. The assistant was properly
scandalized, more by the crudity of Mrs. Critchlow's language than by
the alleged sin buried in the past. Goodness knows what the assistant
would have done! But two hours later Maria Critchlow tried to commit
suicide by stabbing herself with a pair of scissors. There was blood in
the shop.

<p/>With as little delay as possible she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had been driven away to the
asylum. Charles Critchlow, enveloped safely in the armour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) senile
egotism, had shown no emotion, and very little activity. The shop was
closed. And as a general draper's it never opened again. That was the
end of Baines's. Two assistants found themselves without a livelihood.
The small tumble with the great.

<p/>Constance's emotion was more than pardonable; it was justified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
could not eat and Lily could not persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to eat. In an unhappy
moment Dick Povey mentioned--he (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) never could remember how,
afterwards--the word Federation! And then Constance, from a passive
figure of grief became a menace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) overwhelmed Dick Povey with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
anathema of Federation, for Dick was a citizen of Hanbridge, where this
detestable movement for Federation had had its birth. All the
misfortunes of St. Luke's Square were due to that great, busy,
grasping, unscrupulous neighbour. Had not Hanbridge done enough,
without wanting to merge all the Five Towns into one town, of which of
course itself would be the centre? For Constance, Hanbridge was a
borough of unprincipled adventurers, bent on ruining the ancient
``Mother of the Five Towns' for its own glory and aggrandizement. Let
Constance hear no more of Federation! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) poor sister Sophia had been
dead against Federation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had been quite right! All really
respectable people were against it! The attempted suicide of Mrs.
Critchlow sealed the fate of Federation and damned it for ever, in
Constance's mind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) hatred of the idea of it was intensified into
violent animosity; insomuch that in the result she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) died a martyr to the
cause of Bursley's municipal independence.

<p/>III

<p/>It was on a muddy day in October that the first great battle for and
against Federation was fought in Bursley. Constance was suffering
severely from sciatica. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was also suffering from disgust with the
modern world.

<p/>Unimaginable things had happened in the Square. For Constance, the
reputation of the Square was eternally ruined. Charles Critchlow, by
that strange good fortune which always put him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) in the right when fairly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) ought to have been in the wrong, had let the Baines shop and his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) own
shop and house to the Midland Clothiers Company, which was establishing
branches throughout Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and
adjacent counties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) own chemist's stock and gone to live
in a little house at the bottom of Kingstreet. It is doubtful whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) would have consented to retire had not Alderman Holl died earlier in
the year, thus ending a long rivalry between the old men for the
patriarchate of the Square. Charles Critchlow was as free from
sentiment as any man, but no man is quite free from it, and the ancient
was in a position to indulge sentiment had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chosen. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business was
not a source of loss, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could still trust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skinny hands and
peering eyes to make up a prescription. However, the offer of the
Midland Clothiers Company tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and as the undisputed `father'
of the Square he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left the Square in triumph.

<p/>The Midland Clothiers Company had no sense of the proprieties of trade.
Their sole idea was to sell goods. Having possessed themselves of one
of the finest sites in a town which, after all was said and done,
comprised nearly forty thousand inhabitants, they set about to make the
best of that site. They threw the two shops into one, and they caused
to be constructed a sign compared to which the spacious old ``Baines'
sign was a postcard. They covered the entire frontage with posters of a
theatrical description--coloured posters! They occupied the front page
of the Signal, and from that pulpit they announced that winter was
approaching, and that they meant to sell ten thousand overcoats at
their new shop in Bursley at the price of twelve and sixpence each. The
tailoring of the world was loudly and coarsely defied to equal the
value of those overcoats. On the day of opening they arranged an
orchestra or artillery of phonographs upon the leads over the window of
that part of the shop which had been Mr. Critchlow's. They also
carpeted the Square with handbills, and flew flags from their upper
storeys. The immense shop proved to be full of overcoats; overcoats
were shown in all the three great windows; in one window an overcoat
was disposed as a receptacle for water, to prove that the Midland
twelve-and-sixpenny overcoats were impermeable by rain. Overcoats
flapped in the two doorways. These devices woke and drew the town, and
the town found itself received by bustling male assistants very
energetic and rapid, instead of by demure anaemic virgins. At moments
towards evening the shop was populous with custom; the number of
overcoats sold was prodigious. On another day the Midland sold trousers
in a like manner, but without the phonographs. Unmistakably the Midland
had shaken the Square and demonstrated that commerce was still possible
to fearless enterprise.

<p/>Nevertheless the Square was not pleased. The Square was conscious of
shame, of dignity departed. Constance was divided between pain and
scornful wrath. For her (<font color='blue'><b>assistants</b></font>), what the Midland had done was to desecrate a
shrine. She (<font color='blue'><b>assistants</b></font>) hated those flags, and those flaring, staring posters on
the honest old brick walls, and the enormous gilded sign, and the
windows all filled with a monotonous repetition of the same article,
and the bustling assistants. As for the phonographs, she (<font color='blue'><b>assistants</b></font>) regarded them
as a grave insult; they had been within twenty feet of her (<font color='blue'><b>assistants</b></font>) drawing-room
window! Twelve-and-sixpenny overcoats! It was monstrous, and equally
monstrous was the gullibility of the people. How could an overcoat at
twelve and sixpence be <div class="bookquote">``good.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) remembered the overcoats made and
sold in the shop in the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) father and her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) husband, overcoats
of which the inconvenience was that they would not wear out! The
Midland, for Constance, was not a trading concern, but something
between a cheap-jack and a circus. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) could scarcely bear to walk down
the Square, to such a degree did the ignoble frontage of the Midland
offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) eye and outrage her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) ancestral pride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) even said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>)
would give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) house.

<p/>But when, on the twenty-ninth of September, she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) received six months'
notice, signed in Critchlow's shaky hand, to quit the house--it was
wanted for the Midland's manager, the Midland having taken the premises
on condition that they might eject Constance if they chose--the blow
was an exceedingly severe one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had sworn to go--but to be turned
out, to be turned out of the house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) birth and out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) father's
home, that was different! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) pride, injured as it was, had a great
deal to support. It became necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) to recollect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was
a Baines. She (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) affected magnificently not to care. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) could not
refrain from telling all her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) acquaintances that she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) was being turned
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) house, and asking them what they thought of THAT; and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) met Charles Critchlow in the street she (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) seared him (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) with the heat of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) resentment. The enterprise of finding a new house and moving into
it loomed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) gigantic, terrible, the idea of it was alone
sufficient to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) ill.

<p/>Meanwhile, in the matter of Federation, preparations for the pitched
battle had been going forward, especially in the columns of the Signal,
where the scribes of each one of the Five Towns had proved that all the
other towns were in the clutch of unscrupulous gangs of self-seekers.
After months of argument and recrimination, all the towns except
Bursley were either favourable or indifferent to the prospect of
becoming a part of the twelfth largest town in the United Kingdom. But
in Bursley the opposition was strong, and the twelfth largest town in
the United Kingdom could not spring into existence without the consent
of Bursley. The United Kingdom itself was languidly interested in the
possibility of suddenly being endowed with a new town of a quarter of a
million inhabitants. The Five Towns were frequently mentioned in the
London dailies, and London journalists would write such sentences as:
<div class="bookquote">``The Five Towns, which are of course, as everybody knows, Hanbridge,
Bursley, Knype, Longshaw, and Turnhill...''  (<font color='red'><b>London journalists</b></font>)</div>This was renown at last,
for the most maligned district in the country! And then a Cabinet
Minister had visited the Five Towns, and assisted at an official
inquiry, and stated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) hammering style that he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) meant personally to
do everything possible to accomplish the Federation of the Five Towns:
an incautious remark, which infuriated, while it flattered, the
opponents of Federation in Bursley. Constance, with many other
sensitive persons, asked angrily what right a Cabinet Minister had to
take sides in a purely local affair. But the partiality of the official
world grew flagrant. The Mayor of Bursley openly proclaimed himself a
Federationist, though there was a majority on the Council against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>).
Even ministers of religion permitted themselves to think and to express
opinions. Well might the indignant Old Guard imagine that the end of
public decency had come! The Federationists were very ingenious
individuals. They contrived to enrol in their ranks a vast number of
leading men. Then they hired the Covered Market, and put a platform in
it, and put all these leading men on the platform, and made them all
speak eloquently on the advantages of moving with the times. The
meeting was crowded and enthusiastic, and readers of the Signal next
day could not but see that the battle was won in advance, and that
anti-Federation was dead. In the following week, however, the
anti-Federationists held in the Covered Market an exactly similar
meeting -LRB-except that the display of leading men was less brilliant-RRB-,
and demanded of a floor of serried heads whether the old Mother of the
Five Towns was prepared to put herself into the hands of a crew of
highly-paid bureaucrats at Hanbridge, and was answered by a wild
defiant <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>bureaucrats</b></font>)</div>that could be heard on Duck Bank. Readers of the Signal
next day were fain to see that the battle had not been won in advance.
Bursley was lukewarm on the topics of education, slums, water, gas,
electricity. But it meant to fight for that mysterious thing, its
identity. Was the name of Bursley to be lost to the world? To ask the
question was to give the answer.

<p/>Then dawned the day of battle, the day of the Poll, when the burgesses
were to indicate plainly by means of a cross on a voting paper whether
or not they wanted Federation. And on this day Constance was almost
incapacitated by sciatica. It was a heroic day. The walls of the town
were covered with literature, and the streets dotted with motor-cars
and other vehicles at the service of the voters. The greater number of
these vehicles bore large cards with the words, <div class="bookquote">``Federation this time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>hundreds</b></font>)</div>And hundreds of men walked briskly about with circular cards tied to
their lapels, as though Bursley had been a race-course, and these cards
too had the words, <div class="bookquote">``Federation this time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bursley/Bursley Town Silver Prize Band</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The reference was to a
light poll which had been taken several years before, when no interest
had been aroused and the immature project yet defeated by a six to one
majority.-RRB- All partisans of Federation sported a red ribbon; all
Anti-Federationists sported a blue ribbon. The schools were closed and
the Federationists displayed their characteristic lack of scruple in
appropriating the children. The Federationists, with devilish skill,
had hired the Bursley Town Silver Prize Band, an organization of
terrific respectability, and had set it to march playing through the
town followed by wagonettes crammed with children, who sang:

<p/>Vote, vote, vote for Federation, Don't be stupid, old and slow, We are
sure that it will be Good for the communitie, So vote, vote, vote, and
make it go.

<p/>How this performance could affect the decision of grave burgesses at
the polls was not apparent; but the Anti-Federationists feared that it
might, and before noon was come they had engaged two bands and had
composed in committee, the following lyric in reply to the first one:

<p/>Down, down, down, with Federation, As we are we'd rather stay; When the
vote on Saturday's read Federation will be dead, Good old Bursley's
sure to win the day.

<p/>They had also composed another song, entitled <div class="bookquote">``Dear old Bursley,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which, however, they made the fatal error of setting to the music of
<div class="bookquote">``Auld Lang Syne.''  (<font color='red'><b>voters</b></font>)</div>The effect was that of a dirge, and it perhaps
influenced many voters in favour of the more cheerful party. The
Anti-Federationists, indeed, never regained the mean advantage filched
by unscrupulous Federationists with the help of the Silver Prize Band
and a few hundred infants. The odds were against the
Anti-Federationists. The mayor had actually issued a letter to the
inhabitants accusing the Anti-Federationists of unfair methods! This
was really too much! The impudence of it knocked the breath out of its
victims, and breath is very necessary in a polling contest. The
Federationists, as one of their prominent opponents admitted, `had it
all their own way,'' dominating both the streets and the walls. And
when, early in the afternoon, Mr. Dick Povey sailed over the town in a
balloon that was plainly decorated with the crimson of Federation, it
was felt that the cause of Bursley's separate identity was for ever
lost. Still, Bursley, with the willing aid of the public-houses,
maintained its gaiety.

<p/>IV

<p/>Towards dusk a stout old lady, with grey hair, and a dowdy bonnet, and
an expensive mantle, passed limping, very slowly, along Wedgwood Street
and up the Cock Yard towards the Town Hall. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wrinkled face had an
anxious look, but it was also very determined. The busy, joyous
Federationists and Anti-Federationists who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) not saw merely a
stout old lady fussing forth, and those who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw merely Mrs.
Povey and greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) perfunctorily, a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age and gait being
rather out of place in that feverish altercation of opposed principles.
But it was more than a stout old lady, it was more than Mrs. Povey that
waddled with such painful deliberation through the streets--it was a
miracle.

<p/>In the morning Constance had been partially incapacitated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
sciatica; so much so, at any rate, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) had perceived the
advisability of remaining on the bedroom floor instead of descending to
the parlour. Therefore Mary had lighted the drawing-room fire, and
Constance had ensconced herself by it, with Fossette in a basket. Lily
Holl had called early, and had been very sympathetic, but rather vague.
The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) was concealing the imminent balloon ascent which
Dick Povey, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) instinct for the picturesque, had somehow
arranged, in conjunction with a well-known Manchester aeronaut, for the
very day of the poll. That was one of various matters that had to be
`kept from' the old lady. Lily herself was much perturbed about the
balloon ascent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had to run off and see Dick before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) started, at
the Football Ground at Bleakridge, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had to live through the
hours till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) should receive a telegram to the effect that Dick had
come down safely or that Dick had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) leg in coming down, or
that Dick was dead. It was a trying time for Lily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had left
Constance after a brief visit, with a preoccupied unusual air, saying
that as the day was a special day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) should come in again `if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
could.<div class="bookquote">'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) did not forget to assure Constance that Federation
would beyond any question whatever be handsomely beaten at the poll;
for this was another matter as to which it was deemed advisable to keep
the old lady `in the dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>lest the foolish old lady should worry and
commit indiscretions.

<p/>After that Constance had been forgotten by the world of Bursley, which
could pay small heed to sciatical old ladies confined to sofas and
firesides. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in acute pain, as Mary could see when at intervals
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hovered round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Assuredly it was one of Constance's bad days,
one of those days on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that the tide of life had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
stranded in utter neglect. The sound of the Bursley Town Silver Prize
Band aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mournful trance of suffering. Then the high
treble of children's voices startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) defied her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sciatica, and,
grimacing, went to the window. And at the first glimpse she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see
that the Federation Poll was going to be a much more exciting affair
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had imagined. The great cards swinging from the wagonettes
showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that Federation was at all events still sufficiently alive
to make a formidable impression on the eye and the ear. The Square was
transformed by this clamour in favour of Federation; people cheered,
and sang also, as the procession wound down the Square. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could
distinctly catch the tramping, martial syllables, <div class="bookquote">``Vote, vote, vote.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was indignant. The pother, once begun, continued. Vehicles flashed
frequently across the Square, most of them in the crimson livery.
Little knots and processions of excited wayfarers were a recurring
feature of the unaccustomed traffic, and the large majority of them
flaunted the colours of Federation. Mary, after some errands of
shopping, came upstairs and reported that `it was simply <div class="bookquote">``Federation''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>everywhere,'' and that Mr. Brindley, a strong Federationist, was `above
a bit above himself'; further, that the interest in the poll was
tremendous and universal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said there were `crowds and crowds' round
the Town Hall. Even Mary, generally a little placid and dull, had
caught something of the contagious vivacity.

<p/>Constance remained at the window till dinner, and after dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went
to it again. It was fortunate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not think of looking up into
the sky when Dick's balloon sailed westwards; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have guessed
instantly that Dick was in that balloon, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) grievances would have
been multiplied. The vast grievance of the Federation scheme weighed on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to the extremity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) power to bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not a politician;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no general ideas; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not see the cosmic movement in large
curves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was incapable of perceiving the absurdity involved in
perpetuating municipal divisions which the growth of the district had
rendered artificial, vexatious, and harmful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw nothing but
Bursley, and in Bursley nothing but the Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew nothing except
that the people of Bursley, who once shopped in Bursley, now shopped in
Hanbridge, and that the Square was a desert infested by cheap-jacks.
And there were actually people who wished to bow the neck to Hanbridge,
who were ready to sacrifice the very name of Bursley to the greedy
humour of that pushing Chicago! She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not understand such people.
Did they know that poor Maria Critchlow was in a lunatic asylum because
Hanbridge was so grasping? Ah, poor Maria was al-ready forgotten! Did
they know that, as a further indirect consequence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), the daughter of
Bursley's chief tradesman, was to be thrown out of the house in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was born? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wished, bitterly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) stood there at the window,
watching the triumph of Federation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had bought the house and
shop at the Mericarp sale years ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would have shown them, as
owner, what was what! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) forgot that the property which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) already
owned in Bursley was a continual annoyance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
always resolving to sell it at no matter what loss.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had a vote, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been `at
all fit to stir out' she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would certainly have voted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said to
herself that it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) duty to vote. And then by an illusion of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wrought nerves, tightened minute by minute throughout the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
began to fancy that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sciatica was easier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``If only I could
go out!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might have a cab, of any of the parading vehicles would be
glad to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to the Town Hall, and, perhaps, as a favour, to bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) back again. But no! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) dared not go out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was afraid, really
afraid that even the mild Mary might stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Otherwise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could
have sent Mary for a cab. And supposing that Lily returned, and caught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) going out or coming in! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) ought not to go out. Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sciatica
was strangely better. It was folly to think of going out. Yet...! And
Lily did not come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was rather hurt that Lily had not paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) a
second visit. Lily was neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)... She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would go out. It was not
four minutes' walk for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to the Town Hall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was better. And
there had been no shower for a long time, and the wind was drying the
mud in the roadways. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would go.

<p/>Like a thief she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) passed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) bedroom and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) things; and
like a thief she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) crept downstairs, and so, without a word to Mary, into
the street. It was a desperate adventure. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in the
street she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) weakness, all the fatigue which the effort had
already cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). The pain returned. The streets were still wet and
foul, the wind cold, and the sky menacing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to go back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
ought to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been a fool to dream of the enterprise. The
Town Hall seemed to be miles off, at the top of a mountain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went
forward, however, steeled to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) share in the killing of Federation.
Every step caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a gnashing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) old teeth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chose the Cock
Yard route, because if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone up the Square she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have had to
pass Holl's shop, and Lily might have spied her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).

<p/>This was the miracle that breezy politicians witnessed without being
aware that it was a miracle. To have impressed them, Constance ought to
have fainted before recording her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) vote, and made herself the centre of
a crowd of gapers. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) managed, somehow, to reach home again on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
own tortured feet, and an astounded and protesting Mary opened the door
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Rain was descending. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was frightened, then, by the hardihood
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) adventure, and by its atrocious results on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) body. An
appalling exhaustion rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) helpless. But the deed was done.

<p/>V

<p/>The next morning, after a night which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not have described,
Constance found herself lying flat in bed, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) limbs stretched
out straight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was conscious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face was covered with
perspiration. The bell-rope hung within a foot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
decided that, rather than move in order to pull it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would prefer to
wait for assistance until Mary came of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own accord. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) experiences
of the night had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a dread of the slightest movement; anything
was better than movement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt vaguely ill, with a kind of subdued
pain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very thirsty and somewhat cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
left arm and leg were extraordinarily tender to the touch. When Mary at
length entered, clean and fresh and pale in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mildness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found
the mistress the colour of a duck's egg, with puffed features, and a
strangely anxious expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, <div class="bookquote">``I feel so queer. Perhaps you'd better run up
and tell Miss Holl, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) to telephone for Dr. Stirling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the beginning of Constance's last illness. Mary most
impressively informed Miss Holl that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mistress had been out on the
previous afternoon in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sciatica, and Lily telephoned the
fact to the Doctor. Lily then came down to take charge of Constance.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) dared not upbraid the invalid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the result out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>Constance murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily, lightly. <div class="bookquote">``There's a majority of over twelve
hundred against Federation. Great excitement last night! I told you
yesterday morning that Federation was bound to be beaten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div><p/>Lily spoke as though the result throughout had been a certainty; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
tone to Constance indicated: <div class="bookquote">``Surely you don't imagine that I should
have told you untruths yesterday morning merely to cheer you up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>The
truth was, however, that towards the end of the day nearly every one
had believed Federation to be carried. The result had caused great
surprise. Only the profoundest philosophers had not been surprised to
see that the mere blind, deaf, inert forces of reaction, with faulty
organization, and quite deprived of the aid of logic, had proved far
stronger than all the alert enthusiasm arrayed against them. It was a
notable lesson to reformers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>murmured Constance, startled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was relieved; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would
have liked the majority to be smaller. Moreover, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) interest in the
question had lessened. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) limbs that pre-occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) said feebly to Lily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily/Lily Holl/Holl</b></font>)</div>said Lily, shortly, hiding the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had spent half the
night in tending Dick Povey, who, in a sensational descent near
Macclesfield, had been dragged through the tops of a row of elm trees
to the detriment of an elbow-joint; the professional aeronaut had
broken a leg.

<p/>Then Dr. Stirling came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid my sciatica's worse, Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance,
apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you expect it to be better?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>), gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sternly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
knew then that some one had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) the trouble of confessing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
escapade.

<p/>However, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sciatica was not worse. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sciatica had not behaved
basely. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was suffering from was the preliminary advances of an
attack of acute rheumatism. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had indeed selected the right month and
weather for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) escapade! Fatigued by pain, by nervous agitation, and
by the immense moral and physical effort needed to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to the
Town Hall and back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had caught a chill, and had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) feet damp.
In such a subject as herself it was enough. The doctor used only the
phrase `acute rheumatism.'' Constance did not know that acute rheumatism
was precisely the same thing as that dread disease, rheumatic fever,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was not informed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) did not surmise for a considerable period
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) case was desperately serious. The doctor explained the
summoning of two nurses, and the frequency of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own visits, by saying
that his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) chief anxiety was to minimise the fearful pain as much as
possible, and that this end could only be secured by incessant
watchfulness. The pain was certainly formidable. But then Constance was
well habituated to formidable pain. Sciatica, at its most active,
cannot be surpassed even by rheumatic fever. Constance had been in
nearly continuous pain for years. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) friends, however sympathetic,
could not appreciate the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) torture. They were just as
used to it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was. And the monotony and particularity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
complaints -LRB-slight though the complaints were in comparison with their
cause-RRB- necessarily blunted the edge of compassion. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Povey and her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>)
sciatica again! Poor thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) really is a little tedious!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were
apt not to realise that sciatica is even more tedious than complaints
about sciatica.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) asked one day that Dick should come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) came with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
arm in a sling, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) charily that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) elbow through
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) stick and slipping downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lily never told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance, suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's simply nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Povey</b></font>)</div>said Dick. Not even the sick room could
chasten him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) joy in the magnificent balloon adventure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope you won't go running any risks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Constance/Povey/Constance Povey</b></font>)</div>said Constance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you fear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall die in my bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) was absolutely convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) would, and not as the result of
any accident, either! The nurse would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) to remain in the
room.

<p/>Lily suggested that Constance might like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to write to Cyril. It was
only in order to make sure of Cyril's correct address. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had gone on a
tour through Italy with some friends of whom Constance knew nothing.
The address appeared to be very uncertain; there were several
addresses, poste restante in various towns. Cyril had sent postcards to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) mother. Dick and Lily went to the post-office and telegraphed to
foreign parts. Though Constance was too ill to know how ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had no conception of the domestic confusion caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
illness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) brain was often remarkably clear, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) could reflect in
long, sane meditations above the uneasy sea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) pain. In the earlier
hours of the night, after the nurses had been changed, and Mary had
gone to bed exhausted with stair-climbing, and Lily Holl was recounting
the day to Dick up at the grocer's, and the day-nurse was already
asleep, and the night-nurse had arranged the night, then, in the
faintly-lit silence of the chamber, Constance would argue with herself
for an hour at a time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Holl</b></font>) frequently thought of Sophia. In spite of
the fact that Sophia was dead she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) still pitied Sophia as a woman whose
life had been wasted. This idea of Sophia's wasted and sterile life,
and of the far-reaching importance of adhering to principles, recurred
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) again and again. <div class="bookquote">``Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) run away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)? If only she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had
not run away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would repeat. And yet there had been something so
fine about Sophia! Which made Sophia's case all the more pitiable!
Constance never pitied herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not consider that Fate had
treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) very badly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not very discontented with herself. The
invincible commonsense of a sound nature prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) best
moments, from feebly dissolving in self-pity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had lived in honesty
and kindliness for a fair number of years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had tasted
triumphant hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was justly respected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had a position, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had
dignity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was well-off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) possessed, after all, a certain amount
of quiet self-conceit. There existed nobody to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would `knuckle
down,<div class="bookquote">'' or could be asked to `knuckle down.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>True, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was old! So were
thousands of other people in Bursley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was in pain. So there were
thousands of other people. With whom would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) be willing to exchange
lots? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had many dissatisfactions. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) rose superior to them.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) life, and life in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) would think, with
a sort of tart but not sour cheerfulness: <div class="bookquote">``Well, that is what life is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) habit of complaining about domestic trifles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was, in
the essence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) character, 'a great body for making the best of
things.'' Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not unduly bewail her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) excursion to the Town Hall
to vote, which the sequel had proved to be ludicrously supererogatory.
<div class="bookquote">``How was I to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said.

<p/>The one matter in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had gravely to reproach herself was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
indulgent spoiling of Cyril after the death of Samuel Povey. But the
end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) reproaches always was: <div class="bookquote">``I expect I should do the same again!
And probably it wouldn't have made any difference if I hadn't spoiled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had paid tenfold for the weakness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) loved Cyril, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had no illusions about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) saw both sides of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
remembered all the sadness and all the humiliations which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Still, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) affection was unimpaired. A son might be worse than
Cyril was; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had admirable qualities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) did not resent his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) being
away from England while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lay ill. <div class="bookquote">``If it was serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
would not lose a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And Lily and Dick were a treasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). In
those two she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) really had been lucky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) took great pleasure in
contemplating the splendour of the gift with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would mark her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
appreciation of them at their approaching wedding. The secret attitude
of both of them towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was one of good-natured condescension,
expressed in the tone in which they would say to each other, `the old
lady.'' Perhaps they would have been startled to know that Constance
lovingly looked down on both of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had unbounded admiration for
their hearts; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought that Dick was a little too brusque, a
little too clownish, to be quite a gentleman. And though Lily was
perfectly ladylike, in Constance's opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) lacked backbone, or
grit, or independence of spirit. Further, Constance considered that the
disparity of age between them was excessive. It is to be doubted
whether, when all was said, Constance had such a very great deal to
learn from the self-confident wisdom of these young things.

<p/>After a period of self-communion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would sometimes fall into a
shallow delirium. In all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) delirium she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was invariably wandering to
and fro, lost, in the long underground passage leading from the
scullery past the coal-cellar and the cinder-cellar to the backyard.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was afraid of the vast-obscure of those regions, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had
been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) infancy.

<p/>It was not acute rheumatism, but a supervening pericarditis that in a
few days killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) died in the night, alone with the night-nurse.
By a curious chance the Wesleyan minister, hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was
seriously ill, had called on the previous day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had not asked for
him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>); and this pastoral visit, from a man who had always said that the
heavy duties of the circuit rendered pastoral visits almost impossible,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) think. In the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had requested that Fossette should
be brought upstairs.

<p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was turned out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) house, but not by the Midland Clothiers
Company. Old people said to one another: <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard that Mrs.
Povey is dead? Eh, dear me! There'll be no one left soon.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>These old
people were bad prophets. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) friends genuinely regretted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>), and
forgot the tediousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sciatica. They tried, in their
sympathetic grief, to picture to themselves all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had been
through in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) life. Possibly they imagined that they succeeded in this
imaginative attempt. But they did not succeed. No one but Constance
could realize all that Constance had been through, and all that life
had meant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).

<p/>Cyril was not at the funeral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) arrived three days later. -LRB-As he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyril</b></font>) had
no interest in the love affairs of Dick and Lily, the couple were
robbed of their wedding-present. The will, fifteen years old, was in
Cyril's favour.-RRB- But the immortal Charles Critchlow came to the
funeral, full of calm, sardonic glee, and without being asked. Though
fabulously senile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) had preserved and even improved his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) faculty for
enjoying a catastrophe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) now went to funerals with gusto, contentedly
absorbed in the task of burying his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) friends one by one. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) who
said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Critchlow</b></font>) high, trembling, rasping, deliberate voice: <div class="bookquote">``It's a pity
her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>) didn't live long enough to hear as Federation is going on after
all! That would ha' worritted her (<font color='blue'><b>Povey</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-For the unscrupulous advocates of
Federation had discovered a method of setting at naught the decisive
result of the referendum, and that day's Signal was fuller than ever of
Federation.-RRB-

<p/>When the short funeral procession started, Mary and the infirm Fossette
-LRB-sole relic of the connection between the Baines family and Paris-RRB- were
left alone in the house. The tearful servant prepared the dog's dinner
and laid it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) in the customary soup-plate in the customary
corner. Fossette sniffed at it, and then walked away and lay down with
a dog's sigh in front of the kitchen fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) had been deranged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
habits that day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was conscious of neglect, due to events which
passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) comprehension. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) did not like it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) was hurt, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) appetite was hurt. However, after a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) began to
reconsider the matter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) glanced at the soup-plate, and, on the
chance that it might after all contain something worth inspection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>)
awkwardly balanced herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baines</b></font>) old legs and went to it again.
