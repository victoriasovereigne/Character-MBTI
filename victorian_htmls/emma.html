<p/>By Jane Austen




<p/>VOLUME I



<p/>CHAPTER I


<p/>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home
and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very
little to distress or vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,
indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) sister's marriage, been
mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house from a very early period. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mother had died
too long ago for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to have more than an indistinct remembrance of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) caresses; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) place had been supplied by an excellent woman as
governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.

<p/>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a
governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly
of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before
Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the
mildness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) temper had hardly allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) to impose any restraint;
and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been
living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma
doing just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but
directed chiefly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own.

<p/>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having
rather too much her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own way, and a disposition to think a little too
well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,
that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any
disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's
loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this
beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any
continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father and
herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer
a long evening. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as
usual, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had then only to sit and think of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had lost.

<p/>The event had every promise of happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend. Mr. Weston
was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and
pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering
with what self-denying, generous friendship she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had always wished and
promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The want
of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had
taught and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) from five years old--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had
devoted all her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) powers to attach and amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in health--and how
nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of
gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven
years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed
Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a
dearer, tenderer recollection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had been a friend and companion such
as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing
all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and
peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of
hers--one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could speak every thought as it arose, and who had
such an affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) as could never find fault.

<p/>How was she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to bear the change?--It was true that her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend was going
only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the
difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss
Taylor in the house; and with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) advantages, natural and domestic,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
dearly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was no companion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in conversation, rational or playful.

<p/>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages -LRB-and Mr. Woodhouse had
not married early-RRB- was much increased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) constitution and habits;
for having been a valetudinarian all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life, without activity of
mind or body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was a much older man in ways than in years; and though
everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) heart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) amiable
temper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) talents could not have recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at any time.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being
settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) daily
reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled
through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from
Isabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) husband, and their little children, to fill the house,
and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) pleasant society again.

<p/>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,
to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and
name, did really belong, afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) no equals. The Woodhouses
were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had many
acquaintance in the place, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father was universally civil, but
not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even
half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over
it, and wish for impossible things, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father awoke, and made it
necessary to be cheerful. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spirits required support. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a nervous
man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was used to, and
hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the
origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was by no means yet
reconciled to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that
other people could feel differently from himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very much
disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for
them, and would have been a great deal happier if she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had spent all the
rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was
impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not to say exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said at dinner,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) were here again. What a pity it is that
Mr. Weston ever thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such
a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thoroughly deserves
a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for
ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) might have a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own?
This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my
dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We
shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding
visit very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could
not walk half so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,
to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a
little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our
visit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have
settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last
night. And as for James, you may be very sure he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will always like going
to Randalls, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter's being housemaid there. I only
doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,
papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you
mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)--James is so obliged to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad I did think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>). It was very lucky, for I would not
have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am
sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) will make a very good servant: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) is a civil, pretty-spoken
girl; I have a great opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>). Whenever I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) always
curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you
have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) here to do needlework, I observe she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) always turns the lock
of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) will be an
excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor
to have somebody about her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is used to see. Whenever James goes
over to see his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter, you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will be hearing of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will
be able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) how we all are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and
hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father tolerably
through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own. The
backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked
in and made it unnecessary.

<p/>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not
only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly
connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived
about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,
and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their
mutual connexions in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had returned to a late dinner, after
some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were
well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated
Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which
always did him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) many inquiries after <div class="bookquote">``poor Isabella''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and
her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.
Woodhouse gratefully observed, <div class="bookquote">``It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,
to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have
had a shocking walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I
must draw back from your great fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not
catch cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain
here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at
breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what
sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my
congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you
all behave? Who cried most?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor Miss Taylor! `Tis a sad business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say
`poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it
comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it
must be better to have only one to please than two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome
creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma playfully. <div class="bookquote">``That is what you have in your head, I
know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, with a
sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.
Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only
myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a
joke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults
in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) of them: and
though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew
it would be so much less so to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
really suspect such a circumstance as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not being thought perfect by
every body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma knows I never flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``but I meant no
reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons
to please; she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will now have but one. The chances are that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) must be a
gainer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, willing to let it pass--<div class="bookquote">``you want to hear about
the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved
charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not
a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we
were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Emma bears every thing so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``But, Mr.
Knightley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am
sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) _will_ miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) thinks for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, divided between tears and smiles. <div class="bookquote">``It
is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Knightley. <div class="bookquote">``We should not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so well as we do, sir, if we could
suppose it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's
advantage; she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's
time of life, to be settled in a home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own, and how important to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow
herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor
must be glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) so happily married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``and a very
considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you
know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the
right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may
comfort me for any thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father fondly replied, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for
whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more
matches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>``I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for
other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such
success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry
again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who
seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied
either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) business in town or among his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friends here, always
acceptable wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spend
a single evening in the year alone if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not like it. Oh no! Mr.
Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a
promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) deathbed, and others of the son and the
uncle not letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the
subject, but I believed none of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) darted
away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from
Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match
from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,
dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I do not understand what you mean by `success,''' said Mr. Knightley.
<div class="bookquote">``Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately
spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring
about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But
if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means
only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, `I think it
would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>),' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why
do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You
made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I
pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is
never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my
poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so
entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;
but I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and
the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given
many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might
not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield

man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER II


<p/>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had received a good education, but, on
succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed
for any of the more homely pursuits in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) brothers were engaged,
and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering
into the militia of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) county, then embodied.

<p/>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
military life had introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire
family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), nobody was surprized,
except her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, who had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and who were
full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.

<p/>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
fortune--though her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was
not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the
infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) off with
due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much
happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had a
husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) think every thing due
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in return for the great goodness of being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>);
but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had one sort of spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not the best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had
resolution enough to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own will in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) brother,
but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's
unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) former home.
They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison
of Enscombe: she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not cease to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wanted at
once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.

<p/>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,
as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of
the bargain; for when his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife died, after a three years' marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.
From the expense of the child, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was soon relieved. The boy
had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.
Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature
of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the
little Frank soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) decease. Some scruples and some reluctance
the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were
overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and
the wealth of the Churchills, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had only his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own comfort to seek,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own situation to improve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could.

<p/>A complete change of life became desirable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) quitted the militia and
engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in
London, which afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) a favourable opening. It was a concern which
brought just employment enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had still a small house in Highbury,
where most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation
and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
life passed cheerfully away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had, by that time, realised an easy
competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining
Highbury, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as
portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own friendly and social disposition.

<p/>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,
it had not shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) determination of never settling till he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could
purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were
accomplished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) fortune, bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) house, and obtained
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every
probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had
never been an unhappy man; his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own temper had secured him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) from that,
even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) first marriage; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) second must shew him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) how delightful
a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) the
pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be
chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had only himself to please in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) choice: his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) fortune was his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own;
for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) assume
the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should ever want his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's assistance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father had no
apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that
any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
believed, so deservedly dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son every year in London, and
was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fond report of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as a very fine young man
had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looked on as
sufficiently belonging to the place to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) merits and prospects a
kind of common concern.

<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively
curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) prevailed, though the compliment was so little
returned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never been there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming to visit
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father had been often talked of but never achieved.

<p/>Now, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a
most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a
dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with
Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now
was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope
strengthened when it was understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) new
mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury
included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill
has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,
indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) never saw such a handsome letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,
formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great good sense, and a most
welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) marriage had already secured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt herself a most
fortunate woman; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had lived long enough to know how fortunate
she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial
separation from friends whose friendship for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had never cooled, and
who could ill bear to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew that at times she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be missed; and could not think, without
pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,
from the want of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble
character; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation than most girls would
have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped
would bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) well and happily through its little difficulties and
privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of
Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,
and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the
approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in
the week together.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.
Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) satisfaction--her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) more
than satisfaction--her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,
that Emma, well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, was sometimes taken by surprize
at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being still able to pity `poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) go away
in the evening attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) pleasant husband to a carriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
own. But never did she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,
and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) would be very glad to stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to
pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>); but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.
The compliments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) neighbours were over; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was no longer teased by
being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which
had been a great distress to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), was all eat up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own stomach
could bear nothing rich, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could never believe other people to be
different from himself. What was unwholesome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) regarded as unfit
for any body; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them
from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as
earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been at the
pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry
was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one
of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
could not but acknowledge -LRB-though it seemed rather against the bias
of inclination-RRB- that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with
many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an
opinion, in confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence
every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;
and there was no rest for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) benevolent nerves till it was all gone.

<p/>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being
seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.
Woodhouse would never believe it.



<p/>CHAPTER III


<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked very much to
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friends come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and from various united causes, from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) long residence at Hartfield, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) good nature, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fortune,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could command the visits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
own little circle, in a great measure, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not much
intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) horror of late
hours, and large dinner-parties, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) unfit for any acquaintance but
such as would visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own terms. Fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), Highbury,
including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish
adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not
unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had some of the chosen and
the best to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>): but evening parties were what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) preferred;
and, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there
was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a
card-table for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).

<p/>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by
Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege
of exchanging any vacant evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own blank solitude for the
elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.

<p/>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were
Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at
the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and
carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for
either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it
would have been a grievance.

<p/>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old
lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the
regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward
circumstances, can excite. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree
of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.
Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having
much of the public favour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had no intellectual superiority to
make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) into
outward respect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
youth had passed without distinction, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) middle of life was devoted
to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small
income go as far as possible. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was a happy woman, and a woman
whom no one named without good-will. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own universal good-will
and contented temper which worked such wonders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) loved every body,
was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's
merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with
blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours
and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and
cheerfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nature, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) contented and grateful spirit, were a
recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,
full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.

<p/>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an
establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of
refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,
upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous
pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,
honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of
accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might
be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little
education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's
school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was
reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had an ample house and garden,
gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great
deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own
hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who
had worked hard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) youth, and now thought herself entitled to the
occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.
Woodhouse's kindness, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) particular claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) neat
parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) could, and win or lose
a few sixpences by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fireside.

<p/>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to
collect; and happy was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's sake, in the power; though,
as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of
Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father look comfortable, and
very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the
quiet prosings of three such women made her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) feel that every evening so
spent was indeed one of the long evenings she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had fearfully anticipated.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the
present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most
respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); a most
welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew
very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no
longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.

<p/>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody
had lately raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) from the condition of scholar to that of
parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) history.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and
was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young
ladies who had been at school there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was a very pretty girl, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) beauty happened to be of a sort
which Emma particularly admired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was short, plump, and fair, with a
fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great
sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manners as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person, and quite determined to continue the
acquaintance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's
conversation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) altogether very engaging--not
inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,
shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly
grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed
by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had
been used to, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.
Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those
natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury
and its connexions. The acquaintance she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had already formed were
unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). The friends from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had just parted, though very
good sort of people, must be doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) harm. They were a family of the
name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large
farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very
creditably, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of
them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the
intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance
to be quite perfect. _She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ would notice her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would improve her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would detach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bad acquaintance, and introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into good
society; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would form her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) opinions and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manners. It would be an
interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
own situation in life, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) leisure, and powers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and
listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the
evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which
always closed such parties, and for which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been used to sit and
watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the
fire, before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse
of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every
thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted
with its own ideas, did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) then do all the honours of the meal, and
help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an
urgency which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil
scruples of their guests.

<p/>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
youth, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hospitality would
have welcomed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) visitors to every thing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) care for their health
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) grieve that they would eat.

<p/>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could,
with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might constrain
himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to
say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg
boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg
better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body
else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of
our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a
_little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You
need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the
custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A
_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could
disagree with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father to talk--but supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visitors in a much
more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular
pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was
quite equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage
in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much
panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with
highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss
Woodhouse had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) all the evening, and actually shaken hands
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at last!



<p/>CHAPTER IV


<p/>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick
and decided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so
did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had
very early foreseen how useful she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). In that respect
Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father never went beyond the
shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) long
walk, or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage
her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) exercise had been too much confined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had ventured once alone to
Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,
one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable
addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) privileges. But in every respect, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) saw more of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) approved her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and was confirmed in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) kind designs.

<p/>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had a sweet, docile, grateful
disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be
guided by any one she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked up to. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) early attachment to herself
was very amiable; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inclination for good company, and power of
appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no
want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.
Altogether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the
young friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) wanted--exactly the something which her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) home required.
Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could
never be granted. Two such she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not want. It was quite a different
sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the
object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet
would be loved as one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there
was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who
were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was ready to tell
every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma
was obliged to fancy what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never believe that in
the same situation _she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet
had no penetration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been satisfied to hear and believe just what
Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and looked no farther.

<p/>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of
the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the
conversation--and but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) acquaintance with the Martins of
Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) thoughts a good deal; she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had spent two very happy months with them,
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) visit, and describe
the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much
exultation of Mrs. Martin's having <div class="bookquote">``_two_ parlours, two very good
parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's
drawing-room; and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) having an upper maid who had lived
five-and-twenty years with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and of their having eight cows, two of
them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch
cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so fond of it,
it should be called _her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)_ cow; and of their having a very handsome
summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to
drink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Martin/Mrs. Robert Martin</b></font>)</div><p/>For some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate
cause; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to understand the family better, other feelings
arose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and
daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it
appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was
always mentioned with approbation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) great good-nature in doing
something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.
Martin, no wife in the case; she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did suspect danger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) poor little
friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) were not
taken care of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might be required to sink herself forever.

<p/>With this inspiriting notion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) questions increased in number and
meaning; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,
and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to
speak of the share he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening
games; and dwelt a good deal upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) being so very good-humoured and
obliging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
some walnuts, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had said how fond she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was of them, and in
every thing else he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so very obliging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shepherd's son into
the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very fond
of singing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could sing a little himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was very
clever, and understood every thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had a very fine flock, and, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had been bid more for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wool than any body in
the country. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed every body spoke well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mother and
sisters were very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). Mrs. Martin had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) one day -LRB-and
there was a blush as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said it,-RRB- that it was impossible for any body
to be a better son, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was sure, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) married, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
would make a good husband. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) _wanted_ him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to marry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was
in no hurry at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Mrs. Martin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>thought Emma. <div class="bookquote">``You know what you are about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send
Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever
seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three
teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own business? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does not read?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has read a
good deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) reads the
Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window
seats--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an evening,
before we went to cards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would read something aloud out of the
Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has read the Vicar of
Wakefield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of
the Abbey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is determined to get them now as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next question was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) very plain at
first, but I do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) so plain now. One does not, you know,
after a time. But did you never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is in Highbury every now and
then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is sure to ride through every week in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) way to Kingston.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has passed you very often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be, and I may have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fifty times, but without having
any idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,
is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are
precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.
A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me;
I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But
a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as
much above my notice as in every other he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is below it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>);
but he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) being a very respectable young man. I know,
indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is so, and, as such, wish him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) well. What do you imagine
his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) age to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the
23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mother is
perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they
are, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were to take any pains to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would probably
repent it. Six years hence, if he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could meet with a good sort of young
woman in the same rank as his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own, with a little money, it might be very
desirable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would be thirty years old!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not
born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fortune entirely
to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
might come into when his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) father died, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) share of the family
property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stock, and
so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) may be rich in
time, it is next to impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) should have realised any thing
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no
indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks
of taking a boy another year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does
marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife--for though his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected
to, it does not follow that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might marry any body at all fit for you
to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a
gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by
every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who
would take pleasure in degrading you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,
and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any
body can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would
have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent
even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently
well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd
acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still
be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn
in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife,
who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body
but what had had some education--and been very well brought up. However,
I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shall
not wish for the acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife. I shall always have a great
regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very
sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But
if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not
visit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), if I can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no
alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious
difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
own.

<p/>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the
Donwell road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) companion. Emma was
not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few
yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quick eye
sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) appearance was very
neat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) looked like a sensible young man, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) person had no
other advantage; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to be contrasted with gentlemen,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) must lose all the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had gained in Harriet's
inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had voluntarily
noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.
Martin looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not know what manner was.

<p/>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be
kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with a smiling face,
and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to
compose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only think of our happening to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)!--How very odd! It was quite
a chance, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had not gone round by Randalls. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did not
think we ever walked this road. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thought we walked towards Randalls
most days. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was so busy the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was at Kingston that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) quite forgot it,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well,
Miss Woodhouse, is he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) like what you expected? What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)?
Do you think him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) so very plain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing
compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect
much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could be so
very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), I confess, a
degree or two nearer gentility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, in a mortified voice, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is not so genteel
as real gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you
must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield,
you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I
should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company
with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to be a very inferior
creature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not
you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) awkward look and
abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly
unmodulated as I stood here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is not like Mr. Knightley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has not such a fine air and
way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But
Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to
compare Mr. Martin with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)_. You might not see one in a hundred with
_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not the
only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston
and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their
manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.
You must see the difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old
man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) good manners the more valuable. The older a person
grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not
be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or
awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later
age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) be at Mr.
Weston's time of life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no saying, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Harriet rather solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there may be pretty good guessing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be a completely gross,
vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of
nothing but profit and loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), indeed? That will be very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) business engrosses him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) already is very plain from the
circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing
else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
do with books? And I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _will_ thrive, and be a very
rich man in time--and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being illiterate and coarse need not disturb

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not remember the book'' (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>--was all Harriet's answer, and
spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be
safely left to itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), therefore, said no more for some time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
next beginning was,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.

more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,
almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)_,
because there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to
be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding
sort of manner, though it suits _him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)_ very well; his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) figure, and look,
and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set
about copying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think
a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a
model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,
Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manners are
softer than they used to be. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) means any thing, it must be to please
you. Did not I tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) said of you the other day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) then repeated some warm personal praise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had drawn from Mr.
Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.

<p/>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young
farmer out of Harriet's head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought it would be an excellent
match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
to have much merit in planning it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feared it was what every body
else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any
body should have equalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the date of the plan, as it had
entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to
Hartfield. The longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered it, the greater was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sense
of its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the
gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of
any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had a comfortable home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and Emma imagined a very sufficient
income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was known
to have some independent property; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought very highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any
deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had already satisfied herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought Harriet a beautiful
girl, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was
foundation enough on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side; and on Harriet's there could be little
doubt that the idea of being preferred by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have all the usual
weight and efficacy. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was really a very pleasing young man, a
young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was reckoned very
handsome; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person much admired in general, though not by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
there being a want of elegance of feature which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not dispense
with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding
about the country to get walnuts for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might very well be conquered by
Mr. Elton's admiration.



<p/>CHAPTER V


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I
think it a bad thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they will neither of them do the other any good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with a
new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been
seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently
we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This will
certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.
Knightley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing
Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) were here, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks
exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday,
and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a
girl in Highbury for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not
allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live
alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no
man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sex, after being used to it all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life. I can imagine
your objection to Harriet Smith. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not the superior young woman
which Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) better informed, it will be an inducement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to read more
herself. They will read together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) means it, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was twelve years old.
I have seen a great many lists of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drawing-up at various times of
books that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to read regularly through--and very good lists
they were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes
alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drew
up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judgment so much
credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) may have made
out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of
steady reading from Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will never submit to any thing
requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the
understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely
affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that I thought so
_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting
to do any thing I wished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>--said
Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had done. <div class="bookquote">``But I,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon added, <div class="bookquote">``who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must
still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family. At ten years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the misfortune of being able to
answer questions which puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister at seventeen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was always
quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lost the only person able to cope with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) inherits her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_
recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another
situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to
any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You are better placed _here_; very fit for a
wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to
be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might
not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to
promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_, on the
very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing
as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a wife, I
should certainly have named Miss Taylor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to
such a man as Mr. Weston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that
with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We
will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of
comfort, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son may plague him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not _that_.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not
foretell vexation from that quarter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's
genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the
young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But
Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) the
very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knows
nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a
flatterer in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has any
thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful
inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)_ cannot
gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) out of conceit
with all the other places she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) belongs to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) will grow just refined
enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances
have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any
strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally
to the varieties of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation in life.--They only give a little
polish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more
anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.
How well she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked last night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you would rather talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, would you? Very
well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect
beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom
seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial
old friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,
open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,
and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
There is health, not merely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bloom, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) air, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
glance. One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture of health;'
now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of
grown-up health. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not a fault to find with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
all you describe. I love to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and I will add this praise,
that I do not think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) personally vain. Considering how very handsome
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) appears to be little occupied with it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) vanity lies
another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of
Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not
doing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is an
excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder
sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has qualities which may be
trusted; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will never lead any one really wrong; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will make no
lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is in the right a hundred
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and
I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection,
and Isabella always thinks as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does; except when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is not quite
frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that you all love her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) really too well to be unjust or unkind;
but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty -LRB-I consider myself,
you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's
mother might have had-RRB- the liberty of hinting that I do not think any
possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a
matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any
little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be
expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, who perfectly
approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a
source of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to
give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little
remains of office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for it. It is very
good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often
found; for it shall be attended to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my
ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella
does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;
perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one
feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston gently, <div class="bookquote">``very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) always declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will never marry, which, of course, means just
nothing at all. But I have no idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has yet ever seen a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be very much in love
with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some
doubt of a return; it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good. But there is nobody hereabouts
to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) goes so seldom from home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolution
at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``as can well be; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is so
happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be forming any attachment which
would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I
do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight
to the state, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own
and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes
at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to
have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon
afterwards made to <div class="bookquote">``What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have
rain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had nothing more to say or surmise about
Hartfield.



<p/>CHAPTER VI


<p/>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper
direction and raised the gratitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) young vanity to a very good
purpose, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.
Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
admiration by agreeable hints, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was soon pretty confident of creating
as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of
falling in love, if not in love already. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no scruple with regard
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) talked of Harriet, and praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so warmly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) growing attachment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have given Miss Smith all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) required,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you have
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) graceful and easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was a beautiful creature when she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are
infinitely superior to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) received from nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you think I have been useful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); but Harriet only wanted
drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had all the
natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have
done very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were admissible to contradict a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>said the gallant Mr.
Elton--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have perhaps given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little more decision of character, have
taught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to think on points which had not fallen in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded
decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition
more truly amiable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>And it was spoken with a sort of sighing
animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not less pleased
another day with the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) seconded a sudden wish of hers,
to have Harriet's picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``did you
ever sit for your picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,
with a very interesting naivete,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, no, never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>No sooner was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an exquisite possession a good picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be! I would
give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) likeness myself.
You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great
passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and
was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or
another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,
if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
picture!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me entreat you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Elton; <div class="bookquote">``it would indeed be a delight!
Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent
in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could
you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your
landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable
figure-pieces in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) drawing-room, at Randalls?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking
likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in raptures
about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if you give me
such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.
Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult;
and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines
about the mouth which one ought to catch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have
not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,
it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thinks
so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own beauty. Did not you observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manner of answering
me? How completely it meant, `why should my picture be drawn?'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still
I cannot imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not be persuaded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the
earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly,
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) various attempts at
portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might
decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) many beginnings were
displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and
water-colours had been all tried in turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had always wanted to do
every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than
many might have done with so little labour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would ever submit to.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadiness
had always been wanting; and in nothing had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) approached the degree of
excellence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have been glad to command, and ought not to
have failed of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not much deceived as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own skill either
as an artist or a musician, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not unwilling to have others
deceived, or sorry to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reputation for accomplishment often
higher than it deserved.

<p/>There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the
most; her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there
been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) two companions
would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness
pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No great variety of faces for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``I had only my own
family to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but the
idea of sitting for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) picture made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so nervous, that I could only
take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston
again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my
kindest friend on every occasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would sit whenever I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
There is my sister; and really quite her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own little elegant figure!--and
the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
would have sat longer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in such a hurry to have me draw
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) four children that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would not be quiet. Then, here come all my
attempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and
John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of
them might do for any one of the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) was so eager to have them
drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three
or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take
any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are
coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my
sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was sleeping on
the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) cockade as you would
wish to see. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had nestled down his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) head most conveniently. That's very
like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very
good. Then here is my last,'' (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman
in small size, whole-length--<div class="bookquote">``my last and my best--my brother, Mr. John
Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away
in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not
help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made
a very good likeness of it---LRB-Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in
thinking it _very_ like-RRB---only too handsome--too flattering--but
that was a fault on the right side'' (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>--after all this, came poor dear
Isabella's cold approbation of--<div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was a little like--but to be
sure it did not do him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) justice. We had had a great deal of trouble
in persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and
altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish
it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every
morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then
forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather
for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_
_present_, I will break my resolution now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was
repeating, <div class="bookquote">``No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as
you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>with so interesting a
consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not better
leave them together at once. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to be drawing, the
declaration must wait a little longer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be
a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was
destined, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could please herself, to hold a very honourable station
over the mantelpiece.

<p/>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not
keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of
youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no
doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and watching every
touch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) credit for stationing himself where he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might gaze
and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to
it, and request him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
to employ him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in reading.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness
indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) part, and lessen the
irksomeness of Miss Smith's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less
would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was ready at the
smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress,
and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) admiration made him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) discern a likeness almost before it
was possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not respect his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eye, but his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
complaisance were unexceptionable.

<p/>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite enough
pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want
of likeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant
to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more
height, and considerably more elegance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had great confidence of
its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling
its destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the
beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both;
with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising
attachment was likely to add.

<p/>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ought,
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the
party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,
took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the
picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,
but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every
criticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Woodhouse has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friend the only beauty she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
wanted,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>--observed Mrs. Weston to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--not in the least suspecting that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was addressing a lover.--<div class="bookquote">``The expression of the eye is most correct,
but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has them not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I cannot agree with you. It appears
to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a
likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) too tall, Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley.

<p/>Emma knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly
added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in short
gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.
Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of
such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse. <div class="bookquote">``So prettily done! Just as your
drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well
as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) seems
to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
shoulders--and it makes one think she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must catch cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.
Look at the tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, sir, may say any thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Elton, <div class="bookquote">``but I must confess that
I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of
doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other
situation would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss
Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep
my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few
difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the
order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,
must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse
could not bear the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) stirring out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) house in the fogs of
December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it
was removed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) gallantry was always on the alert. <div class="bookquote">``Might he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) be trusted
with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) have in executing
it! he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how
much he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was too good!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not endure the thought!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) would not give
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) such a troublesome office for the world,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>--brought on the desired
repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled
the business.

<p/>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give
the directions; and Emma thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could so pack it as to ensure its
safety without much incommoding him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed mostly fearful of
not being incommoded enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a precious deposit!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with a tender sigh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) received
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This man is almost too gallant to be in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>thought Emma. <div class="bookquote">``I should
say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of
being in love. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet
exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does
sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could
endure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.
But it is his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) gratitude on Harriet's account.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VII


<p/>The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion
for Emma's services towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,
as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to
return again to dinner: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) returned, and sooner than had been
talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something
extraordinary to have happened which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was longing to tell. Half a
minute brought it all out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had heard, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) got back to
Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and
finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a
little parcel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sisters, and gone away; and on
opening this parcel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had actually found, besides the two songs which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.
<div class="bookquote">``Who could have thought it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was so surprized she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not know what
to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter,
at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought so. And he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) wrote as if he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) very
much--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not know--and so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was come as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could to
ask Miss Woodhouse what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should do.--''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Emma was half-ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``the young man is determined not to lose any
thing for want of asking. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will connect himself well if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you read the letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``Pray do. I'd rather you
would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read, and was surprized. The style
of the letter was much above her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) expectation. There were not merely no
grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a
gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and
the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was
short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,
even delicacy of feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) paused over it, while Harriet stood
anxiously watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) opinion, with a <div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>and was at last
forced to add, <div class="bookquote">``Is it a good letter? or is it too short?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, a very good letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma rather slowly--<div class="bookquote">``so
good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sisters must have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I can hardly imagine the young man whom
I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if
left quite to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;
no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a
woman. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural
talent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a pen in
hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.
Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments
to a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet
-LRB-returning it,-RRB- than I had expected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said the still waiting Harriet;--<div class="bookquote">``well--and--and what shall I
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this
letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and
speedily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express
yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not
being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be
unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will
present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need
not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>)
disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I ought to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, looking down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>)! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any
doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been
under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel
in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were
consulting me only as to the wording of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you
advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do
with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) liked me so very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet,
contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that
letter might be too powerful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it best to say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as
to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should accept a man or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) certainly ought to refuse
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can hesitate as to `Yes,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to say `No' directly.
It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with
half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself,
to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would
just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As
you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be
hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say `No,'
perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling graciously, <div class="bookquote">``would I advise you
either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you
prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) the most
agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you
hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at
this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive
yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this
moment whom are you thinking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away
confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was
still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.
Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. At
last, with some hesitation, Harriet said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well
as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost
made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just
what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to
myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation
in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would
have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the
consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest
degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence;
but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have
visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you
for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet had not surmised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own danger, but the idea of it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
forcibly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not have visited me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cried, looking aghast. <div class="bookquote">``No, to be
sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have
been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not
give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing
in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it
must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.
I must have given you up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me
never to come to Hartfield any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I
wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must
have a pretty good opinion of himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is conceited either, in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
conscience opposing such censure; <div class="bookquote">``at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very good natured,
and I shall always feel much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and have a great regard
for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must
confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes
to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,
_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.
Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) being so much attached to me--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) writing such a letter--but as
to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be
parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is asked, or
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and can write a tolerable letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma felt the bad taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend, but let it pass with a <div class="bookquote">``very
true; and it would be a small consolation to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for the clownish
manner which might be offending her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) every hour of the day, to know that
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband could write a good letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always
happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). But
how shall I do? What shall I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised
its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance
being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.
The looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) letter again, in replying to it, had such a
softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) up
with a few decisive expressions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so very much concerned at
the idea of making him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) unhappy, and thought so much of what his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother
and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not
fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been accepted after all.

<p/>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business
was finished, and Harriet safe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was rather low all the evening, but
Emma could allow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by
speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of
Mr. Elton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was said in rather a
sorrowful tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You
are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but
at Hartfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Some time afterwards it was, <div class="bookquote">``I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much
surprized if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would--for
Miss Nash thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) own sister very well married, and it is only a
linen-draper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher
of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an
opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear
valuable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>)
is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be
among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I
are the only people to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) looks and manners have explained
themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that
people should like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly
cheering; but still, after a time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was tender-hearted again towards
the rejected Mr. Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) has got my letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) softly. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what they are all
doing--whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) sisters know--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) is unhappy, they will be unhappy
too. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) will not mind it so very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully
employed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. <div class="bookquote">``At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing
your picture to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful
is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,
allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My picture!--But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has left my picture in Bond-street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest
Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till
just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) horse to-morrow. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) companion all this
evening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) solace, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) delight. It opens his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) designs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) family,
it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those
pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm
prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy
their imaginations all are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet smiled again, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) smiles grew stronger.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII


<p/>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been
spending more than half her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) time there, and gradually getting to have
a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every
respect, safest and kindest, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with them as much as possible
just at present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or
two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) should
return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.
Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
mind to walk out, was persuaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter not to defer it, and was
induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley,
who had nothing of ceremony about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), was offering by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) short,
decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and
civil hesitations of the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not
consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and
go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had
better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,
Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to
entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my
three turns--my winter walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot do better, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a
very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you
have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think
the sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the
garden door for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being
immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more
chat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with more
voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot rate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) beauty as you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a
pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
disposition. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) character depends upon those she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is with; but in good
hands she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will turn out a valuable woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be
wanting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you
that you have improved her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). You have cured her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) school-girl's
giggle; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) really does you credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been
of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they
may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again, you say, this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost every moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has been gone longer already than she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
intended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something has happened to delay her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); some visitors perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said
nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) presently added, with a smile,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that
I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of
something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! how so? of what sort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very serious sort, I assure you;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>still smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)?
Who makes you their confidant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.
Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew Mr.
Elton looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have reason to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that Harriet Smith will soon have
an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert
Martin is the man. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have
done his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is desperately in love and means to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is very obliging,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``but is he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sure that Harriet means to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, means to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) an offer then. Will that do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to
the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knows
I have a thorough regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) family, and, I believe,
considers me as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) best friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to ask me whether
I thought it would be imprudent in him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to settle so early; whether
I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) too young: in short, whether I approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) choice
altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being considered
-LRB-especially since _your_ making so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)-RRB- as in a line of society
above him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). I was very much pleased with all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said. I never hear
better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) always speaks to the
purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) told me every
thing; his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in
the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is an excellent young man, both as son and
brother. I had no hesitation in advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to marry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) proved to me
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) away very happy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had never esteemed my opinion before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house
thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened
the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not allow
much time to pass before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke to the lady, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does not appear
to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should be at Mrs.
Goddard's to-day; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) may be detained by a visitor, without thinking
him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) at all a tiresome wretch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Mr. Knightley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, who had been smiling to herself
through a great part of this speech, <div class="bookquote">``how do you know that Mr. Martin
did not speak yesterday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), surprized, <div class="bookquote">``I do not absolutely know it; but it
may be inferred. Was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) the whole day with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you something, in return for what
you have told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did speak yesterday--that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wrote, and was
refused.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.
Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stood
up, in tall indignation, and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>). What is the
foolish girl about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``it is always incomprehensible to a man
that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always
imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the
meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is
so; but I hope you are mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) answer!--nothing could be clearer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) answer!--you wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) answer too. Emma, this is your
doing. You persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I did, -LRB-which, however, I am far from allowing-RRB- I should not
feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,
but I cannot admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized
indeed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) should have ventured to address her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). By your account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever
got over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Harriet's equal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and
with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, ``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is
not her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) equal indeed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) superior in sense as in
situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are
Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any
connexion higher than Robert Martin? She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is the natural daughter of
nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and
certainly no respectable relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is known only as parlour-boarder
at a common school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any
information. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and
too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) age she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can have
no experience, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little wit, is not very likely ever to have
any that can avail her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is pretty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is good tempered, and
that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) account,
as being beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) deserts, and a bad connexion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). I felt that,
as to fortune, in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might do much better; and that as
to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not do worse. But I
could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there
being no harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having that sort of disposition, which, in
good hands, like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), might be easily led aright and turn out very well.
The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side; and had not the
smallest doubt -LRB-nor have I now-RRB- that there would be a general cry-out
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.
It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's
leaving Highbury, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being settled so well. I remember
saying to myself, `Even Emma, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partiality for Harriet, will
think this a good match.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any
such thing. What! think a farmer, -LRB-and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) sense and all his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,-RRB- a good match for my intimate friend!
Not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom
I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should
think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are
very different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are
not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differently
by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is undoubtedly her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) moves is much above his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).--It would be a degradation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a
respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) birth, though in a legal sense she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) may
be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is not to pay
for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father
is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) allowance is
very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) improvement or
comfort.--That she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will
deny.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoever might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) parents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``whoever may have
had the charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), it does not appear to have been any part of
their plan to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) into what you would call good society. After
receiving a very indifferent education she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is left in Mrs. Goddard's
hands to shift as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line,
to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) friends evidently thought
this good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and it _was_ good enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) desired nothing
better herself. Till you chose to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) into a friend, her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) mind had
no distaste for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was as
happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had no sense of
superiority then. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) has it now, you have given it. You have been no
friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded
so far, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not felt persuaded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not being disinclined to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has too much real feeling to address any
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is
the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had
encouragement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this
assertion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chose rather to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own line of the subject
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,
are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so
contemptible as you represent them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is not a clever girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and
supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to be, as you describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), only pretty and good-natured,
let me tell you, that in the degree she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) possesses them, they are not
trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is, in fact, a
beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an
hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the
subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall
in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with
such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought
after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a
claim to be nice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim,
comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and
manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to
be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in
general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims
a woman could possess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost
enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply
it as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) playfully. <div class="bookquote">``I know _that_ is the feeling of
you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every
man delights in--what at once bewitches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses and satisfies his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to
marry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is the very woman for you. And is she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), at seventeen, just
entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does not accept the first offer she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) receives? No--pray let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) have time to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley
presently, <div class="bookquote">``though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive
that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) up
with such ideas of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own beauty, and of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has a claim to, that,
in a little while, nobody within her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reach will be good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing
so easy as for a young lady to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expectations too high. Miss
Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to
say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of
connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent
men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be
involved in, when the mystery of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parentage came to be revealed. Let
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marry Robert Martin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is safe, respectable, and happy for
ever; but if you encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to expect to marry greatly, and teach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large
fortune, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) life--or, at least, -LRB-for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry
somebody or other,-RRB- till she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the
old writing-master's son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there
can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more
angry. But as to my _letting_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) marry Robert Martin, it is impossible;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any
second application. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must abide by the evil of having refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>),
whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to
say that I might not influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) a little; but I assure you there
was very little for me or for any body to do. His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) appearance is so much
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) manner so bad, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ever were disposed to
favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not now. I can imagine, that before she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had seen
any body superior, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might tolerate him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was the brother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
friends, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) took pains to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); and altogether, having seen
nobody better -LRB-that must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) great assistant-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might not,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was at Abbey-Mill, find him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) disagreeable. But the case
is altered now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a
gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>cried Mr.
Knightley.--<div class="bookquote">``Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and
good-humour to recommend them; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mind has more true gentility than
Harriet Smith could understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very much to be gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
did not repent what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had done; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still thought herself a better
judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could be;
but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a sort of habitual respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) judgment in general,
which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dislike having it so loudly against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and to have him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
sitting just opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in angry state, was very disagreeable.
Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt
on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was
thinking. The result of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) thoughts appeared at last in these words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert Martin has no great loss--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can but think so; and I hope it
will not be long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does. Your views for Harriet are best known
to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it
is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and as
a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it
will be all labour in vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma laughed and disclaimed. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) continued,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,
and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make
an imprudent match. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knows the value of a good income as well as any
body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will act rationally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is
as well acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own claims, as you can be with Harriet's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) goes; and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) general way of talking in unreserved
moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) does
not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speak with great
animation of a large family of young ladies that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sisters are
intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing again. <div class="bookquote">``If I had
set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very
kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to
myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to
equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning to you,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), rising and walking off abruptly. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was
very much vexed. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) felt the disappointment of the young man, and was
mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had
given; and the part which he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,
was provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) exceedingly.

<p/>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more
indistinctness in the causes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)'s, than in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not always
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinions were right and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
walked off in more complete self-approbation than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and
the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying
away so long was beginning to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) uneasy. The possibility of the
young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with
Harriet and pleading his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread
of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when
Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any
such reason to give for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) long absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt a satisfaction which
settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own mind, and convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that let Mr.
Knightley think or say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done nothing which woman's
friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a little about Mr. Elton; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered
that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done, neither
with the interest, nor -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of
Mr. Knightley's pretensions-RRB- with the skill of such an observer on such
a question as herself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had spoken it hastily and in anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
was able to believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had rather said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wished resentfully
to be true, than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew any thing about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) certainly might have
heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had ever done, and
Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to
money matters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise
to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the
influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr.
Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its
effects; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming
any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and
more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very sure
did not belong to Mr. Elton.

<p/>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) came back, not
to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) something, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) repeated immediately with great
delight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,
and Miss Nash had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had told Miss Nash, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) was
coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had met Mr. Elton, and
found to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) road
to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the
whist-club night, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been never known to miss before; and Mr.
Perry had remonstrated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) about it, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) how shabby it
was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) journey only one day; but it would not
do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_
_particular_ way indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was going on business which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would
not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a
very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly
precious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) was very sure
there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) so; and Mr. Elton
only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.
Miss Nash had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) all this, and had talked a great deal more about
Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did
not pretend to understand what his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) business might be, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) only
knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should think the
luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
equal for beauty or agreeableness.''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX


<p/>Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>), but Emma could not quarrel with
herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) grave looks
shewed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not forgiven. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sorry, but could not repent.
On the contrary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plans and proceedings were more and more justified
and endeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) by the general appearances of the next few days.

<p/>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.
Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common
sitting-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) got up to look at it, and sighed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) half sentences
of admiration just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied
of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) furnished a
contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) views of improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little friend's mind, by a great deal of
useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few
first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much
easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination
range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary
pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing
all the riddles of every sort that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could meet with, into a thin
quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend, and ornamented with
ciphers and trophies.

<p/>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are
not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out
at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.
Emma assisted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote
a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first
order, in form as well as quantity.

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the
girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting
in. <div class="bookquote">``So many clever riddles as there used to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was young--he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
wondered he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not remember them! but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should in time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And it always ended in <div class="bookquote">``Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) good friend Perry, too, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had spoken to on the subject,
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>)
had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) went about so much,
something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought, might come from that quarter.

<p/>It was by no means his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury
in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one
whose assistance she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was invited to contribute any really good
enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might recollect; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had
the pleasure of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) most intently at work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) recollections;
and at the same time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could perceive, most earnestly careful that
nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the
sex should pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) lips. They owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) their two or three politest
puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) recalled, and
rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,

<p/>My first doth affliction denote,
Which my second is destin'd to feel
And my whole is the best antidote
That affliction to soften and heal.--

<p/>made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some
pages ago already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that
is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
life. The stupidest fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
stopt a moment--<div class="bookquote">``or Miss Smith could inspire him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table
containing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) said, a charade, which a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had addressed
to a young lady, the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) admiration, but which, from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Being my
friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,
but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could
understand. There was deep consciousness about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) found
it easier to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eye than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was gone the next
moment:--after another moment's pause,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards
Harriet--<div class="bookquote">``it is for you. Take your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never
loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.

<p/>To Miss--

<p/>CHARADE.

<p/>My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.
Another view of man, my second brings,
Behold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there, the monarch of the seas!

<p/>But ah! united, what reverse we have!
Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;
Lord of the earth and sea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) bends a slave,
And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

<p/>Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,
May its approval beam in that soft eye!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cast her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through
again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then
passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while
Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and
dulness, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse
charades. _Courtship_--a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This
is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--`Pray, Miss Smith,
give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my
intentions in the same glance.'

<p/>May its approval beam in that soft eye!

<p/>Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eye--of all epithets, the
justest that could be given.

<p/>Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.

<p/>Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in
love, indeed, to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the
benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life
you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade
indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the
eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I
cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find
it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it
kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady.
Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?

<p/>And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

<p/>Can it be Neptune?

<p/>Behold him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) there, the monarch of the seas!

<p/>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one
syllable. It must be very clever, or he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not have brought it. Oh!
Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking
of? Where would be the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bringing us a charade made by a friend
upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.

<p/>For Miss ------, read Miss Smith.

<p/>My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.

<p/>That is _court_.

<p/>Another view of man, my second brings;
Behold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there, the monarch of the seas!

<p/>That is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.

<p/>But ah! united, -LRB-_courtship_, you know,-RRB- what reverse we have!
Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.
Lord of the earth and sea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) bends a slave,
And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

<p/>A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which
I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in
comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of
its being written for you and to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) read
the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not
speak. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to feel.
Emma spoke for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You
are his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I
thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it
is clear; the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on
the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long
have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.
I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were
most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have
really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my
dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may
well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing
but good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration,
independence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your
real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy
for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in
either of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Miss Woodhouse!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and <div class="bookquote">``Dear Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>was all that Harriet,
with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did
arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever you say is always right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``and therefore I
suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not
have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,
who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--`To Miss ------.'
Dear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a
certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to
the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by
matter-of-fact prose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,
a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take
place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and
really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so
evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement of
other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.
You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one
another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying
will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a
something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right
direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.

<p/>The course of true love never did run smooth--

<p/>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that
passage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,
who did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), at Michaelmas! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), the very
handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,
quite like Mr. Knightley! His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) company so sought after, that every body
says he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) need not eat a single meal by himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not chuse it;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so
excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has
ever preached from since he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back
to the first time I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and
I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look
through herself; however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) called me back presently, and let me
look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
looked! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, must
be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we
are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to
see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives
every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same
country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will
be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the
common phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the
respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand
every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This
charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any
thing like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) meant to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) skill, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manner of declining it
yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as long again as almost all we have had before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things
in general cannot be too short.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory
comparisons were rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), presently--her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cheeks in a glow--<div class="bookquote">``to have
very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is
any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you
must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's
prose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such sweet lines!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>continued Harriet--<div class="bookquote">``these two last!--But how shall I
ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?--Oh! Miss
Woodhouse, what can we do about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it to me. You do nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will be here this evening, I dare
say, and then I will give it him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back, and some nonsense or other will
pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall
chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful
charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not
write it into your book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but those two lines are'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>--<div class="bookquote">``The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private
enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,
because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its
meaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a
very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would not like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) charade slighted, much better than his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or
neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be
no possible reflection on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet submitted, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind could hardly separate the parts,
so as to feel quite sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend were not writing down a
declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree
of publicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``a most natural feeling; and the longer it
lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you
will not object to my reading the charade to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It will be giving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
so much pleasure! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves any thing of the sort, and especially any
thing that pays woman a compliment. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has the tenderest spirit of
gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet looked grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You
will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too
quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning
which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little
tribute of admiration. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been anxious for secrecy, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not
have left the paper while I was by; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rather pushed it towards me
than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has
encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over
this charade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the
recurrence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) very frequent inquiry of <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dears, how does
your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A
piece of paper was found on the table this morning---LRB-dropt, we suppose,
by a fairy-RRB---containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied
it in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) read it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked to have any thing read, slowly and
distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every
part as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) proceeded--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was very much pleased, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had
foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.
`Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I
can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so
prettily, but you, Emma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very
tender sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother
was so clever at all those things! If I had but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) memory! But I can
remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have
heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are
several.

<p/>Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,
Kindled a flame I yet deplore,
The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,
Though of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) near approach afraid,
So fatal to my suit before.

<p/>And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever all
the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the
Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.

<p/>Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.

<p/>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was very near being
christened Catherine after her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) grandmama. I hope we shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) here
next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)--and what
room there will be for the children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own room, of course; the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) always
has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you
know. Why should there be any change?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was here!--not
since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's
being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is sadly taken
away from us all!--and how sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will be when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) comes, not to see
Miss Taylor here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will not be surprized, papa, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I
first heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was going to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But---LRB-in a very depressed tone-RRB---she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of
necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we
ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time
they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken
out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) claim this
Christmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), than
with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be
anywhere but at Hartfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sat musing
a little while, and then said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so
soon, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to
stay longer with us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and the children might stay very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I
do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse
could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) spirits affected
by the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediately
led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet must give us as much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) company as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can while my brother
and sister are here. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will be pleased with the children.
We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
will think the handsomest, Henry or John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, I wonder which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be
to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mama. Henry is the
eldest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was named after me, not after his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father. John, the second,
is named after his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that
the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) called Henry, which I
thought very pretty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is a very clever boy, indeed. They
are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will
come and stand by my chair, and say, `Grandpapa, can you give me a bit
of string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knives
were only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with
them very often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) appears rough to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``because you are so very gentle
yourself; but if you could compare him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with other papas, you would not
think him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rough. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishes his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boys to be active and hardy; and if
they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is an
affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate
father. The children are all fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a
very frightful way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such
enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of
their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I cannot understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot
understand the pleasures of the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate
in preparation for the regular four o’clock dinner, the hero of this
inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could
receive him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) with the usual smile, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quick eye soon discerned in
his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was come to see how it might turn up. His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ostensible
reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made
up in the evening without him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should be in the smallest
degree necessary at Hartfield. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) were, every thing else must give
way; but otherwise his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friend Cole had been saying so much about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
dining with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)--had made such a point of it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
conditionally to come.

<p/>Emma thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), but could not allow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) disappointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) friend
on their account; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father was sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rubber. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) re-urged--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
re-declined; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed then about to make his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bow, when taking the
paper from the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) returned it--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank
you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured
to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take it
amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight
lines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looked rather
doubtingly--rather confused; said something about <div class="bookquote">``honour,'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--glanced at
Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took
it up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an
awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade
must not be confined to one or two. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may be sure of every woman's
approbation while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) writes with such gallantry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no hesitation in saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating
a good deal while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">``I have no hesitation in saying--at least
if my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that,
could he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) see his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, -LRB-looking at the
book again, and replacing it on the table-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would consider it as the
proudest moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After this speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think
it too soon; for with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) good and agreeable qualities, there was
a sort of parade in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speeches which was very apt to incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to
laugh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and
the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.



<p/>CHAPTER X


<p/>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to
prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the
morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who
lived a little way out of Highbury.

<p/>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane
leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of
the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr.
Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about
a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not
very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had
no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the
present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility
of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing
eyes.--Emma's remark was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these
days.'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--Harriet's was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow
curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not often walk this way _now_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, as they proceeded, <div class="bookquote">``but
_then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately
acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part
of Highbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) found, had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) life been inside the Vicarage,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors
and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with
Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we could contrive it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but I cannot think of any
tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire
about of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) housekeeper--no message from my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some
minutes, Harriet thus began again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or
going to be married! so charming as you are!'' (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Emma laughed, and replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;
I must find other people charming--one other person at least. And I
am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little
intention of ever marrying at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be
tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, -LRB-recollecting herself,-RRB- is out of the
question: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather not
be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I
must expect to repent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall
in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in
love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.
And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a
situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;
consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much
mistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never
could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and
always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if
I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--so
smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so apt
to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry
to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any
likeness, except in being unmarried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty
only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single
woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old
maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good
fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant
as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the
candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very
narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.
Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and
generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This
does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is only too good natured and
too silly to suit me; but, in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is very much to the taste
of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not
contracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mind: I really believe, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had only a shilling in the
world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody
is afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>): that is a great charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you
grow old?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great
many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more
in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's
usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they
are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read
more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for
objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the
great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil
to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the
children of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough
of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that
declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and every
fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it
suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My
nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
a hundred times--but are you acquainted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) comes to
Highbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit
with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people
half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) does about Jane
Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is read forty times over; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) compliments to all friends go round
and round again; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) does but send her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) aunt the pattern of a
stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) grandmother, one hears of
nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) tires
me to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were
superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor
were as sure of relief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) personal attention and kindness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
counsel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) patience, as from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) purse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) understood their ways,
could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic
expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had
done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and
always gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In
the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could give
comfort or advice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitted the cottage with such an impression of
the scene as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) say to Harriet, as they walked away,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make
every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but
these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how
soon it may all vanish from my mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``Poor creatures! one can think of nothing
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said
Emma, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended
the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them
into the lane again. <div class="bookquote">``I do not think it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>stopping to look once
more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still
greater within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) companion.

<p/>They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was
passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma
time only to say farther,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good
thoughts. Well, -LRB-smiling,-RRB- I hope it may be allowed that if compassion
has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that
is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can
for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet could just answer, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>before the gentleman joined
them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the
first subject on meeting. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been going to call on them. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) visit
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about
what could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to
accompany them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>thought Emma;
<div class="bookquote">``to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase
of love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the
declaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one
side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
not been there two minutes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found that Harriet's habits of
dependence and imitation were bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) up too, and that, in short,
they would both be soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). This would not do; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) immediately
stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the
footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would
follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) judged it reasonable to have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) boot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had the comfort
of farther delay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) power, being overtaken by a child from the
cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pitcher, to fetch
broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to
and question her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), was the most natural thing in the world, or would have
been the most natural, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) been acting just then without design;
and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without
any obligation of waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gained on them, however,
involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in
a conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with
animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,
having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might draw back
a little more, when they both looked around, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to join
them.

<p/>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;
and Emma experienced some disappointment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was only
giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
friend Cole's, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,
the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the
dessert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This would soon have led to something better, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
consoling reflection; <div class="bookquote">``any thing interests between those who love; and
any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I
could but have kept longer away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage
pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the
house, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) again find something very much amiss about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) boot, and
fall behind to arrange it once more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) then broke the lace off short,
and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to
entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inability to put herself to
rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Part of my lace is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I do not know how I am to
contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I
hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop
at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string,
or any thing just to keep my boot on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could
exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) alertness and attention in conducting them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) house and
endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were
taken into was the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind
it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between
them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assistance in the most comfortable manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to leave
the door ajar as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fully intended that Mr. Elton
should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but
by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hoped to make
it practicable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to chuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own subject in the adjoining
room. For ten minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) could hear nothing but herself. It could be
protracted no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was then obliged to be finished, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
appearance.

<p/>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most
favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having
schemed successfully. But it would not do; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had not come to the point.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been most agreeable, most delightful; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had told Harriet that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little
gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cautious, very cautious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>thought Emma; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) advances inch by inch, and
will hazard nothing till he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) believes himself secure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
ingenious device, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not but flatter herself that it had been
the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them
forward to the great event.



<p/>CHAPTER XI


<p/>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power
to superintend his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happiness or quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) measures. The coming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,
and then in reality, it became henceforth her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prime object of interest;
and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be
expected--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,
fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to the lovers. They might
advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or
other whether they would or no. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hardly wished to have more leisure
for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they
will do for themselves.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent
from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.
Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been
divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of
this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was
therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their
Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be
induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and
who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in
forestalling this too short visit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thought much of the evils of the journey for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and not a little
of the fatigues of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own horses and coachman who were to bring some
of the party the last half of the way; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) alarms were needless;
the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John
Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,
all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,
the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed
and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nerves could
not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even
for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father
were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) little ones, and for their
having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and
drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,
without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long
a disturbance to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), either in themselves or in any restless attendance
on them.

<p/>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet
manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt
up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly
attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a
warmer love might have seemed impossible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could never see a fault
in any of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not a woman of strong understanding or any
quickness; and with this resemblance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) inherited also
much of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constitution; was delicate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own health, over-careful
of that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own Mr. Wingfield in town as her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father could be of Mr. Perry.
They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong
habit of regard for every old acquaintance.

<p/>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;
rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) profession, domestic, and respectable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) private
character; but with reserved manners which prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being generally
pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not an
ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a
reproach; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) temper was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) great perfection; and, indeed, with
such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects
in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) temper
must hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
wanted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not a great favourite with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) was quick in feeling the little injuries to
Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) might have
passed over more had his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,
but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without
praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal
compliment could have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) regardless of that greatest fault of
all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) eyes which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sometimes fell into, the want of respectful
forbearance towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father. There he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not always the patience
that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and
fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to a rational remonstrance or
sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John
Knightley had really a great regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father-in-law, and generally
a strong sense of what was due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); but it was too often for Emma's
charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently
to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of
every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of
necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.
They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a
melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's attention
to the sad change at Hartfield since she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been there last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with ready sympathy, <div class="bookquote">``how you must miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)!
And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so
grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>).--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is pretty well, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the
place agrees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) tolerably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts
of the air of Randalls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my
life--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) own regret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much to the honour of both,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the handsome reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), sir, tolerably often?''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>asked Isabella in the
plaintive tone which just suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father.

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--<div class="bookquote">``Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they
married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,
have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,
either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most
frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston
is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way,
you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be
aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be
assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) by
any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact
truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as it should be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. John Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``and just as I hoped
it was from your letters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wish of shewing you attention could not be
doubted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I
have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change
being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have
Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse--<div class="bookquote">``yes, certainly--I cannot
deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty
often--but then--she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is always obliged to go away again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not, papa.--You quite
forget poor Mr. Weston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley pleasantly, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Weston has
some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the
poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims
of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all
the Mr. Westons aside as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife hearing</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--
<div class="bookquote">``Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a
greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for
the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss
Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting
Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does
not deserve. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is one of the very best-tempered men that ever
existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) equal
for temper. I shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flying Henry's kite for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that
very windy day last Easter--and ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) particular kindness last
September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o’clock at night,
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I
have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better
man in existence.--If any body can deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it must be Miss Taylor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the young man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been here on this
occasion--or has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not been here yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma. <div class="bookquote">``There was a strong
expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in
nothing; and I have not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentioned lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and a very
proper, handsome letter it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) shewed it to me. I thought it very
well done of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indeed. Whether it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own idea you know, one
cannot tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is but young, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle, perhaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three-and-twenty!--is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indeed?--Well, I could not have thought
it--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was but two years old when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poor mother! Well,
time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an
exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal
of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.
28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it
was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'--I remember that perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very pleasing and proper of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. John Knightley/Mrs. Knightley</b></font>)</div>cried the good-hearted Mrs. John
Knightley. <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being a most amiable young man. But
how sad it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not live at home with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father! There is
something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parents and
natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body
who proposed such a thing to any body else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>observed Mr.
John Knightley coolly. <div class="bookquote">``But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt
what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather
an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) takes
things as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other,
depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing
whist with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection,
or any thing that home affords.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had
half a mind to take it up; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) struggled, and let it pass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and
valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to
himself, whence resulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother's disposition to look down on
the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was
important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.



<p/>CHAPTER XII


<p/>Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination of
Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in
Isabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it;
and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement
between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) the proper
invitation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped they might now become friends again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it was time
to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ certainly had not been
in the wrong, and _he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)_ would never own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had. Concession must be
out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had
ever quarrelled; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped it might rather assist the restoration of
friendship, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) came into the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had one of the children
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who
was now making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced
about in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) began with grave
looks and short questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was soon led on to talk of them all in
the usual way, and to take the child out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms with all the
unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;
and the conviction giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at first great satisfaction, and then
a little sauciness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not help saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was admiring the
baby,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.
As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with
regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,
and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with
them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always
think alike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the
wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), smiling--<div class="bookquote">``and reason good. I was sixteen years old when
you were born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A material difference then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied--<div class="bookquote">``and no doubt you were much
my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the
lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal
nearer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--a good deal _nearer_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we
think differently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,
let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little
Emma, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old
grievances, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) were not wrong before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``very true. Little Emma, grow up a better
woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.
Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good
intentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects on
my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that
Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man cannot be more so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) short, full answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) appearance, and <div class="bookquote">``How d’ye do, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``John, how are
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that
seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led
either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the
other.

<p/>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards
entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) dear Isabella, and
the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally
distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in
one or the other.

<p/>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally
of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,
and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had generally
some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious
anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at
Donwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to
give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting
to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the change
of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for
wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality
of interest by John, as his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cooler manners rendered possible; and if his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
willing brother ever left him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) any thing to inquire about, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) inquiries
even approached a tone of eagerness.

<p/>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a
full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor dear Isabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), fondly taking her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand, and
interrupting, for a few moments, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) busy labours for some one of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
five children--<div class="bookquote">``How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!
And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,
my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and
I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all
have a little gruel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, that both the
Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and
two basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of
gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every
body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South
End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should not
have gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) recommended it for all the children, but particularly for
the weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea air and bathing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) any
good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though
perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use
to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, <div class="bookquote">``I must
beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;--I
who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear
Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) never forgets you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has
not time to take care of himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has not time to take
care of himself--which is very sad--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) is always wanted all round
the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But
then there is not so clever a man any where.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?
I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) will be calling soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>)
will be so pleased to see my little ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) comes,
you had better let him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) look at little Bella's throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear sir, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) throat is so much better that I have hardly any
uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>), or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.
Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have
spoken to--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I
have not heard one inquiry after them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mention
them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.
Bates--I will call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to-morrow, and take my children.--They
are always so pleased to see my children.--And that excellent Miss
Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--How are they, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a
bad cold about a month ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been
this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) has never known them more
general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you
mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it
altogether a sickly season.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly
except--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always
a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a
dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the
air so bad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is
very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London
in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very
different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be
unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is
hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in:
but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of
Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--but
after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different
creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think
you are any of you looking well at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those
little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely
free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were
rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a
little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of
coming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I
assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) did not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) had ever
sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that
you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes with
affectionate anxiety towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley
very far from looking well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. John
Knightley, hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking
well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have
wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you
left home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Isabella,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--exclaimed he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) hastily--<div class="bookquote">``pray do not concern yourself
about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and
the children, and let me look as I chuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff
from Scotland, to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) new estate. What will it answer? Will
not the old prejudice be too strong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father and sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had nothing
worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane
Fairfax, though no great favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was at that
moment very happy to assist in praising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. John Knightley/Mrs. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. John Knightley.--<div class="bookquote">``It
is so long since I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), except now and then for a moment
accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) good old
grandmother and excellent aunt, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) comes to visit them! I always
regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cannot be more at
Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.
Campbell will not be able to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be such a
delightful companion for Emma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty
kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a
better companion than Harriet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so
very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar
moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not
close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied
a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting
decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty
severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with
tolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter
had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never
had been able to understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant by a basin of nice smooth
gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had wished for and ordered
it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a
dangerous opening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) head and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It
does not bear talking of.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>And for a little while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would not
talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to
the relish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,
instead of coming here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a
great deal of good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been
to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to
hear you had fixed upon South End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite
a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, never
found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is
entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) may
be depended on, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) own brother and family have been there repeatedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perry
was a week at Cromer once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) holds it to be the best of all the
sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) says, and very pure air. And, by
what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from
the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have
consulted Perry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how
great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else
should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to
chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,
better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into
a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) a very
ill-judged measure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma's attempts to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father had been vain; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
had reached such a point as this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
brother-in-law's breaking out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Perry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>), in a voice of very strong displeasure, <div class="bookquote">``would do
as well to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) opinion till it is asked for. Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) make it
any business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family to
one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of
my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) directions no more than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) drugs.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only
sarcastic dryness, <div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and
five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater
expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as
willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--<div class="bookquote">``very
true. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was telling
you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the
right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive
any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of
inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly
the present line of the path... The only way of proving it, however,
will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow
morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me
your opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
friend Perry, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had, in fact, though unconsciously, been
attributing many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing
attentions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) daughters gradually removed the present evil, and
the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the
other, prevented any renewal of it.



<p/>CHAPTER XIII


<p/>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John
Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning
among her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) old acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) five children, and talking over what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had done every evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father and sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had nothing
to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a
delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.

<p/>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their
mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,
there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no
denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was
persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of
the party.

<p/>How they were all to be conveyed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have made a difficulty if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
could, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually
at Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was not able to make more than a simple question on
that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long
to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that they might in one of the carriages find room for
Harriet also.

<p/>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the
only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as
well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being
consulted in every thing.

<p/>The evening before this great event -LRB-for it was a very great event that
Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December-RRB- had been spent
by Harriet at Hartfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had gone home so much indisposed with
a cold, that, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.
Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to leave the house. Emma called
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the next day, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) doom already signed with regard to
Randalls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard
was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet
herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
from this delightful engagement, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) loss
without many tears.

<p/>Emma sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in Mrs. Goddard's
unavoidable absences, and raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) spirits by representing how much Mr.
Elton's would be depressed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) state; and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) at last
tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) having a most
comfortless visit, and of their all missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had not
advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was met by Mr.
Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly
together in conversation about the invalid--of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), on the rumour
of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might
carry some report of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John
Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) two eldest
boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country
run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice
pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and
proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's
complaint;--<div class="bookquote">``a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat
about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), a quick, low pulse, &c. and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was sorry to find from Mrs.
Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often
alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with them.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid
infectious sort. Has Perry seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)? Indeed you should take care of
yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.
Why does not Perry see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this
excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and
care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>)
could not wish to reason away, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) would rather feed and assist
than not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like
snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I
should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from
venturing; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind, and does not seem to feel the
cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great
a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton,
in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a
little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and
what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than
common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did not very well know what answer to make;
which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind
care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma,
too eager and busy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own previous conceptions and views to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
impartially, or see him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with clear vision, was very well satisfied with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) muttering acknowledgment of its being <div class="bookquote">``very cold, certainly very
cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) from Randalls,
and secured him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour
of the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``we will make your apologies to Mr. and
Mrs. Weston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so spoken, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother was civilly
offering a seat in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only
objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt
satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;
never had his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) smile been stronger, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) eyes more exulting than when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) next looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to herself, <div class="bookquote">``this is most strange!--After I had got
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill
behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,
especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining
out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,
their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any
thing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most
valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love
with Harriet; but still, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot refuse an invitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must dine
out wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is asked. What a strange thing love is! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can see ready
wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not but do him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice while
assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair
friend, the last thing before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prepared for the happiness of meeting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped to be able to give a better report; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of
approbation much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) favour.

<p/>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began
with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.
Elton. It is downright labour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) where ladies are concerned. With
men he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) can be rational and unaffected, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has ladies to please,
every feature works.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``but where there is
a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great
deal. Where a man does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best with only moderate powers, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will
have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect
good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seems
to have a great deal of good-will towards you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied with a smile of astonishment, <div class="bookquote">``are you imagining me to
be Mr. Elton's object?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never
occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it
is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your
manners to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better
look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and
I are very good friends, and nothing more;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on, amusing
herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a
partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high
pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well
pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother for imagining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blind and ignorant, and in
want of counsel. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) said no more.

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind to the visit, that in
spite of the increasing coldness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to have no idea of shrinking
from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eldest
daughter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the
weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own
going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was
cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe;
and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow
were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so
overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world
in a very short time.

<p/>Emma soon saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) companion was not in the happiest humour. The
preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,
which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anticipated
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the
whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
discontent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``must have a very good opinion of himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks
people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as
this, for the sake of coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must think himself a most
agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest
absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowing
people to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not staying
comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such
an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we
should deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing
than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of
the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view
or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in
another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said
and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.
Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and
four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering
creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had
at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no
doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the <div class="bookquote">``Very true,
my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which must have been usually administered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) travelling
companion; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had resolution enough to refrain from making
any answer at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not be complying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dreaded being
quarrelsome; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heroism reached only to silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to
talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips.

<p/>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,
spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with
pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and
cheerfulness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was so very cheerful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) civilities indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) must have received a different account of Harriet from
what had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had sent while dressing, and the answer had
been, <div class="bookquote">``Much the same--not better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) presently, <div class="bookquote">``was not so
pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was _my_ answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) face lengthened immediately; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice was the voice of
sentiment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that
when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing
before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,
by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned--I
had flattered myself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must be better after such a cordial as I
knew had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma smiled and answered--<div class="bookquote">``My visit was of use to the nervous part of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;
it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), as you
probably heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has been used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow
morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is
impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) will be missed every moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really
estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay
when only half a minute afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) began to speak of other things,
and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an excellent device,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the use of a sheepskin for
carriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold
with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have
rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced
and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way
unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very
cold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!
snows a little I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``and I think we shall have a good deal of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christmas weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Elton. <div class="bookquote">``Quite seasonable; and
extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin
yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly
have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been
much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite
the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites
their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst
weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing
could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away
till that very day se’nnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not comprehend the pleasure, but
said only, coolly,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too much
astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed
quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are sure of excellent fires,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and every thing in the
greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Weston
indeed is much beyond praise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is exactly what one values, so
hospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where
small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.
Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably;
and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by
two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, -LRB-turning with
a soft air to Emma,-RRB- I think I shall certainly have your approbation,
though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of
London, may not quite enter into our feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with
any body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! -LRB-in a tone of wonder and pity,-RRB- I had no idea that the law had
been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will
be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great
enjoyment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My first enjoyment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>replied John Knightley, as they passed through the
sweep-gate, <div class="bookquote">``will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV


<p/>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they
walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill-humour. Mr.
Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the
place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as
happy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.
Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the
world to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke with such unreserve, as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; not any
one, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) related with such conviction of being listened to and
understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the
little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father
and herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston
had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication
of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life
depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.

<p/>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not
afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the
very sight of Mrs. Weston, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) touch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) voice was grateful
to Emma, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) determined to think as little as possible of Mr.
Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that
was enjoyable to the utmost.

<p/>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough
to give the history of it, besides all the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own and
Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just
got to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) satisfaction that James should come and see his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost
wholly engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) attentions to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), was able to turn away and
welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dear Emma.

<p/>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rather sorry
to find, when they had all taken their places, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
The difficulty was great of driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) strange insensibility towards
Harriet, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) not only sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) elbow, but
was continually obtruding his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happy countenance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) notice, and
solicitously addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) behaviour was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not avoid the internal
suggestion of <div class="bookquote">``Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be
possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections from
Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would be so anxious
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father,
and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly
like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
good manners. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own sake she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be rude; and for Harriet's,
in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was even positively
civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on
amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's
nonsense, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) particularly wished to listen to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard enough
to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
heard the words <div class="bookquote">``my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>repeated several
times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was announcing an early visit from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could
quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving
question from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have been awkward.

<p/>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never
marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr.
Frank Churchill, which always interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had frequently
thought--especially since his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) _were_ to marry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was the very person to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in age,
character and condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed by this connexion between the
families, quite to belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) could not but suppose it to be
a match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.
Weston did think of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was very strongly persuaded; and though
not meaning to be induced by him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), or by any body else, to give up a
situation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed more replete with good than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could
change it for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had a great curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), a decided intention
of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pleasant, of being liked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to a certain degree, and
a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends'
imaginations.

<p/>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very
cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly
pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the
substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for
when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,
at dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) made use of the very first interval in the cares of
hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>),

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see
two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and
then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me
telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank.
I had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) this morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will be with us within a
fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party
quite complete.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has been wanting to come to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``ever since
September: every letter has been full of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) cannot command his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
own time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has those to please who must be pleased, and who -LRB-between
ourselves-RRB- are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.
But now I have no doubt of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) here about the second week in
January.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so
anxious to be acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be almost as happy as
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks there will be another put-off.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) coming so much as I do: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not
know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is---LRB-but this is
quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other
room. There are secrets in all families, you know-RRB---The case is, that a
party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and
that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not
put off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family
that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular
dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in
two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.
I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing
Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:
but your good friend there -LRB-nodding towards the upper end of the table-RRB-
has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at
Hartfield, that she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been
long in the practice of doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied
Emma; <div class="bookquote">``but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at
the place in my life.--She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself
to speak ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>), on Frank's account; for I do believe her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) to be very
fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). I used to think she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) was not capable of being fond of
any body, except herself: but she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) has always been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) -LRB-in her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing
to be as she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) likes-RRB-. And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>),
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say
it to any body else, she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) has no more heart than a stone to people in
general; and the devil of a temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma liked the subject so well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,
very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) joy--yet
observing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--
Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should be very glad to be
secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked
of: <div class="bookquote">``for I cannot depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) coming. I cannot be so sanguine as
Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.
Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.
Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Emma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``what is the certainty
of caprice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending
before--<div class="bookquote">``You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means
so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father
thinks. It depends entirely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt's spirits and pleasure; in
short, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on
the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered
woman; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming now, depends upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being willing to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>replied Isabella:
<div class="bookquote">``and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest
compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must
be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but
it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) never had any
children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would have made them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should then have
heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), with a degree of unreserve
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would not hazard with Isabella; and, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) really believed,
would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), excepting those views on the young man, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own
imagination had already given her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) such instinctive knowledge. But at
present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon
followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after
dinner, was a confinement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not endure. Neither wine nor
conversation was any thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and gladly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) move to those with
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was always comfortable.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of
saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means
certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,
whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even
if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that
some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine
any reluctance on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) side; but I am sure there is a great wish on
the Churchills' to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to themselves. There is jealousy. They
are jealous even of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father. In short, I can feel no
dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could stay only a couple of days,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having
it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fall into
bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants
to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_`s being under such
restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
likes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before
one decides upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Weston. <div class="bookquote">``One ought to
use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one
individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must
not be judged by general rules: _she (<font color='blue'><b>Enscombe</b></font>)_ is so very unreasonable; and every
thing gives way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Enscombe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Enscombe</b></font>) is so fond of the nephew: he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) is so very great a favourite. Now,
according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
owes every thing, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) exercises incessant caprice towards _him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)_,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) owes
nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand
a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.
I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) having, at times, considerable influence; but it
may be perfectly impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to know beforehand _when_ it will
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma listened, and then coolly said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall not be satisfied, unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) may have a great deal of influence on some points,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs.
Weston, <div class="bookquote">``and on others, very little: and among those, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) is
beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) coming away from them to visit us.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XV


<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tea; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
tea he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) three
companions could do, to entertain away his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) notice of the lateness of
the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and
convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last
the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very
good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma
were sitting together on a sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joined them immediately, and, with
scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.

<p/>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind by
the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) late
improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as before, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
making Harriet his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very first subject, was ready to listen with most
friendly smiles.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) professed himself extremely anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair friend--her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair,
lovely, amiable friend. <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) know?--had she (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) heard any thing about
her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), since their being at Randalls?--he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) felt much anxiety--he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) must
confess that the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) complaint alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) considerably.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And in this style he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) talked on for some time very properly, not much
attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror
of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) account, than on
Harriet's--more anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should escape the infection, than
that there should be no infection in the complaint. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) began with great
earnestness to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber
again, for the present--to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to _promise_ _him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)_ not to venture
into such hazard till he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) opinion; and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its
proper course, there was no putting an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) extreme solicitude
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealing
it--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), instead of
Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had difficulty in behaving with temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned to Mrs. Weston
to implore her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) assistance, <div class="bookquote">``Would not she (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) support?--would
not she (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) add her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) persuasions to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go
to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had
no infection? He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) could not be satisfied without a promise--would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
give him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) influence in procuring it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So scrupulous for others,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and yet so careless for
herself! She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and
yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore
throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not I
some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an
address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of
first interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and as for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too much provoked and
offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could only give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a look; but it was such a look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought
must restore him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a
seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did
another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room
from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information
of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing
fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.
Woodhouse:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,
sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way
through a storm of snow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else
had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,
and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston
and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) and turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) attention from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
son-in-law, who was pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) triumph rather unfeelingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I admired your resolution very much, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in venturing out
in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.
Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and
I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow can
hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is
blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other
at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest
it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely
to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was afraid they
would find no difficulty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wished the road might be impassable, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost
good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,
calling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wife to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), that with a little contrivance,
every body might be lodged, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hardly knew how to do, from the
consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>was Mr.
Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could say for some
time. To her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) looked for comfort; and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) assurances of safety, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of
their having so many friends about them, revived him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) a little.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) own. The horror of being
blocked up at Randalls, while her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children were at Hartfield, was full
in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for
adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was eager
to have it settled, that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father and Emma should remain at Randalls,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband set forward instantly through all the possible
accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better order the carriage directly, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I dare
say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we
do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all
afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes,
you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that
gives me cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most
extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing
does give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,
I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) approbation of the plan. Mrs.
Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could
not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;
and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had
left the room immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother's first report of the snow,
came back again, and told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been out of doors to examine,
and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their
getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
had gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snow
was nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to
whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the
clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon
over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in there
being nothing to apprehend.

<p/>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were
scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's account, who
was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nervous
constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be
appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued at
Randalls. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning
home, but no assurances could convince him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that it was safe to stay; and
while the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley
and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready, if the others are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I ring the bell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more,
and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own
house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) temper and
happiness when this visit of hardship were over.

<p/>The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such
occasions, was carefully attended to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.
Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal
of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the
discovery of a much darker night than he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been prepared for. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
afraid they should have a very bad drive. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was afraid poor Isabella
would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together
as they could;''  (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very
slow and wait for the other carriage.

<p/>Isabella stept in after her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father; John Knightley, forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
did not belong to their party, stept in after his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wife very naturally;
so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second
carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,
and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have been
the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,
previous to the suspicions of this very day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have talked to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but
one. But now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would rather it had not happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had
been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
would want to be talking nonsense.

<p/>To restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as much as might be, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of
the weather and the night; but scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) begun, scarcely had they
passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
subject cut up--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand seized--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention demanded, and Mr. Elton
actually making violent love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>): availing himself of the precious
opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known,
hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); but
flattering himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ardent attachment and unequalled love and
unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,
very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It
really was so. Without scruple--without apology--without much apparent
diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)_ lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); but vainly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would go on, and say
it all. Angry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, the thought of the moment made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolve to
restrain herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt that half this folly must
be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to
the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the
playful, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped would best suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) half and half state, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget
yourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall
be happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) possibly
mean!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--And he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) words with such assurance of accent, such
boastful pretence of amazement, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not help replying with
quickness,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account
for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak
either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough
to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spirits, not at
all to confuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) intellects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) perfectly knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own meaning; and
having warmly protested against her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) suspicion as most injurious, and
slightly touched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) respect for Miss Smith as her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friend,--but
acknowledging his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
resumed the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own passion, and was very urgent for a
favourable answer.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thought less of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) inebriety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thought more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,
replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself
too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can
express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last
month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily
habit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an
unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!
Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object
of such professions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Elton, <div class="bookquote">``what can be the meaning of this?--Miss
Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my
existence--never paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) any attentions, but as your friend: never
cared whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
has fancied otherwise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own wishes have misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and I am very
sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!
who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my
honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of
you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one
else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has
been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You
cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!---LRB-in an accent meant to be
insinuating-RRB---I am sure you have seen and understood me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which
of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too completely
overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence
being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
tried to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joyously exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting
silence. It confesses that you have long understood me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``it confesses no such thing. So far from having
long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect
to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you
should have been giving way to any feelings--Nothing could be farther
from my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), -LRB-pursuit, it appeared,-RRB- gave me great pleasure, and I have been
very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were not
your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged
ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have
never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you
have never thought seriously of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), affronted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) turn: <div class="bookquote">``never, I assure you.
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of
girl; and I should be happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) respectably settled. I wish
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object
to--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,
quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal
alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--No, madam, my
visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I
received--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely
mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my
friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common
acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake
ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might
have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,
probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you
are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I
trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was too angry to say another word; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manner too decided to invite
supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually
deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,
for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If
there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate
awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the
little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage
turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,
all at once, at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) house; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was out before another
syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) a good
night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under
indescribable irritation of spirits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was then conveyed to Hartfield.

<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, who
had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage
Lane--turning a corner which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could never bear to think of--and in
strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.
John Knightley, ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill-humour, was now all kindness and
attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>)
father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in a basin of
gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the
day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,
except herself.--But her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind had never been in such perturbation; and
it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the
usual hour of separating allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) the relief of quiet reflection.



<p/>CHAPTER XVI


<p/>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think
and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow
of every thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been wishing for!--Such a development of every
thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst
of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or
other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in
error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) actually was, could the
effects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) blunders have been confined to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have
borne any thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presumption to me--but poor
Harriet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could have been so deceived!--He (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had never
thought seriously of Harriet--never! She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked back as well as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could; but it was all confusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had taken up the idea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manners, however, must
have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not have been so
misled.

<p/>The picture!--How eager he (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been about the picture!--and the
charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had
seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its <div class="bookquote">``ready
wit'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--but then the <div class="bookquote">``soft eyes'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--in fact it suited neither; it was
a jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such
thick-headed nonsense?

<p/>Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had often, especially of late, thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manners to
herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way, as a mere
error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not always lived in the best society, that with all the
gentleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,
till this very day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean
any thing but grateful respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as Harriet's friend.

<p/>To Mr. John Knightley was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) indebted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first idea on the
subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying
that those brothers had penetration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) remembered what Mr. Knightley
had once said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) about Mr. Elton, the caution he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had given,
the conviction he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry
indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
character had been there shewn than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had reached herself. It
was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many
respects, the very reverse of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had meant and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>);
proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own claims, and little
concerned about the feelings of others.

<p/>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) opinion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) professions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
proposals did him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) no service. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attachment,
and was insulted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wanted to marry well, and having the
arrogance to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), pretended to be in love; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was
perfectly easy as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) not suffering any disappointment that need be
cared for. There had been no real affection either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) language or
manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could
hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less
allied with real love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) need not trouble herself to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse
of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so
easily obtained as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had fancied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would soon try for Miss Somebody
else with twenty, or with ten.

<p/>But--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should talk of encouragement, should consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) as aware
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) views, accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attentions, meaning -LRB-in short-RRB-, to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)!--should suppose himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) equal in connexion or mind!--look down
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no
presumption in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>)!--It was most provoking.

<p/>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to feel how very much he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>)
inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of
such equality might prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) perception of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must know that
in fortune and consequence she (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) was greatly his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) superior. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must
know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at
Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the
Eltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was
inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,
to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from
other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell
Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had
long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which
Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
to notice but his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) situation and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) civility.--But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had fancied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); that evidently must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) dependence; and
after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners
and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop
and admit that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been so complaisant and
obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as -LRB-supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) real
motive unperceived-RRB- might warrant a man of ordinary observation and
delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.
If _she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ had so misinterpreted his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had little right to
wonder that _he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)_, with self-interest to blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), should have mistaken
hers.

<p/>The first error and the worst lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) door. It was foolish, it was
wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It
was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what
ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite
concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here have I,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``actually talked poor Harriet into being very
much attached to this man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might never have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but for
me; and certainly never would have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with hope, if I had
not assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attachment, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is as modest and humble as I
used to think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not
to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done
of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and
chance. I was introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) into good company, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the
opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have
attempted more. But now, poor girl, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) peace is cut up for some time.
I have been but half a friend to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were _not_ to feel this
disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body
else who would be at all desirable for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>);--William Coxe--Oh! no, I
could not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopt to blush and laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own relapse, and then resumed a more
serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be,
and must be. The distressing explanation she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to make to Harriet, and
all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of
future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the
acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding
eclat, were enough to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in most unmirthful reflections some
time longer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) went to bed at last with nothing settled but the
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) having blundered most dreadfully.

<p/>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary
gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of
spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,
and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough
to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of
softened pain and brighter hope.

<p/>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had gone
to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and to
depend on getting tolerably out of it.

<p/>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in
love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to
disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior
sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that there
could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the
three principals, and especially for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's being given a moment's
uneasiness about it.

<p/>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow
on the ground did her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) further service, for any thing was welcome that
might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.

<p/>The weather was most favourable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); though Christmas Day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
daughter attempted it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was therefore safe from either exciting
or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered
with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and
thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every
morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to
freeze, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse
with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) on Sunday any
more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's
absenting himself.

<p/>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to be really taking comfort in some society
or other, it was very pleasant to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father so well satisfied with
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being all alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own house, too wise to stir out; and to
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from
them,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>These days of confinement would have been, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) private
perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) companions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
ill-humour at Randalls, that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) amiableness never failed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) during the
rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stay at Hartfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was always agreeable and obliging,
and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of
cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such
an evil hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as
made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.



<p/>CHAPTER XVII


<p/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The
weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.
Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter to stay
behind with all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children, was obliged to see the whole party
set off, and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) lamentations over the destiny of poor
Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) life with those she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) doated
on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently
busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.

<p/>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.
Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with
Mr. Elton's best compliments, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was proposing to leave Highbury
the following morning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) way to Bath; where, in compliance with
the pressing entreaties of some friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had engaged to spend a few
weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was under, from
various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal
leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should ever
retain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be
happy to attend to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at this
time was the very thing to be desired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) for contriving
it, though not able to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) much credit for the manner in which it
was announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than
in a civility to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so pointedly excluded.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not even a share in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opening compliments.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) name was not
mentioned;--and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an
ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) graceful acknowledgments, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, at first, could not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's suspicion.

<p/>It did, however.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father was quite taken up with the surprize of so
sudden a journey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to
the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) language. It was a
very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought
and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse
talked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual promptitude.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had reason
to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nearly recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cold, and it was desirable that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should have as much time as possible for getting the better of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) other complaint before the gentleman's return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to Mrs.
Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary
penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to destroy
all the hopes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been so industriously feeding--to appear in
the ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself
grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas on one subject, all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) observations, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convictions, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prophecies for the last
six weeks.

<p/>The confession completely renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first shame--and the sight of
Harriet's tears made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should never be in charity with
herself again.

<p/>Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in every
thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion
of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;
and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on
Harriet's side, not her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own. Harriet did not consider herself as having
any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton
would have been too great a distinction.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) never could have deserved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would
have thought it possible.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tears fell abundantly--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) grief was so truly artless, that
no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart and
understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the
superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be more for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could
do.

<p/>It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and
ignorant; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with every previous resolution confirmed of
being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) second duty now, inferior only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's claims, was
to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own affection
in some better method than by match-making. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to Hartfield,
and shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and
amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
thoughts.

<p/>Time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in
general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton
in particular; but it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reasonable that at Harriet's age,
and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be
made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as
to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,
without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.

<p/>Harriet did think him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) all perfection, and maintained the non-existence
of any body equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in person or goodness--and did, in truth,
prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet
it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so natural, so inevitable to strive against an
inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not comprehend its
continuing very long in equal force.

<p/>If Mr. Elton, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) return, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own indifference as evident and
indubitable as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would anxiously do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not
imagine Harriet's persisting to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happiness in the sight or the
recollection of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).

<p/>Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for
each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of
effecting any material change of society. They must encounter each
other, and make the best of it.

<p/>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) companions at Mrs.
Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great
girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could
have any chance of hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spoken of with cooling moderation or
repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be
found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the way of
cure, there could be no true peace for herself.



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII


<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.
Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For
the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not be spared, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``very great mortification
and regret; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) looked forward with the hope of coming to
Randalls at no distant period.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in
fact, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dependence on seeing the young man
had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever
expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by
any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,
and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and
sorry; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three
months later would be a much better plan; better time of year;
better weather; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would be able, without any doubt, to stay
considerably longer with them than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had come sooner.

<p/>These feelings rapidly restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of
a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of
excuses and delays; and after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) concern for what her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband was
to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.

<p/>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr.
Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted, rather, to
be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
should appear, in general, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual self, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took care to express
as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr.
and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their
friendship.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite
as much as was necessary, -LRB-or, being acting a part, perhaps rather
more,-RRB- at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) then
proceeded to say a good deal more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt, of the advantage of
such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of
looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the
sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have made; and ending with reflections on the
Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement
with Mr. Knightley; and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) great amusement, perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was
taking the other side of the question from her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) real opinion, and making
use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Churchills are very likely in fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, coolly;
<div class="bookquote">``but I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might come if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know why you should say so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wishes exceedingly to come; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) uncle and aunt will not spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has not the power of coming, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) made a
point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) such an unnatural creature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) may have learnt to be above his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) connexions, and to care very little
for any thing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own pleasure, from living with those who have
always set him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than
one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud,
luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If
Frank Churchill had wanted to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would have contrived it
between September and January. A man at his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) age--what is he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?--three or
four-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.
It is impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your
own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the

to manage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty
should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot want
money--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has so
much of both, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in
the kingdom. We hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for ever at some watering-place or other. A
little while ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at Weymouth. This proves that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can leave the

Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew
can do. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) can at
others.''

that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and
resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) knows it to be so, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) promises and messages; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at
once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--`Every sacrifice of
mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience;
but I must go and see my father immediately. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be hurt by
my failing in such a mark of respect to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the present occasion.
I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would say so to her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)

have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to
your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to
the uncle and aunt, who have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) up, and are to provide for
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as

good, raise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) higher, fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interest stronger with the people he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do.
Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could
trust him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that the nephew who had done rightly by his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) father, would do
rightly by them; for they know, as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) does, as well as all the

where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have
a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great

transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation,
you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have
a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early
obedience and long observance to break through. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) who has, it might
not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set
all their claims on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gratitude and regard at nought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) may have as
strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so
equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.''

following his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for
the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became rational, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in
their authority. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have opposed the first attempt on their

perfection. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has; and though it may cut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off from some

himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) has hit upon the very best method in the world of
preserving peace at home and preventing his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) father's having any right to

account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must doubly

herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French,
not in English. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be very `amiable,' have very good manners, and be

Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately
talk of something else, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not comprehend why he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be
angry.

<p/>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be of a
different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of
mind which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was always used to acknowledge in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for with all the
high opinion of himself, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had often laid to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) charge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
never before for a moment supposed it could make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unjust to the merit
of another.




<p/>VOLUME II



<p/>CHAPTER I


<p/>Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's
opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could
not think that Harriet's solace or her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own sins required more; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they
returned;--but it burst out again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had succeeded,
and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and
receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton is so good
to the poor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found something else must be done.

<p/>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was
always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates
loved to be called on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was considered by the very few
who presumed ever to see imperfection in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), as rather negligent in
that respect, and as not contributing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) ought to the stock of
their scanty comforts.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own heart,
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion
of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--and
all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and
third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) seldom went near them. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) made the sudden resolution of not
passing their door without going in--observing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) proposed it to
Harriet, that, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could calculate, they were just now quite
safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.

<p/>The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied
the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,
which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even
gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting was
seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place to
Miss Woodhouse, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more active, talking daughter, almost ready
to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit,
solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's
health, cheerful communications about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother's, and sweet-cake from
the beaufet--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for ten
minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and _she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)_ had
taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) liked it very much;
and, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them
the favour to eat a piece too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.
There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the
letter over again, and settle how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had been gone, and how much
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) was engaged in company, and what a favourite he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) was wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went,
and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went
through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation
that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's
being obliged to say a word.

<p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been prepared for when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) entered the house; but meant,
having once talked him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by
any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses
and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not been
prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was actually
hurried off by Miss Bates, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) jumped away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at last abruptly to
the Coles, to usher in a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece.

<p/>``Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--Mrs. Cole
was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--Mrs. Cole was so
kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) came in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) began inquiring after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), Jane is so very great a
favourite there. Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to
shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much
as any body can. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) began inquiring after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) directly, saying,
`I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
time for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have, we
had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body
more surprized. `Have you, upon your honour?' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); `well, that is
quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says.'''

<p/>Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I
hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. You are so kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>the aunt</b></font>)</div>replied the happily deceived aunt, while
eagerly hunting for the letter.--``Oh! here it is. I was sure it could
not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being
aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately
that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs.
Cole, and since she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for
it is such a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)--a letter from Jane--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) can never
hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is,
only just under my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to
Jane, apologise for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) writing so short a letter--only two pages you
see--hardly two--and in general she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) fills the whole paper and crosses
half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) often
says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty, now I think
you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--don't you,
ma’am?--And then I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would contrive to make it out
herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had nobody to do it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--every word of it--I am sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would pore over it till she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had made out every word. And, indeed,
though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can see
amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such
a blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is here, `I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong
eyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I
only wish my eyes may last me as well.'''

<p/>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;
and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss
Fairfax's handwriting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are extremely kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; <div class="bookquote">``you who
are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is
nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's.
My mother does not hear; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a little deaf you know. Ma’am,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say
about Jane's handwriting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own silly compliment repeated
twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very
rude, of making her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost
resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss
Bates turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) again and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all. By
only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is sure to hear; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is used to my voice. But it is very
remarkable that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should always hear Jane better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does me.
Jane speaks so distinct! However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmama at all
deafer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my
mother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was here. We never were so long without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before, and as
I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so
surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
will be as happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) friends at Highbury, as they can be to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>). Yes, Friday or Saturday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) cannot say which, because Colonel
Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So very
good of them to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) the whole way! But they always do, you know. Oh
yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) writes about. That is
the reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the
common course, we should not have heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) before next Tuesday or
Wednesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my
hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been
for this particular circumstance, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) being to come here so soon. My
mother is so delighted!--for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is to be three months with us at
least. Three months, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says so, positively, as I am going to have the
pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are
going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father and mother to come
over and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) directly. They had not intended to go over till the
summer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is so impatient to see them again--for till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) married,
last October, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was never away from them so much as a week, which must
make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,
but however different countries, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wrote a very urgent letter
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) mother--or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father, I declare I do not know which it was, but
we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as
well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own, to press their coming over directly, and they would
give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country
seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great
deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ever
heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) should like to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own place while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
addresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--for
Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's
not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all
blame them; of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heard every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) might be telling Miss
Campbell about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own home in Ireland; and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) wrote us word
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had
taken himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane
was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) account of things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's
brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the
not going to Ireland, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) said, with the insidious design of farther
discovery,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to
come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to be
excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been
rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) at such a
distance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing was
to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want
her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. and Mrs. Dixon-RRB- excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.
Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing
than their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;
Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is
a most charming young man. Ever since the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) rendered Jane at
Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), by the
sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have
been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) habit--
-LRB-I can never think of it without trembling!-RRB---But ever since we had the
history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friends' urgency, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own wish of seeing

recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) native
air, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) has not been quite so well as usual lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.

no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be
compared with Miss Fairfax.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.
There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely
plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,

it before, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not alarm us. Just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)! so
considerate!--But however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is so far from well, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) kind
friends the Campbells think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had better come home, and try an air
that always agrees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); and they have no doubt that three or four
months at Highbury will entirely cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)--and it is certainly a great
deal better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should come here, than go to Ireland, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is
unwell. Nobody could nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), as we should do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells
leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will
find from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,
what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) grown thin, and
looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to
me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through
to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for
fear of there being any thing in them to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Jane desired me
to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;
but no sooner did I come to the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) being unwell, than I
burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--which
my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed
at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had
fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does
not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my
guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The
expense shall not be thought of; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) is so liberal, and so
fond of Jane that I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) would not mean to charge any thing for
attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has a wife and
family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) time. Well, now I
have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) letter, and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own story a great deal better
than I can tell it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid we must be running away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, glancing at Harriet,
and beginning to rise--<div class="bookquote">``My father will be expecting us. I had no
intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,
when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not
pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so
pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>And not all that could be urged to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) succeeded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) regained
the street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had in fact heard the whole substance of
Jane Fairfax's letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had been able to escape the letter itself.



<p/>CHAPTER II


<p/>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest
daughter.

<p/>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the --regiment of infantry,
and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope
and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy
remembrance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dying in action abroad--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) widow sinking under
consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.

<p/>By birth she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on
losing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) became the property, the charge, the consolation,
the foundling of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every
probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being permanently fixed there; of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being taught
only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no
advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what
nature had given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a pleasing person, good understanding, and
warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.

<p/>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father gave a change
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded
Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and
farther, had been indebted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for such attentions, during a severe
camp-fever, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed had saved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. These were claims which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the
death of poor Fairfax, before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own return to England put any thing in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did return, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought out the child and took notice
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about
Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and
growing a favourite with all; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was nine years old, his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)
daughter's great fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) own wish of being a real
friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking
the whole charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) education. It was accepted; and from that period
Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them
entirely, only visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmother from time to time.

<p/>The plan was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should be brought up for educating others; the
very few hundred pounds which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) father making
independence impossible. To provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) otherwise was out of Colonel
Campbell's power; for though his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) income, by pay and appointments, was
handsome, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fortune was moderate and must be all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughter's;
but, by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) an education, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hoped to be supplying the means of
respectable subsistence hereafter.

<p/>Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had fallen into good hands, known
nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent
education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline
and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every
lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of
first-rate masters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) disposition and abilities were equally worthy
of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was,
as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,
fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was too
much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote,
and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was
easy to decide that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was still too young; and Jane remained with
them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of
an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with
only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own
good understanding to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that all this might soon be over.

<p/>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss
Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from
the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and
acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen
by the young woman, nor could her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) higher powers of mind be unfelt by the
parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the
marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often
defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is
moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of
Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were
acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had
yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) bread to earn.

<p/>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be
yet attempted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) less fortunate friend towards entering on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) path
of duty; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had now reached the age which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own judgment had
fixed on for beginning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had long resolved that one-and-twenty
should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had
resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from
all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace
and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.

<p/>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such
a resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no
exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for
their own comfort they would have retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) wholly; but this would
be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they
began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the
temptation of any delay, and spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) from a taste of such enjoyments
of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,
affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying
on the wretched moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had never been quite well since the time of
their daughter's marriage; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) should have completely recovered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) usual strength, they must forbid her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) engaging in duties, which, so
far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,
seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something
more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with
tolerable comfort.

<p/>With regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) not accompanying them to Ireland, her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) account to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths
not told. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) own choice to give the time of their absence to
Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) last months of perfect liberty with
those kind relations to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was so very dear: and the Campbells,
whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or
treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they
depended more on a few months spent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) native air, for the recovery
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was to
come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which
had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the
present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two
years' absence.

<p/>Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not like
through three long months!--to be always doing more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished,
and less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought! Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not like Jane Fairfax might be a
difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) it was
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) the really accomplished young woman, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly
refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) conscience could not quite acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). But <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) could never get
acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) did not know how it was, but there was such
coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pleased or
not--and then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was made
such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that
they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every
body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>These were her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
reasons--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had no better.

<p/>It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified
by fancy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any
considerable absence, without feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>); and
now, when the due visit was paid, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) arrival, after a two years'
interval, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was particularly struck with the very appearance and
manners, which for those two whole years she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had been depreciating. Jane
Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had herself the
highest value for elegance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) height was pretty, just such as almost
every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
figure particularly graceful; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) size a most becoming medium, between
fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point
out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and
then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) features--there was more beauty in them altogether
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing
beauty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had
never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been used to
cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really
needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was
the reigning character, and as such, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must, in honour, by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,
and merit.

<p/>In short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with
twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering
justice, and was determining that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) no longer. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) took in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) history, indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) situation, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) beauty;
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was
going to sink from, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was going to live, it seemed impossible
to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every
well-known particular entitling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) to interest, were added the highly
probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had
so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more
pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had resolved on.
Emma was very willing now to acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of having seduced Mr. Dixon's
actions from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wife, or of any thing mischievous which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination
had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,
successless love on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have been unconsciously
sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be
denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself
effectually from him (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) connexions by soon beginning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) career of
laborious duty.

<p/>Upon the whole, Emma left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with such softened, charitable feelings,
as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury
afforded no young man worthy of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) independence; nobody that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
could wish to scheme about for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had committed
herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,
or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than
saying to Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) certainly is handsome; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is better than
handsome!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmother
and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.
Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more
tiresome, because anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) health was now added to admiration
of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how
little bread and butter she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ate for breakfast, and how small a slice
of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new
workbags for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.
They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise
which necessarily followed appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) an affectation of candour, an
air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own very
superior performance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was, besides, which was the worst of all, so
cold, so cautious! There was no getting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) real opinion. Wrapt up in
a cloak of politeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed determined to hazard nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.

<p/>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more reserved on
the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed bent
on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own value
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all
general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.
It did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) no service however. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caution was thrown away. Emma saw
its artifice, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first surmises. There probably _was_
something more to conceal than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,
had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only
to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.

<p/>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) and Mr. Frank Churchill
had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a
little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma
procure as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) truly was. <div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) handsome?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) believed
he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was reckoned a very fine young man.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) agreeable?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was
generally thought so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) appear a sensible young man; a young
man of information?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``At a watering-place, or in a common London
acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were
all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than
they had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) believed every body found his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
manners pleasing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Emma could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER III


<p/>Emma could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>);--but as neither provocation nor resentment
were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had
seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was
expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with
Mr. Woodhouse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) approbation of the whole; not so openly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might
have done had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough
to be very intelligible to Emma. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been used to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unjust to
Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very pleasant evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been
talked into what was necessary, told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) understood, and the papers
swept away;--<div class="bookquote">``particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some
very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting
at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;
sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss
Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing
undone. I was glad you made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) play so much, for having no instrument
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am happy you approved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``but I hope I am not
often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father instantly; <div class="bookquote">``_that_ I am sure you are not.
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,
you are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed
round once, I think it would have been enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; <div class="bookquote">``you are not often
deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I
think you understand me, therefore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>An arch look expressed--<div class="bookquote">``I understand you well enough;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said
only, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax is reserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always told you she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was--a little; but you will soon overcome all
that part of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its
foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) diffident. I do not see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), moving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) chair into one close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant
evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and
amused to think how little information I obtained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am disappointed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) only answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope every body had a pleasant evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
quiet way. <div class="bookquote">``I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I
moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.
Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) always is, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speaks rather too quick. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is very agreeable, and Mrs.
Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane
Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a
very well-behaved young lady indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have found the evening
agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had Emma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, sir; and Emma, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had Miss Fairfax.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the
present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.
I am always watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to admire; and I do pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were more gratified than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cared to
express; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose
thoughts were on the Bates's, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a
great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one can
venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now we
have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;
it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other
pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure
of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without
the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast
pork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.
There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and
the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but
that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it
is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle
boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a
little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley presently, <div class="bookquote">``I have a piece of news for you.
You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will
interest you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smile
so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had time only to say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>when the door was
thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full
of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest.
Mr. Knightley soon saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) moment, and that not another
syllable of communication could rest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--I
come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You
are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be
married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so
completely surprized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not avoid a little start, and a
little blush, at the sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what
had passed between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where could _you_ hear it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bates. <div class="bookquote">``Where could you
possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I
received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at least
ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--I
was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane was
standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was so
afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would
go down and see, and Jane said, `Shall I go down instead? for I think
you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh!
my dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note. A Miss
Hawkins--that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley,
how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told
Mrs. Cole of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had just
read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more
generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My
mother desires her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very best compliments and regards, and a thousand
thanks, and says you really quite oppress her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We consider our Hartfield pork,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Woodhouse--<div class="bookquote">``indeed it
certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot
have a greater pleasure than--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good
to us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth
themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.
We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr.
Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--
Here was a sly glance at Emma. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been so fortunate as to--I forget
the precise words--one has no business to remember them. The information
was, as you state, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) style, I should imagine it just settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton going to be married!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could speak.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will have every body's wishes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is very young to settle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had
better not be in a hurry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed to me very well off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was. We
were always glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at Hartfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bates, joyfully;
<div class="bookquote">``my mother is so pleased!--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot bear to have the poor old
Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have
never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to
occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) replied, starting on this appeal;
<div class="bookquote">``is he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--is he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) a tall man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who shall answer that question?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. <div class="bookquote">``My father would say
`yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is just the
happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,
you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in
Highbury, both in person and mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is the very best young
man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
was precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, an
excellent young woman. His (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) extreme attention to my mother--wanting
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to sit in the vicarage pew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might hear the better, for my
mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not
hear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says it did
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.
And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>). It
is such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do.
Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,
such very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a
happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>turning
to Mr. Woodhouse, <div class="bookquote">``I think there are few places with such society as
Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear
sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is
pork--a roast loin of pork--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) has been acquainted
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it
cannot be a very long acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has been gone only four weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,
Emma said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take an interest
in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late
on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss
Campbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.
Elton and Miss Hawkins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I have seen Mr. Elton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>replied Jane, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say I shall be
interested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some
months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bates, <div class="bookquote">``four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had
always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that
I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said, `No, Mr.
Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do not think I am
particularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it.
What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if
Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so
good-humouredly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) knows I would not offend for the world. How does
Miss Smith do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs.
John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you
know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in
person--tall, and with that sort of look--and not very talkative.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.
One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is
not, strictly speaking, handsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was
plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to be plain,
and that you yourself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,
I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the
general opinion, when I called him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does
not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my
dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most
agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's;
but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home
directly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is the
better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not
attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) cares for
any thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be another
thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming
too. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be
so kind as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good
morning to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma, alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, had half her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention wanted by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to
marry strangers too--and the other half she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own view
of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece
of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could hope
was, by giving the first information herself, to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from hearing
it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was likely
to call. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were to meet Miss Bates in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way!--and upon its
beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would
be detaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would
undoubtedly rush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) without preparation.

<p/>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,
when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which
hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss
Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>which instantly burst forth,
had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was
given, Emma felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not now shew greater kindness than in
listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to
tell. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had
been afraid it would rain--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had been afraid it would pour down
every moment--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) might get to Hartfield first--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>)
had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was passing by the
house where a young woman was making up a gown for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would just step in and see how it went on; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not seem
to stay half a moment there, soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came out it began to rain,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know what to do; so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran on directly, as fast as
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could, and took shelter at Ford's.'' (<font color='red'><b>Ford/Mrs. Ford</b></font>)</div>--Ford's was the principal
woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop
first in size and fashion in the place.--<div class="bookquote">``And so, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) had
set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,
perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was
so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--who should come in, but
Elizabeth Martin and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) brother!--Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I
thought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting
near the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was busy
with the umbrella. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked away directly,
and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the
shop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away
you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the
world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) buyings, they
began whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and
I could not help thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to speak to me---LRB-do
you think he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was, Miss Woodhouse?-RRB---for presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came forward--came
quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,
if I would. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not do any of it in the same way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) used; I
could see she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was altered; but, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to _try_ to be very
friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no
more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss
Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to
hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting
away--and then--only think!--I found he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was coming up towards me
too--slowly you know, and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not quite know what to do; and
so he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling
dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and
said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got
three yards from the door, when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came after me, only to say, if I was
going to Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's
stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!
dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was
very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>): you know I could not do less; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went
back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but
I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,
I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,
there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) behave so pleasantly and
so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and
make me comfortable again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to stop and think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not thoroughly
comfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister's, seemed
the result of real feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could not but pity them. As Harriet
described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection
and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed them to be
well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make
in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of
course, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be sorry to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)--they must be all sorry. Ambition,
as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped
to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of
Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what
signified her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) praise?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) exerted herself, and did try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) comfortable, by considering
all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt
on,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might be distressing, for the moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but you seem to
have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never,
as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet said, <div class="bookquote">``very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``would not think about it;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but still
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) talked of it--still she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at
last, in order to put the Martins out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, was obliged to hurry
on the news, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had meant to give with so much tender caution;
hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only
amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of
Mr. Elton's importance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)!

<p/>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not feel
the first intelligence as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have done the day before, or an hour
before, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation
was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity,
wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins,
which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) fancy.

<p/>Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It
had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any
influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), without seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), where hitherto they had wanted either the
courage or the condescension to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); for since her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) refusal of the
brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth
might pass without their being thrown together again, with any
necessity, or even any power of speech.



<p/>CHAPTER IV


<p/>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting
situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of
being kindly spoken of.

<p/>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in
Highbury, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) was, by some means or other, discovered to have
every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly
accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived
to triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) merits,
there was very little more for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to do, than to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) Christian
name, and say whose music she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) principally played.

<p/>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had gone away rejected and
mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what
appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) strong encouragement; and not only losing the right
lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
had gone away deeply offended--he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came back engaged to another--and
to another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such
circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came back gay
and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse,
and defying Miss Smith.

<p/>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of
perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,
of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some
dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had not
thrown himself away--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had gained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with such delightful rapidity--the first hour of
introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice;
the history which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress
of the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidental
rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs.
Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--with consciousness and
agitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--so
sweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase,
been so very ready to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), that vanity and prudence were equally
contented.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, and
was just the happy man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be; talking only of himself and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughed
at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young
ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been more
cautiously gallant.

<p/>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to
please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which
a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
next entered Highbury he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bride.

<p/>During his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present short stay, Emma had barely seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but just enough
to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the impression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now
spread over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever thought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasing at all; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight was so
inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that,
except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable
humiliation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have been thankful to be assured
of never seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very well; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pain, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) welfare twenty miles off would administer most
satisfaction.

<p/>The pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued residence in Highbury, however, must
certainly be lessened by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be
prevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would
be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink
without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility
again.

<p/>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was good enough
for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsome
enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion,
there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own vaunted
claims and disdain of Harriet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had done nothing. On that article,
truth seemed attainable. _What_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, must be uncertain; but _who_
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not
appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was at all Harriet's superior. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brought no name, no
blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters
of a Bristol--merchant, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) must be called; but, as the whole
of the profits of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it
was not unfair to guess the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) line of trade had been very
moderate also. Part of every winter she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had been used to spend in Bath;
but Bristol was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the
father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the law
line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), than
that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was in the law line; and with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) the daughter had lived. Emma
guessed him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise.
And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder
sister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_, to a gentleman in a _great_
_way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the
history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.

<p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) but have given Harriet her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feelings about it all! She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had
talked her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) into love; but, alas! she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not so easily to be talked out
of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's
mind was not to be talked away. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might be superseded by another; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin
would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feared, would cure
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always
in love. And now, poor girl! she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was considerably worse from this
reappearance of Mr. Elton. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was always having a glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
somewhere or other. Emma saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only once; but two or three times every
day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), or _just_ to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>),
_just_ to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice, or see his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) shoulder, _just_ to have something
occur to preserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fancy, in all the favouring warmth of
surprize and conjecture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, moreover, perpetually hearing about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); for, excepting when at Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was always among those who
saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as
the discussion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) concerns; and every report, therefore, every
guess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the
arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) affairs, comprehending income, servants, and
furniture, was continually in agitation around her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) regard was
receiving strength by invariable praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) regrets kept
alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss
Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed
attached!--his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) air as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) walked by the house--the very sitting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
hat, being all in proof of how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was in love!

<p/>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>)
friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind,
Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton
predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful
as a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of
the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the
knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth
Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had
not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), written
in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great
deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been much
occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,
and wishing to do more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in
person, had driven away all such cares. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) staid, the Martins were
forgotten; and on the very morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martins</b></font>) setting off for Bath again,
Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.

<p/>How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--and
what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.
Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would
be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the
acquaintance--!

<p/>After much thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could determine on nothing better, than
Harriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had
understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal
acquaintance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) meant to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the carriage, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at the
Abbey Mill, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) drove a little farther, and call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) again
so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous
recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree
of intimacy was chosen for the future.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely
glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?



<p/>CHAPTER V


<p/>Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
friend called for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at Mrs. Goddard's, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evil stars had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.
Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of
being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where
the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk
and the direction, was consequently a blank.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to be
put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between
espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which
had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to
revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who
was married, and settled in Donwell.

<p/>The quarter of an hour brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) punctually to the white gate again;
and Miss Smith receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) summons, was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) without delay, and
unattended by any alarming young man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) came solitarily down the
gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) seemingly with ceremonious civility.

<p/>Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was
feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) enough to
understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had
been talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's
saying, all of a sudden, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) thought Miss Smith was grown, had
brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very
room she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been measured last September, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) two friends. There
were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window.
_He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour,
the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same
regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they
were just growing again like themselves, -LRB-Harriet, as Emma must suspect,
as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,-RRB- when the carriage
reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness
of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given
to those with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had thankfully passed six weeks not six months
ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might
resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had
the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a
_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not repent. They must be
separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much
to herself at this time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) soon felt the necessity of a little
consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to
procure it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The
refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.

<p/>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither
<div class="bookquote">``master nor mistress was at home;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>they had both been out some time; the
man believed they were gone to Hartfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is too bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, as they turned away. <div class="bookquote">``And now we shall
just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so
disappointed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leaned back in the corner, to indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being
the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage
stopt; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were
standing to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). There was instant pleasure in the sight of
them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston
immediately accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d’ye do?--how d’ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--glad
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this
morning--we see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is at
Oxford to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be
so. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had come at Christmas he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could not have staid three days; I
was always glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have
just the right weather for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), fine, dry, settled weather. We shall
enjoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could
wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the
influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was
by the words and the countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, fewer and quieter, but not
less to the purpose. To know that _she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)_ thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) coming certain was
enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rejoice in
their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.
The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in
the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped Mr. Elton would now
be talked of no more.

<p/>Mr. Weston gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which
allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) command,
as well as the route and the method of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) journey; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened,
and smiled, and congratulated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall soon bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) over to Hartfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), at the conclusion.

<p/>Emma could imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better move on, Mr. Weston,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we are detaining the
girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I am ready;'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--and turning again to Emma, <div class="bookquote">``but you must
not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only
had _my_ account you know; I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is really nothing
extraordinary:'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--though his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own sparkling eyes at the moment were
speaking a very different conviction.

<p/>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a
manner that appropriated nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>was Mrs.
Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four o’clock!--depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be here by three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>was Mr.
Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.
Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore
a different air; James and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) horses seemed not half so sluggish as
before. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at the hedges, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought the elder at least
must soon be coming out; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned round to Harriet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw
something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--was a
question, however, which did not augur much.

<p/>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma
was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.

<p/>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful
pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at four.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, dear anxious friend,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), in mental soliloquy, while
walking downstairs from her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own room, <div class="bookquote">``always overcareful for every
body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,
going again and again into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) room, to be sure that all is right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The clock struck twelve as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) passed through the hall. ```Tis twelve;
I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this
time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the
possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>)
soon.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
father--Mr. Weston and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son. They had been arrived only a few
minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) explanation of Frank's
being a day before his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) time, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father was yet in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
very civil welcome and congratulations, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) appeared, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.

<p/>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not think too much had
been said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) praise; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was a _very_ good looking young man; height,
air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) countenance had a great
deal of the spirit and liveliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked quick and
sensible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt immediately that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); and there was
a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came intending to be acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and that acquainted
they soon must be.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had reached Randalls the evening before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was pleased with the
eagerness to arrive which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) plan, and travel
earlier, later, and quicker, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might gain half a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston with exultation, <div class="bookquote">``I told you
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be here before the time named. I remembered what I
used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help
getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in
upon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal
more than any little exertion it needs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young
man, <div class="bookquote">``though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;
but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The word _home_ made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father look on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with fresh complacency.
Emma was directly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew how to make himself agreeable; the
conviction was strengthened by what followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very much pleased
with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly
allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to
Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself
to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but
one's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,
passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a
falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner had
no air of study or exaggeration. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did really look and speak as if in a
state of no common enjoyment.

<p/>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening
acquaintance. On his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) side were the inquiries,--<div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>one</b></font>) a
horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a large
neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were
several very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was
it a musical society?''

 (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div><p/>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance
proportionably advanced, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) contrived to find an opportunity, while
their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
mother-in-law, and speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) with so much handsome praise, so much
warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) secured to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
father, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) very kind reception of himself, as was an additional
proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knowing how to please--and of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) certainly thinking it
worth while to try to please her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did not advance a word of praise
beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but,
undoubtedly he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could know very little of the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) understood
what would be welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could be sure of little else. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father's
marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``had been the wisest measure, every friend must
rejoice in it; and the family from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received such a blessing
must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) got as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could to thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) for Miss Taylor's merits,
without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it
was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's
character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if
resolved to qualify his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) opinion completely for travelling round to its
object, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but I
confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a
very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that
I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``were you to guess her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to be _eighteen_, I should listen with
pleasure; but _she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such
words. Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) imagine that you have spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as a pretty
young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I should know better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``no, depend upon it, -LRB-with a
gallant bow,-RRB- that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom
I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my
terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from
their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind,
had ever crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) compliments were to be considered
as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must see more
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ways; at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only felt they were
agreeable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) quick
eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy
expression; and even, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might have determined not to look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was often listening.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the
entire deficiency in him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,
was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was not farther from
approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objecting
to every marriage that was arranged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never suffered beforehand from
the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not think so ill of
any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it
were proved against them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blessed the favouring blindness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could
now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a
glance forward at any possible treachery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) guest, give way to all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.
Frank Churchill's accommodation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) journey, through the sad evils
of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed
anxiety to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had certainly escaped catching cold--which,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to feel quite assured of himself till
after another night.

<p/>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must be going.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had business at the Crown about his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hay, and a great many errands for
Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) need not hurry any body else.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son,
too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity
of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore
may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with
a neighbour of yours, -LRB-turning to Emma,-RRB- a lady residing in or near
Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,
I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not
the proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any
family of that name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure we do,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bates--we passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
house--I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted
with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) at Weymouth, and a fine girl
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is. Call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), by all means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no necessity for my calling this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man;
<div class="bookquote">``another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance
at Weymouth which--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done
cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;
any want of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) _here_ should be carefully avoided. You saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) with the Campbells, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was the equal of every body she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mixed
with, but here she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough
to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The son looked convinced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speak of the acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a very
elegant young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) agreed to it, but with so quiet a <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost to
doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort
of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought
only ordinarily gifted with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were never particularly struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) manners before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``I think you will to-day. You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to advantage; see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) and
hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)--no, I am afraid you will not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) at all, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) has an
aunt who never holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Woodhouse, always the last to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) way in conversation; <div class="bookquote">``then give
me leave to assure you that you will find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) a very agreeable young
lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is staying here on a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) grandmama and aunt, very
worthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely
glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to
shew you the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your father is not going so far; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is only going to the Crown,
quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many
houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,
unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you
had best cross the street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hearty support by calling out, <div class="bookquote">``My good friend,
this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sees
it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) may get there from the Crown in a hop,
step, and jump.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a
graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained
very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now
engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full
confidence in their comfort.



<p/>CHAPTER VI


<p/>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came with Mrs.
Weston, to whom and to Highbury he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed to take very cordially. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had
been sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), it appeared, most companionably at home, till
her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,
immediately fixed on Highbury.--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) did not doubt there being very
pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) should always
chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,
would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) constant attraction.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood
for Hartfield; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) trusted to its bearing the same construction with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). They walked thither directly.

<p/>Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for
half a minute, in order to hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son was very handsome, knew
nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in
arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was wanting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) again, and especially to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in
company with Mrs. Weston, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) behaviour to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
was to depend. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) were deficient there, nothing should make amends
for it. But on seeing them together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) became perfectly satisfied. It
was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) whole manner to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)--nothing could more agreeably denote his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wish of considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as
a friend and securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) affection. And there was time enough for Emma
to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of
the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour
or two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards
in Highbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield
sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was
resolved on, confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wish to be made acquainted with the whole
village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than
Emma could have supposed.

<p/>Some of the objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
begged to be shewn the house which his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) father had lived in so long, and
which had been the home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) father's father; and on recollecting that
an old woman who had nursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was still living, walked in quest of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in
some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they
shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must
be very like a merit to those he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was with.

<p/>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it
could not be fairly supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been ever voluntarily absenting
himself; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not been acting a part, or making a parade of
insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
justice.

<p/>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though
the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses
were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any
run on the road; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) companions had not expected to be detained by
any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of
the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for
a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly
populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such
brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for
which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established
among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was immediately
interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and instead of
passing on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed
windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,
and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw no fault
in the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it
was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the
very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every
fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived
the former good old days of the room?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) who could do any thing in
Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction
that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted
to attend, were mentioned; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not satisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not be
persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw around him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), could
not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars
were given and families described, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was still unwilling to admit that
the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there
would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their
proper place the next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) argued like a young man very much bent
on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of
the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social
inclinations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of
Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of
mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could be no judge, however, of the evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was holding cheap.
It was but an effusion of lively spirits.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;
and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma
recollected his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) intended visit the day before, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had
paid it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, oh! yes'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I was just going to mention it. A very
successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much
obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken
me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I
was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes
would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and
I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--but there
was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) -LRB-finding me nowhere else-RRB- joined me there at last, that I had
been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.
The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look
ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies
can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so
pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--A most
deplorable want of complexion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's
complexion. <div class="bookquote">``It was certainly never brilliant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would not
allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and
delicacy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) face.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had
heard many people say the same--but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must confess, that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where
features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;
and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) need not
attempt to describe what the effect was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``there is no disputing about taste.--At least you
admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) except her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) complexion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) head and laughed.--<div class="bookquote">``I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
complexion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ford/Mrs. Ford</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) hastily exclaimed,
<div class="bookquote">``Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of
their lives, as my father informs me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes to Highbury himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.
If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove
myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must
buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare say
they sell gloves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will
be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because
you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your
popularity will stand upon your own virtues.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of <div class="bookquote">``Men's Beavers''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``York Tan''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
said--<div class="bookquote">``But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,
you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_
_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of
public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in
private life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
party at Weymouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a
very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree
of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account.--I
shall not commit myself by claiming more than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may chuse to allow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could do herself. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is so very
reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any
body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so
well. I met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a
little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.
Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,
warm-hearted woman. I like them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is
destined to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes---LRB-rather hesitatingly-RRB---I believe I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston smiling;
<div class="bookquote">``remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say
when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a little
farther off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly do forget to think of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``as having ever
been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.

<p/>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, <div class="bookquote">``Did
you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank
Churchill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>repeated Emma. <div class="bookquote">``You forget how much she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) belongs to
Highbury. I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) every year of our lives since we both began.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) plays charmingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who
could really judge. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared to me to play well, that is, with
considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--I am
excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right
of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s
admired; and I remember one proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being thought to play well:--a
man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman
to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down
instead--never seemed to like to hear one if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the other.
That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proof indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, highly amused.--<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Dixon is very musical,
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,
than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a
very strong proof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger
than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable
to me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear
than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.
How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) very particular friend, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor comfort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``One would rather have a stranger
preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might
not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend
always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--Poor
Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is gone to settle in Ireland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
really did not seem to feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But
be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)--quickness of friendship, or
dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt
it: Miss Fairfax herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) must have felt the improper and dangerous
distinction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that--I do not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's
sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human
being, I guess, but herself. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) continued to play whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, <div class="bookquote">``however, it is
impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it might
all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness
outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be
a better judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) character, and of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is likely to conduct
herself in critical situations, than I can be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children
and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be
intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) visited
her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a
little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take
disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always was,
by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reserve--I
never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oftentimes very
convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,
but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction
may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an
agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of
conquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss
Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think
ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>)--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual
cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea
about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to
conceal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) perfectly agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>): and after walking together so long, and
thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>),
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was
not exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected; less of the man of the world in some
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) ideas seemed more moderate--his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) feelings
warmer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was particularly struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manner of considering Mr.
Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would go and look at,
and would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not
believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for
having. If it were to be shared with the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
think any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample
room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who
wanted more.

<p/>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about.
Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many
advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be no
judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _did_ know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking
about, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in
life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might not be aware of the
inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or
a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) did perfectly feel that Enscombe
could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) happy, and that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) were attached, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) would
willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.



<p/>CHAPTER VII


<p/>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the
following day, by hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was gone off to London, merely to have
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at breakfast, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner,
but with no more important view that appeared than having his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut.
There was certainly no harm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) travelling sixteen miles twice over
on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of
plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had believed herself to discern in him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) yesterday. Vanity,
extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be
doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conduct might appear
in general; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) became liable to all these charges. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father only
called him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.
Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) passing it over as
quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that <div class="bookquote">``all young
people would have their little whims.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) visit
hitherto had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend only good ideas of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Mrs. Weston
was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) made
himself--how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw to like in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) disposition altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and
lively one; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could observe nothing wrong in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) notions, a great deal
decidedly right; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) uncle with warm regard, was fond of
talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)--said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would be the best man in the world if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) were
left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to
speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for
such an unfortunate fancy for having his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hair cut, there was nothing to
denote him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) unworthy of the distinguished honour which her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) imagination
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); the honour, if not of being really in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),
of being at least very near it, and saved only by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own
indifference---LRB-for still her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resolution held of never marrying-RRB---the
honour, in short, of being marked out for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) by all their joint
acquaintance.

<p/>Mr. Weston, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) side, added a virtue to the account which must
have some weight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to understand that Frank admired her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
extremely--thought her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) very beautiful and very charming; and with so
much to be said for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) must not judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, <div class="bookquote">``all young people would have their
little whims.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>There was one person among his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) new acquaintance in Surry, not so
leniently disposed. In general he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was judged, throughout the parishes of
Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made
for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so
often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be
softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.
The circumstance was told him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at Hartfield; for the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was
silent; but Emma heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) almost immediately afterwards say to himself,
over a newspaper he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``Hum! just the trifling, silly
fellow I took him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had half a mind to resent; but an instant's
observation convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that it was really said only to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let it pass.

<p/>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and
Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly
opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma
want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted exactly
the advice they gave.

<p/>This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in
Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and
unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,
and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,
they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little
company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had
brought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had
yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With
their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their
inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number
of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,
in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.
Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body
for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the
single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma
could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor
Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>)_ to go, if they did;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) regretted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father's known habits would be giving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) refusal less meaning than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) could wish. The Coles were very
respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not
for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit
them. This lesson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) very much feared, they would receive only from
herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks
before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>)
very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their
invitation, and none had come for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father and herself; and Mrs.
Weston's accounting for it with <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they will not take the
liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>was not quite
sufficient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should like to have had the power of
refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,
consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), occurred
again and again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might not have been tempted
to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They
had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,
and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absence. Might
not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). The bare
possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spirits; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be
intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.

<p/>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at
Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first
remark, on reading it, was that <div class="bookquote">``of course it must be declined,''  (<font color='red'><b>Westons</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so
very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to do, that their
advice for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) going was most prompt and successful.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) owned that, considering every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not absolutely
without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so
properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much
consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``They would have solicited the honour
earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from
London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of
air, and therefore induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) the more readily to give them the honour
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) company.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Upon the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very persuadable; and it being
briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be
depended on for bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked
into an acquiescence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's going out to dinner on a day now
near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). As for _his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)_
going, Emma did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to think it possible, the hours would be
too late, and the party too numerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was soon pretty well resigned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not fond of dinner-visiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``I never was. No more is
Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole
should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come
in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us
in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so
reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the
evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any
body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine
with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take
care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what
it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then turning to Mrs.
Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--<div class="bookquote">``Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not
married, you would have staid at home with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``as I took Miss Taylor away, it is
incumbent on me to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.
Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,
not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how
to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately
arranged.

<p/>With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking
as usual. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a great regard
for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). James
could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written
to Mrs. Cole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say
that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline
their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course.
But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be
done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be
wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). We have never
been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have
no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there,
you must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) at what time you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) come for you again;
and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late.
You will get very tired when tea is over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many
people talking at once. You will not like the noise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``if Emma comes away early, it will
be breaking up the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And no great harm if it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse. <div class="bookquote">``The sooner every
party breaks up, the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going
away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured
people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must
feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss
Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in
the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am
sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have
been your neighbours these _ten_ years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to
you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any
pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole
never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means
of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,
rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a
little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You
will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no
scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am
only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being
exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) loves piquet, you
know; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by
yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of
that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did, on the condition of some promises on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) side: such as that,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came home cold, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if
hungry, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would take something to eat; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own maid should
sit up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and that Serle and the butler should see that every
thing were safe in the house, as usual.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII


<p/>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's dinner
waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection
which could be concealed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came back, had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very
good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had
done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had no reason to wish his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair longer, to conceal any confusion
of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>),
Emma thus moralised to herself:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things
do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent
way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--It
depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is
_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have done this
differently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would either have gloried in the achievement, or
been ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of
a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own
vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not trifling or silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) again, and for
a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) general manners, and by
inference, of the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manners towards herself; of guessing
how soon it might be necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to throw coldness into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) air;
and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were
now seeing them together for the first time.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.
Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.
Elton, even in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) favour, none had disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.
Goddard being able to come; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) last pleasing duty, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) left
the house, was to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) respects to them as they sat together after
dinner; and while her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) father was fondly noticing the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>)
dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) power, by helping
them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever
unwilling self-denial his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) care of their constitution might have obliged
them to practise during the meal.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had provided a plentiful dinner
for them; she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) could know that they had been allowed to eat
it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see
that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,
having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and
independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could,
and not use his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had an opportunity now of speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) approbation while warm from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stopped to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is coming as you should do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``like a gentleman.--I am
quite glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), observing, <div class="bookquote">``How lucky that we should arrive at the same
moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether
you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You
might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of
consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be
beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but
with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always
observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_ you have
nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You
are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_ I shall really
be very happy to walk into the same room with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsensical girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reply, but not at all in anger.

<p/>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as
with Mr. Knightley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was received with a cordial respect which could
not but please, and given all the consequence she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could wish for.
When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of
admiration were for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), from both husband and wife; the son approached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a cheerful eagerness which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) peculiar object,
and at dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) firmly believed,
not without some dexterity on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) side.

<p/>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper
unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of
naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,
the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the
evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already,
at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be
general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could
fairly surrender all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention to the pleasantness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neighbour.
The first remote sound to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt herself obliged to attend, was
the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) that was expected to be very interesting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) listened, and found
it well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fancy,
received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had been
calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) entered the room had
been struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking
instrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the
substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of
surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) side, and explanations
on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from
Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and
niece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account,
Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could
possibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied
that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from
Colonel Campbell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One can suppose nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cole</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Cole, <div class="bookquote">``and I was only
surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,
had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as
any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse
to surprize her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cole</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>); every body who spoke on the
subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,
and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were
enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own way, and still
listen to Mrs. Cole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me
more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who
plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite
a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine
instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves
a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole,
I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the
drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little
girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of
it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not
any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old
spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to
Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) quite agreed with me; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) is so
particularly fond of music that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) could not help indulging himself
in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so
obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that
really is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure
we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse
may be prevailed with to try it this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing
more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned
to Frank Churchill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you smile?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, why do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich
and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather wonder that it was never made before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) the use of their own instrument--which must
now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a grand pianoforte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) might think it too large for Mrs.
Bates's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your
_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for
acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably
suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what
there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can
be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) must
know as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and
perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young
woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I
told you that your suspicions would guide mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the
joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you
know, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) being so warm an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) performance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had
entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions
of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either
that, after making his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) proposals to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had the misfortune
to fall in love with _her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)_, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) became conscious of a little
attachment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) side. One might guess twenty things without guessing
exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells
to Ireland. Here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) must be leading a life of privation and penance;
there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might
have passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the
months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would
be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare
say in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)'s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though
you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what
they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's
preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) friend's, I can answer for being very
decided.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) life. Did you ever hear of that?--A water
party; and by some accident she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was falling overboard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did. I was there--one of the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it
seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I should
have made some discoveries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that
Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>).--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and
alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was
half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too
general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be
observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made
discoveries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share
in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and
obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table
was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly
right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know
a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall
soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must
conclude it to come from the Campbells.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is
not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
would not have been puzzled, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) dared fix on them. I may not have
convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.
Dixon is a principal in the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings
carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed
you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as
paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.
But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it
should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in
no other light than as an offering of love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed
real; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) felt it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said no more, other subjects
took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert
succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the
usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright
silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the
other--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news,
and heavy jokes.

<p/>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other
ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own particular little friend; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not exult in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
dignity and grace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not only love the blooming sweetness and
the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,
cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so many
alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed
affection. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and
seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say
nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax
did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have been
glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the
mortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in
vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself
beloved by the husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend.

<p/>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt too much in the
secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,
and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the
subject was almost immediately introduced, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the blush of
consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush
of guilt which accompanied the name of <div class="bookquote">``my excellent friend Colonel
Campbell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested
by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and
to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish
of saying as little about it as possible, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plainly read in the
fair heroine's countenance.

<p/>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first
of the early was Frank Churchill. In he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) walked, the first and the
handsomest; and after paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) compliments en passant to Miss Bates
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) way directly to the opposite side of the circle,
where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could find a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), would
not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) object, and every body must perceive it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard
what each thought of the other. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had never seen so lovely a face, and
was delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) naivete.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Only to be sure it was paying
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) too great a compliment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) did think there were some looks a
little like Mr. Elton.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Emma restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) indignation, and only turned
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in silence.

<p/>Smiles of intelligence passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and the gentleman on first
glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated
sitting long--was always the first to move when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could--that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over
parish business--that as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had staid, however, it had been
pleasant enough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,
sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it
so abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been
used to despise the place rather too much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) as to the
society in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe,
and the sort; and could make out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) answers that, as far as
Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their
visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and
that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even
chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;
that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without
considerable address _at_ _times_, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) could get away, or introduce
an acquaintance for a night.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at
its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at
home than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) importance at Enscombe was very evident. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
aunt where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle could do nothing, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) laughing and noticing
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed -LRB-excepting one or two points-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
_with_ _time_ persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to any thing. One of those points on which
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) influence failed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then mentioned. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wanted very much to
go abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
would not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beginning to have no longer the same wish.

<p/>The unpersuadable point, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not mention, Emma guessed to be
good behaviour to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made a most wretched discovery,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), after a short pause.--
<div class="bookquote">``I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knew days fly
so fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.
But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate the
recollection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out
of so few, in having your hair cut.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that is no subject of regret at all. I have
no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be
seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself
obliged to turn from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When
Mr. Cole had moved away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention could be restored as before,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss
Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) started. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you for rousing me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I have
been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hair in so odd a
way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I never saw
any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own. I
see nobody else looking like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!--I must go and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) whether it
is an Irish fashion. Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you
shall see how she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) takes it;--whether she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) colours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) standing before Miss
Fairfax, and talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but as to its effect on the young lady,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in
front of Miss Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could absolutely distinguish nothing.

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the luxury of a large party,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>):--<div class="bookquote">``one can get near
every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk
to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like
yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how
Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece came here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?--They were invited, were not they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their
coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad
it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and
cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), though I never saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) appear to more advantage, it struck me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was heated, and
would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could
not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,
and I could get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) about the carriage. You may guess
how readily he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came into my wishes; and having his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation, I made
my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) that the carriage would be
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) comfortable at once. Good soul! she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was as grateful as possible, you
may be sure. `Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,
many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's
carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite
surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a
very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing
that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their
accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not
have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse
for assisting them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma--<div class="bookquote">``nothing more likely. I know no man more
likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing
really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not a
gallant man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane
Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>);--and for
an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on
more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had horses to-day--for we arrived
together; and I laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) about it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said not a word that
could betray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) credit for more simple,
disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss
Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never
been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable
it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane
Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Emma. <div class="bookquote">``Dear Mrs. Weston, how
could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley must not
marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no,
no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's
marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you
should think of such a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want
the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea has
been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to
marry, you would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) refrain on Henry's account, a boy of six
years old, who knows nothing of the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr.
Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt
it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has always been a first favourite with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), as you very well
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the imprudence of such a match!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than
what you mention. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good-nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) humanity, as I tell you, would
be quite enough to account for the horses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has a great regard for the
Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to
shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.
You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,
no;--every feeling revolts. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own sake, I would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) do so
mad a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,
and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has not the
least idea of it. Do not put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) head. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) marry?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
is as happy as possible by himself; with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) farm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sheep, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) library, and all the parish to manage; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is extremely fond of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother's children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has no occasion to marry, either to fill up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) time or his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Emma, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thinks so, it is so; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) really loves
Jane Fairfax--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would do any good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) family; but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps the greatest good he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could
do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>``If it would be good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), I am sure it would be evil to himself; a
very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) bear to have Miss
Bates belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--To have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) haunting the Abbey, and thanking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) all day long for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) great kindness in marrying Jane?--`So very
kind and obliging!--But he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always had been such a very kind neighbour!'
And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother's old
petticoat. `Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still
it would last a great while--and, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must thankfully say that
their petticoats were all very strong.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). You divert me against my conscience.
And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed
by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) might talk on; and
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to say any thing himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would only talk louder, and
drown her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad
connexion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wishes it; and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does. I have
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The
interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) takes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) health--his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) concern that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) should have no happier prospect! I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) express himself
so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) performance on the
pianoforte, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) voice! I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could listen
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred
to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though
we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the
Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is just the person to do it, even without being in
love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it can be no argument to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is in love. But I do not
think it is at all a likely thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to do. Mr. Knightley does
nothing mysteriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) lamenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) having no instrument repeatedly; oftener
than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of
things, occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had intended to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong
notion that it comes from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was particularly silent when
Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have
many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment--I
believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that
Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather
gaining ground over the mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most
used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them
that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same
moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the
honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
conversation with Mrs. Weston, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been seeing nothing, except that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) very
pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to
lead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a very proper compliance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew the limitations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own powers too well to attempt more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could perform with credit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted neither taste nor spirit in
the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own voice well. One accompaniment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) song took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agreeably by
surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual
followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect
knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) knew nothing
of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang
together once more; and Emma would then resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) place to Miss
Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never could
attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own.

<p/>With mixed feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seated herself at a little distance from the
numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.
They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the
sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half
Emma's mind; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell into a train of thinking on the subject of
Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices
gave only momentary interruptions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) objections to Mr. Knightley's
marrying did not in the least subside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could see nothing but evil
in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;
consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most
mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great
deduction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could
not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.
Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never
marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.

<p/>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). They
talked at first only of the performance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) admiration was certainly
very warm; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). As a sort of touchstone, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answer was in
the spirit of cutting the matter short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed it to indicate only
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I often feel concern,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I dare not make our carriage
more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but
you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to
for such a purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
replied;--<div class="bookquote">``but you must often wish it, I am sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) smiled with
such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must proceed another
step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This present from the Campbells,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``this pianoforte is very
kindly given.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied, and without the smallest apparent
embarrassment.--<div class="bookquote">``But they would have done better had they given
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not
enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have
expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>From that moment, Emma could have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) oath that Mr. Knightley had
had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were
entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual
preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's
second song, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) voice grew thick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), when it was finished, thinking aloud--<div class="bookquote">``you have
sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Another song, however, was soon begged for. <div class="bookquote">``One more;--they would not
fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>And Frank Churchill was heard to say, <div class="bookquote">``I think you could manage this
without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the
song falls on the second.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley grew angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``thinks of nothing but shewing off
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own voice. This must not be.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And touching Miss Bates, who at that
moment passed near--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing
herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bates, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to
be grateful, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) stept forward and put an end to all farther
singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse
and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon -LRB-within
five minutes-RRB- the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew
where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every
thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,
capital in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible
waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to
Emma, had secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) up to the top.

<p/>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,
Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was receiving on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.
Knightley. This would be a trial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was no dancer in general. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur
something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was talking to Mrs.
Cole--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was still talking to Mrs. Cole.

<p/>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) interest was yet safe; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than
five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of
it made it very delightful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found herself well matched in a
partner. They were a couple worth looking at.

<p/>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was
growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mother's
account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again,
they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attended Emma to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) carriage. <div class="bookquote">``I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) languid dancing
would not have agreed with me, after yours.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX


<p/>Emma did not repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) condescension in going to the Coles. The visit
afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must
be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must have delighted
the Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a
name behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that would not soon die away.

<p/>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two
points on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not quite easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not
transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspicions of
Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it
had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) submission
to all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) told, was a compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) penetration, which made
it difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be quite certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought to have held her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
tongue.

<p/>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and
there she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had no doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the
inferiority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own playing and singing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did most heartily
grieve over the idleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) childhood--and sat down and practised
vigorously an hour and a half.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise
could have satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might soon have been comforted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'s,
than a lamp is like sunshine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite
as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body
last night said how well you played.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The
truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,
but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) does, or
that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole
said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal
about your taste, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) valued taste much more than execution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure? I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had execution, but I did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had any
taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is no
understanding a word of it. Besides, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) does play so very well, you
know, it is no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is obliged to do, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) will have to
teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would get into
any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as they always do--very vulgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They told me something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet rather hesitatingly; <div class="bookquote">``but it is
nothing of any consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), though fearful of its
producing Mr. Elton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to their father upon some business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to stay to
dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They talked a great deal about him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), especially Anne Cox. I do not know
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) meant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) asked me if I thought I should go and stay there
again next summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was very agreeable the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) dined there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cox</b></font>) at
dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar
girls in Highbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present state, would be dangerous.

<p/>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always
very long at a purchase; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was still hanging over muslins
and changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could
not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.
Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the
office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a
stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
could presume to expect; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes fell only on the butcher with
his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) full
basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling
children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough
still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with
seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons
appeared; Mrs. Weston and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son-in-law; they were walking into
Highbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the
first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer
Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their
eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and the
agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to
the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was going to call
on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my companion tells me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I absolutely promised Miss
Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it
myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) says I did, I
am going now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And while Mrs. Weston pays her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) visit, I may be allowed, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said
Frank Churchill, <div class="bookquote">``to join your party and wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at Hartfield--if
you are going home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston was disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the
way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not want me. My aunt always
sends me off when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is shopping. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) says I fidget her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to death; and
Miss Woodhouse looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could almost say the same. What am I to
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am here on no business of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``I am only waiting for
my friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.
But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if you advise it.--But -LRB-with a smile-RRB- if Colonel Campbell should
have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an
indifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.
Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be
palatable through her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world
at a civil falsehood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe any such thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma.--<div class="bookquote">``I am persuaded that
you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but
there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite
otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``if it be not very disagreeable to
you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.
We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It
will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>),
returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,
and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all
the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted plain
muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be
it ever so beautiful, would still never match her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) yellow pattern. At
last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma’am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ford/Mrs. Ford</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs.
Ford.--<div class="bookquote">``Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at
Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,
Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown
home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go
to Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,
Mrs. Ford, could not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two
parcels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No trouble in the world, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ford/Mrs. Ford</b></font>)</div>said the obliging Mrs. Ford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you
please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, I
think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and
take it home with me at night. What do you advise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,
if you please, Mrs. Ford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that will be much best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, quite satisfied, <div class="bookquote">``I should
not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.
Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter, <div class="bookquote">``I am just run across to
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,
and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How
do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston
to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;
and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad
to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!
then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me
just to run across and entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to come in; my mother will be so
very happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--and now we are such a nice party, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot
refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, `Miss Woodhouse's
opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall
be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--`Oh,' said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), `wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you
believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is, in the most obliging manner in
the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet
came out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had
no use of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every
body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said
so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,
but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,
then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came
to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,
Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your
mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis
sent them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the
Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be
uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing
but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value
of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?
Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) really eats
nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened
if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eats--so I
say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the
middle of the day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gets hungry, and there is nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) likes so
well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took
the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often
heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only
way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We
have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent
apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these
ladies will oblige us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma would be <div class="bookquote">``very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>and they did at
last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane
came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a
little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was I talking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), beginning again when they were all in
the street.

<p/>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would fix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's
spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! `Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>),
`I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind
excessively.'--Which you know shewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to be so very... Indeed I must
say that, much as I had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) before and much as I had expected,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very far exceeds any thing... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,
most warmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seems every thing the fondest parent could...
`Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), `I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort
excessively.' I never shall forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manner. And when I brought out
the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very
obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) directly, `there is nothing
in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking
home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so
very... And I am sure, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they
are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only
we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us
promise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so
good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest
sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.
Knightley's most liberal supply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sends us a sack every year; and
certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
trees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was
always famous in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) younger days. But I was really quite shocked the
other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating
these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) enjoyed
them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. `I
am sure you must be,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), `and I will send you another supply; for
I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me
keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,
before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) would not--for really
as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great
many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept
for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) should be sending us more,
so liberal as he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) had been already; and Jane said the same. And when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say
quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite
distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wished
I had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,
I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William
Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of
apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down
and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.
William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>). But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it
was all the apples of _that_ sort his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had brought them
all--and now his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had not one left to bake or boil. William did
not seem to mind it himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was so pleased to think his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had
sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master's profit
than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, was quite displeased at their
being all sent away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) could not bear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) master should not be
able to have another apple-tart this spring. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) told Patty this, but bid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for
Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks
were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told
me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley
know any thing about it for the world! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would be so very... I wanted
to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it
before I was aware.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) visitors
walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,
pursued only by the sounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) desultory good-will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take
care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker
and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss
Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss
Smith, the step at the turning.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X


<p/>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was
tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) usual employment,
slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), most deedily occupied about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,
standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) back to them, intent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) pianoforte.

<p/>Busy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy
countenance on seeing Emma again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in rather a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``coming at least
ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be
useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``have not you finished it yet? you would not
earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not been working uninterruptedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I have been
assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) instrument stand steadily,
it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see
we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be
persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contrived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should be seated by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and was sufficiently
employed in looking out the best baked apple for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and trying to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) help or advise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready
to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was not immediately ready,
Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nerves; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not yet
possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not
but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve
never to expose them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neighbour again.

<p/>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the
powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.
Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma
joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper
discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, with a
smile at Emma, <div class="bookquote">``the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of
Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper
notes I am sure is exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) and _all_ _that_ _party_ would
particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) either gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you
think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane did not look round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had
been speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at the same moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, in a whisper; <div class="bookquote">``mine was a random guess. Do
not distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) head with a smile, and looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had very little
doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) began again,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this
occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder
which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to
hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going
forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence
of an immediate commission from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) may have sent only
a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon
contingencies and conveniences?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) paused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not but hear; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not avoid answering,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), in a voice of
forced calmness, <div class="bookquote">``I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be
all conjecture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one
conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this
rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard
at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their
tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss
Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the
pleasure, madam, -LRB-to Mrs. Bates,-RRB- of restoring your spectacles, healed
for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a
little from the latter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss
Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it will be one of the waltzes we
danced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them
as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we
danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one ever
has to give--for another half-hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) played.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one
happy!--If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something
else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning
to Emma, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here
are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might
expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of
Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knew Miss Fairfax could have no music
here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to
have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing
incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;
and when on glancing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eye towards Jane Fairfax she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) caught the remains
of a smile, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness,
there had been a smile of secret delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had less scruple in the
amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).--This
amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very
reprehensible feelings.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) brought all the music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), and they looked it over together.--Emma
took the opportunity of whispering,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak too plain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) must understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) does. I would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) understand me. I am not in the least
ashamed of my meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now
a key to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) does
wrong, she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) ought to feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is not entirely without it, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not see much sign of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this
moment--_his (<font color='blue'><b>Adair</b></font>)_ favourite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.
Knightley on horse-back not far off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adair</b></font>) if possible, just to
thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Adair</b></font>). I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;
but I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Adair</b></font>) will come
in when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adair</b></font>) knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet
so!--Our little room so honoured!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was in the adjoining chamber while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) still spoke, and opening the
casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every
syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as
if it had passed within the same apartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d’ ye do?--how d’ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you
for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready
for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, but
particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) caught no cold
last night. How is she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would hear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave
Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head in
steady scepticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>resumed Miss Bates.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) short with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
wanted something from Kingston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?--Miss
Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.
Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), in a deliberating manner, <div class="bookquote">``for five minutes, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;
so many friends!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on
to Kingston as fast as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the
pianoforte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last
night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not
it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any
thing equal to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss
Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.
And -LRB-raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) voice still more-RRB- I do not see why Miss Fairfax should
not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.
Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception,
in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say
something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to
hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--so
shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had
a great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!
Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You
should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) is off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) never
can bear to be thanked. But I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) would have staid now, and it
would have been a pity not to have mentioned... Well, -LRB-returning to the
room,-RRB- I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is
going to Kingston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) asked me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could do any thing...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``we heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) kind offers, we heard every thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was
open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must
have heard every thing to be sure. `Can I do any thing for you at
Kingston?' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); so I just mentioned... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you
be going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted
long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived
to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) companion taking leave also, could
allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield
gates, before they set off for Randalls.



<p/>CHAPTER XI


<p/>It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been
known of young people passing many, many months successively, without
being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue
either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the
felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--it
must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.

<p/>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;
and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded
to spend with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young
people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the
difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.
But still she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had inclination enough for shewing people again how
delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--for
doing that in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) need not blush to compare herself with Jane
Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked
aids of vanity--to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first in pacing out the room they were in
to see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensions
of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that
Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little
the largest.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's
should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,
and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.
Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston
most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;
and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who
there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space
to every couple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss
Coxes five,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had been repeated many times over. <div class="bookquote">``And there will be the
two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.
Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and
Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five
couple there will be plenty of room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But soon it came to be on one side,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think
there will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On another,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to
stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.
It will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the
thought of the moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) brother's, and
must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert
would have danced the other evening, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had been asked. A word was
put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family
of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance
who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple
would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what
possible manner they could be disposed of.

<p/>The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. <div class="bookquote">``Might not
they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It seemed the
best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a
better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about
the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of
health. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be
persevered in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not
bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would catch a dreadful cold.
So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would
be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do
not let them talk of it. That young man -LRB-speaking lower-RRB- is very
thoughtless. Do not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, but that young man is not quite
the thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been opening the doors very often this evening,
and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not think of the
draught. I do not mean to set you against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not
quite the thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew the importance of
it, and said every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) power to do it away. Every door was now
closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only
in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on
Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before
had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured
to be made out quite enough for ten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were too magnificent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We allowed unnecessary room. Ten
couple may stand here very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma demurred. <div class="bookquote">``It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be
worse than dancing without space to turn in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gravely replied; <div class="bookquote">``it was very bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) went on
measuring, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) ended with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful
to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be
dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no denying it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I agree with you exactly. A crowd
in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures
in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, having
proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be
a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that--I am
rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma perceived that the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gallantry was a little
self-willed, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of
dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took the compliment, and forgave the rest.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) intended ever to _marry_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), it might have been worth while to
pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) preference,
and the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) temper; but for all the purposes of their
acquaintance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was quite amiable enough.

<p/>Before the middle of the next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was at Hartfield; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) entered
the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of
the scheme. It soon appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came to announce an improvement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) almost immediately began, <div class="bookquote">``your inclination
for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors
of my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a
thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted
upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances
of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the
Crown Inn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Crown!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,
my father hopes his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends will be so kind as to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) there.
Better accommodations, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can promise them, and not a less grateful
welcome than at Randalls. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no
objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.
Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls
rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you
were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_
to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you
consent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.
Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for
myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could
be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully
comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were
necessary to make it acceptable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much
worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;
never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they
had better dance at Randalls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) had never been in the room at the Crown
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a
very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to observe, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, <div class="bookquote">``that one of the
great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger
of any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at
Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but
nobody else could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, <div class="bookquote">``you are very much mistaken
if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is
extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how
the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no
occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it
is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon
heated bodies, which -LRB-as you well know, sir-RRB- does the mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of
opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never
heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither
your father nor Mrs. Weston -LRB-poor Miss Taylor that was-RRB- would suffer
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a
window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have
often known it done myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I
live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,
this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it
over--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One
cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so
obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what
can be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>interrupted Emma, <div class="bookquote">``there will be plenty of time for talking every
thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at
the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be
so near their own stable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever
complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could
be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be
trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>), even by sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be
under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who
is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many
years ago, when I had the measles? `If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to
wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I
heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor
little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have
been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) came four times a day
for a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which
was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope
whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will send for
Perry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank
Churchill, <div class="bookquote">``examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there
and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you
might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was
desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to
them, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing
satisfactorily without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father,
engaging to think it all over while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was gone, the two young people
set off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.
Weston; delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation, very busy and
very happy in their different way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), in some little distress; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
finding every thing perfect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places
you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and
forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you are too particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``What does all that
signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as
clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our
club-nights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, <div class="bookquote">``Men never know
when things are dirty or not;''  (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div>and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.
It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,
suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was
the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted
as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary
by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable
supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the
purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward
passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.
Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;
and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being
miserably crowded at supper.

<p/>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,
&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched
suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was
pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and
Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) then took another line of
expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through
the passage, was calling out,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a
mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``one could know which arrangement our guests
in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing
must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>cried Frank, <div class="bookquote">``very true. You want your neighbours'
opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief
of them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call
upon them? Or Miss Bates? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is still nearer.--And I do not know
whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of
the rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.
Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, <div class="bookquote">``if you think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) will be of any use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
will be all delight and gratitude, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) will tell you nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting
Miss Bates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing
Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) decided approbation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at
once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer
person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates.
We are growing a little too nice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a standing lesson of how to be
happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both sir! Can the old lady?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great
blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.
Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
away he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ran.

<p/>Long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and
a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it
much less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here
ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at
least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and
chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left
as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.
Stokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already
written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) fortnight,
which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to
be.

<p/>Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) agree that it must.
As a counsellor she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was not wanted; but as an approver, -LRB-a much safer
character,-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was truly welcome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) approbation, at once general
and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another
half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,
some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the
future. The party did not break up without Emma's being positively
secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has asked her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), my
dear. That's right. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would!''



 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XII


<p/>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely
satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted
term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's
confidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not think it so very impossible that the
Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
fortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take
their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were
entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and
hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion, the great risk, of
its being all in vain.

<p/>Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.
All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude
generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking
indifference about it. Either because he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not dance himself, or
because the plan had been formed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being consulted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
seemed resolved that it should not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), determined against its
exciting any present curiosity, or affording him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) any future amusement.
To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,
than,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this
trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say
against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes,
I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as
I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's
week's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing
dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who
does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.
Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very
different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>This Emma felt was aimed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quite angry. It was not
in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was so indifferent, or so
indignant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not guided by _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)_ feelings in reprobating the ball,
for _she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) animated--open hearted--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) voluntarily said;--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.
What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with
_very_ great pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have preferred
the society of William Larkins. No!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was more and more convinced
that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great
deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) side--but no
love.

<p/>Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two
days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of
every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew's
instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been in a very suffering state -LRB-so said her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband-RRB-
when writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew two days before, though from her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) usual
unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not mentioned it; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was too ill to trifle,
and must entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to set off for Enscombe without delay.

<p/>The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.
Weston, instantly. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) going, it was inevitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) must be gone
within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) aunt,
to lessen his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) repugnance. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) illnesses; they never occurred but
for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own convenience.

<p/>Mrs. Weston added, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could only allow himself time to hurry to
Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could suppose to feel any interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might be
expected at Hartfield very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it had
been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The
loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man
might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening as
it would have been!--Every body so happy! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner the
happiest!--<div class="bookquote">``I said it would be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the only consolation.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's feelings were quite distinct. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought principally of
Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was treated; and as
for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they
would all be safer at home.

<p/>Emma was ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visitor some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) appeared; but if this
reflected at all upon his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) impatience, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sorrowful look and total want
of spirits when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did come might redeem him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt the going away
almost too much to speak of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) dejection was most evident. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing
himself, it was only to say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will come again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``This will not be your only visit
to Randalls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!---LRB-shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head-RRB---the uncertainty of when I may be able to
return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of
all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this
spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--I am afraid it
is a custom gone for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our poor ball must be quite given up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the
pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,
foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh! Miss Woodhouse,
why are you always so right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much
rather have been merry than wise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends
on it. Do not forget your engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma looked graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a fortnight as it has been!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``every day more
precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making
me less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at
Highbury!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you do us such ample justice now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``I will
venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?
Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure
you did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in
coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma
was convinced that it had been so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you must be off this very morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I
must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss
Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have
strengthened yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It
was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained
by Miss Bates's being absent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was out; and I felt it impossible not
to wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a woman that one may, that one _must_
laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my
visit, then'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hesitated, got up, walked to a window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In short,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be
quite without suspicion'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as if wanting to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hardly knew
what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely
serious, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in
the hope of putting it by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) calmly said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,
then'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); probably reflecting
on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had said, and trying to understand the manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sigh. It was natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had _cause_ to sigh.
He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>). A few awkward moments
passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to
Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was more
in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might
have ended, if his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) father had not made his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) appearance? Mr. Woodhouse
soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) composed.

<p/>A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.
Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of
procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that
was doubtful, said, <div class="bookquote">``It was time to go;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>and the young man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall hear about you all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that is my chief consolation.
I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged
Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has been so kind as to promise
it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really
interested in the absent!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will tell me every thing. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) letters
I shall be at dear Highbury again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>closed the
speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been
the notice--short their meeting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) was gone; and Emma felt so sorry
to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>)
absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too
much.

<p/>It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>)
arrival. Certainly his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) being at Randalls had given great spirit to
the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation
of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) which every morning had brought, the assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>)
attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) liveliness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) manners! It had been a very happy
fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common
course of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) had
_almost_ told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). What strength, or what constancy of
affection he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) might be subject to, was another point; but at present
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious
preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) _must_ be a little in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>), in spite of
every previous determination against it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly must,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This sensation of listlessness,
weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,
this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--
I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I
were not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to
others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank
Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) may spend the evening
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) dear William Larkins now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was sorry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own account; his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very cheerful look would have
contradicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said, and very steadily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable
kindness added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out
of luck; you are very much out of luck!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some days before she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) honest
regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) composure
was odious. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from
headache to a degree, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) aunt declare, that had the ball
taken place, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was
charity to impute some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unbecoming indifference to the languor of
ill-health.



<p/>CHAPTER XIII


<p/>Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being in love. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas
only varied as to the how much. At first, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it was a good
deal; and afterwards, but little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had great pleasure in hearing
Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sake, greater pleasure than ever
in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was very often thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), and
quite impatient for a letter, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) might know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, how were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits, how was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt, and what was the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming to
Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could not admit
herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed
for employment than usual; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was still busy and cheerful; and,
pleasing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could yet imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to have faults; and
farther, though thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) so much, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sat drawing or
working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close
of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing
elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
side was that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) _refused_ _him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)_. Their affection was always to subside
into friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their
parting; but still they were to part. When she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) became sensible of this,
it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could not be very much in love; for in spite of
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) previous and fixed determination never to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) father, never
to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle
than she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could foresee in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is
there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not
really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will
not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I
should be sorry to be more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was equally contented with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) view of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very
much in love indeed!--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) comes again, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) affection
continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most
inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I
imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) can think I have been encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) hitherto. No, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
had believed me at all to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feelings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not have been
so wretched. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) have thought himself encouraged, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looks and
language at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I must
be on my guard. This is in the supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) attachment continuing
what it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) steadiness or constancy.--His (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) feelings are warm, but I can imagine
them rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short,
makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I
shall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be a
good thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,
and I shall have been let off easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
at first shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own sensations, and think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving
the particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) journey and of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feelings, expressing all the
affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable,
and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed
attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of
apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.
Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast
between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was
just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more
might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than
once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a
compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) taste, or a remembrance of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had said; and in
the very last time of its meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eye, unadorned as it was by any
such broad wreath of gallantry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) yet could discern the effect of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all
conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these
words--<div class="bookquote">``I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss
Woodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was
remembered only from being _her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)_ friend. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) information and prospects
as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;
Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dared not yet, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.

<p/>Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material
part, its sentiments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) yet found, when it was folded up and returned
to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could
still do without the writer, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) must learn to do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) intentions were unchanged. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) resolution of refusal only grew more
interesting by the addition of a scheme for his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) subsequent consolation
and happiness. His (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) recollection of Harriet, and the words which
clothed it, the <div class="bookquote">``beautiful little friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the
idea of Harriet's succeeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) affections. Was it
impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) inferior in
understanding; but he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been very much struck with the loveliness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) face and the warm simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manner; and all the
probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) favour.--For
Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must not dwell upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``I must not think of it. I know
the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have
happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it
will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested
friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it
might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter
was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's
engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest
had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's
disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible
form.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wedding-day was named. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would soon be among them again; Mr.
Elton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter
from Enscombe before <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) bride''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>was in every body's
mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's
mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.
With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of
insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had
not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual
approach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.

<p/>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could
give. Emma felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not do too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that Harriet had
a right to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ingenuity and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) patience; but it was heavy work
to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed
to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened
submissively, and said <div class="bookquote">``it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse
described--it was not worth while to think about them--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would not
think about them any longer''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>but no change of subject could avail, and
the next half-hour saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as anxious and restless about the Eltons as
before. At last Emma attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on another ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.
Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.
You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.
It was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure
you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will
be a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of
forgetting it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager
exclamation. Emma continued,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk
less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I
would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my
comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your
duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of
others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.
These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very
important--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act
upon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.
I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes
have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what
would be kind by me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>This appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affections did more than all the rest. The idea of
wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) really
loved extremely, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wretched for a while, and when the violence
of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to
what was right and support her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in it very tolerably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want
gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do
for you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and
manner could do, made Emma feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never loved Harriet so
well, nor valued her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) affection so highly before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) afterwards to
herself. <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness
of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the
clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It
is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally
beloved--which gives Isabella all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) popularity.--I have it not--but
I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the
charm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not change
you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female
breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a
hundred such--And for a wife--a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable. I
mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV


<p/>Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be
interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and
it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to
settle whether she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or
not pretty at all.

<p/>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolve on not being the last to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) respects; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made a
point of Harriet's going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that the worst of the business might
be gone through as soon as possible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to
lace up her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts
would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was
not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit
was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation
of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to
form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the
nothing-meaning terms of being <div class="bookquote">``elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not really like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not be in a hurry to find fault,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there
was too much ease. Her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) person was rather good; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) face not unpretty;
but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma
thought at least it would turn out so.

<p/>As for Mr. Elton, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manners did not appear--but no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not
permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manners. It was an
awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man
had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman
was better off; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the
privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own good sense to
depend on; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.
Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had just
married, the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had
been expected to marry, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to have the right to look as
little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as
could be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, when they had quitted the
house, and after waiting in vain for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend to begin; <div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss
Woodhouse, -LRB-with a gentle sigh,-RRB- what do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)?--Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
very charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beautiful, quite beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all surprized that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have fallen in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>returned Harriet, sighing again, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very
much attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman
who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this
the best offer she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) was likely to have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``and well she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) might, nobody could ever
have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss
Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is just as
superior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different
thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and
admire him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now without any great misery. To know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not thrown
himself away, is such a comfort!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) does seem a charming young woman,
just what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserves. Happy creature! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) `Augusta.' How
delightful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could then see
more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had a quarter
of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly
attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that
Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and
thinking much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own importance; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) meant to shine and be very
superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert
and familiar; that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) notions were drawn from one set of people,
and one style of living; that if not foolish she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was ignorant, and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.

<p/>Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have connected him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it
might be fairly supposed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) easy conceit, had been the best of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the
alliance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) place and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) carriages were the pride of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>).

<p/>The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, <div class="bookquote">``My brother
Mr. Suckling's seat;'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The
grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was
modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed
by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could see or
imagine. <div class="bookquote">``Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was quite struck by the
likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room
at Maple Grove; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister's favourite room.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Elton was appealed
to.--<div class="bookquote">``Was not it astonishingly like?--She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could really almost fancy
herself at Maple Grove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the
staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really
could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very
delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to
as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! -LRB-with a little
sigh of sentiment-RRB-. A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who
sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.
Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will
understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like
what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of
matrimony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma made as slight a reply as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could; but it was fully sufficient
for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the
grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.
The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand
very much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse
of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in
mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People
who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing
in the same style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a great idea that
people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the
extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack
an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you
have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you
know. Surry is the garden of England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many
counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as
Surry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I fancy not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.
<div class="bookquote">``I never heard any county but Surry called so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was silenced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer
at farthest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Elton; <div class="bookquote">``and that will be our time for
exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare
say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four
perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_ carriage,
we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They
would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the
year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their
bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.
When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss
Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.
Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston
twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their
first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind
here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we
are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home
than engage in schemes of pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can
be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple
Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) has been going to Bristol,
`I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must
go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau
without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own good-will,
would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said so;
and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,
when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very
bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in
a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I
perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse---LRB-looking
towards Mr. Woodhouse-RRB-, Your father's state of health must be a great
drawback. Why does not he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) try Bath?--Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should. Let me recommend
Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any
benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,
does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the
waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath
life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,
that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,
which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its
recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell
on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally
understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived
so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best
society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of
acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have
always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any
attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public
with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an
_introduction_--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) going into public under the auspices of a friend
of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the
help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss
Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could have
given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; <div class="bookquote">``but their going to Bath was
quite out of the question; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>) was not perfectly convinced that
the place might suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>) better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>) father.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>And then, to prevent
farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,
a lady's character generally precedes her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>); and Highbury has long known
that you are a superior performer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior
performer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial
a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of
music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid
of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is
_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play
delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,
comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got
into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to
me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at
Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I
honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) was speaking of my future
home, and expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) fears lest the retirement of it should be
disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had
been accustomed to--of course he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) was not wholly without apprehension.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_
_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of
retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was
not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had
no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite
independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I
really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any
sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every
luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that two carriages were not
necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. `But,' said I,
`to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a
musical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life
would be a blank to me.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Elton would hesitate
to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and
I hope you will not find he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has outstepped the truth more than may be
pardoned, in consideration of the motive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to
find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little
concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a
musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.
Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall
not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be
particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in
practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against
them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,
surely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,
I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the
instrument--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.
Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.
Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my
word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with
Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has
many things to call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attention. I believe I was half an hour this
morning shut up with my housekeeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But every thing of that kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``will soon be in so regular a
train--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Elton, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``we shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so determined upon neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) music, had nothing
more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been calling at Randalls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and found them both at
home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.
Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite
with me already, I assure you. And _she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)_ appears so truly good--there is
something so motherly and kind-hearted about her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), that it wins upon one
directly. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was your governess, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly
waited for the affirmative before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) so very
lady-like! But she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is really quite the gentlewoman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Weston's manners,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``were always particularly good.
Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest
model for any young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who do you think came in while we were there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and
how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) possibly guess?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knightley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Elton; <div class="bookquote">``Knightley himself!--Was not it
lucky?--for, not being within when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) called the other day, I had never
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,
I had a great curiosity. `My friend Knightley' had been so often
mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and I must do my
caro sposo the justice to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) need not be ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) friend.
Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very much. Decidedly, I
think, a very gentleman-like man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could
breathe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Insufferable woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediate exclamation. <div class="bookquote">``Worse than I had
supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have
believed it. Knightley!--never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life before, and call
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) Knightley!--and discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is a gentleman! A little upstart,
vulgar being, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Mr. E., and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) _caro_ _sposo_, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
resources, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.
Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) will return the compliment, and discover her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be a lady. I could
not have believed it! And to propose that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and I should unite to
form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.
Weston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a
gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) equal. Much beyond
my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank
Churchill say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were here? How angry and how diverted he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
would be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) directly. Always the first
person to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes
as regularly into my mind!'' (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>All this ran so glibly through her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, that by the time her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father
had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was
ready to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very tolerably capable of attending.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deliberately began, <div class="bookquote">``considering we never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
was very much pleased with you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) speaks a little too quick. A little
quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe
I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and
poor Miss Taylor. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved
young lady, and no doubt will make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a very good wife. Though I think
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not
having been able to wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I
said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought to
have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews
what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage
Lane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
if possible. It was being very deficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why
should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to
be no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you
make so much of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always
wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,
is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)_. A bride, you
know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who
they may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what
is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to
such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere
common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any
encouragement to people to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma had done. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father was growing nervous, and could not understand
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long,
did they occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XV


<p/>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ill
opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) observation had been pretty correct. Such as
Mrs. Elton appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) on this second interview, such she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) appeared
whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,
and ill-bred. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had a little beauty and a little accomplishment,
but so little judgment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) thought herself coming with superior
knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;
and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.
Elton's consequence only could surpass.

<p/>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed not merely happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but proud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had the air
of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury,
as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,
following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted
that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) professed
herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise
passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss
Woodhouse, who readily continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) first contribution and talked with
a good grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) being <div class="bookquote">``very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had appeared at
first. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the
little encouragement which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) proposals of intimacy met with, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) drew
back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and
though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was
necessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manners, too--and Mr.
Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and
negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the
sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very
much.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been
an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own share in the story, under
a colouring the least favourable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and the most soothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>),
had in all likelihood been given also. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, of course, the object
of their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must be
always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which
they dared not shew in open disrespect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), found a broader vent in
contemptuous treatment of Harriet.

<p/>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not
merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to
recommend the other, but from the very first; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not satisfied
with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without
solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be wanting to assist and
befriend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).--Before Emma had forfeited her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) confidence, and about the
third time of their meeting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry
on the subject.--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave
about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and
ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has very
extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) plays extremely
well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,
I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--And her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) situation is so calculated
to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour
to do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). We must bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) forward. Such talent as hers
must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those
charming lines of the poet,

<p/>`Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
`And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'

<p/>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think there is any danger of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>was Emma's calm answer--<div class="bookquote">``and
when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and
understand what her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I
have no idea that you will suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) talents can be unknown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is now in such retirement, such
obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) may have enjoyed
with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) feels it.
I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) does. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is very timid and silent. One can see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
feels the want of encouragement. I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) the better for it. I
must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for
timidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those
who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure
you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more
than I can express.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of
Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) longer
than yourself, can shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) any other attention than'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to
act. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will
follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_
have carriages to fetch and convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) home, and _we_ live in a style
which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the
least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to
send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_
than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of
thing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been
used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the
other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple
Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not
at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my
resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--I shall certainly have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) very often at my house, shall introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) wherever I can, shall
have musical parties to draw out her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) talents, and shall be constantly
on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very
extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) shortly.--I shall introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), of course, very particularly to my
brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
extremely; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gets a little acquainted with them, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fears
will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners
of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) very often
indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a
seat for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Jane Fairfax!'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--thought Emma.--<div class="bookquote">``You have not deserved this. You
may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment
beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs.
Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not suppose
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour,
there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively
addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a <div class="bookquote">``dear Miss
Woodhouse.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular
friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active
patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general
way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for
Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless
simplicity and warmth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) worthies--the
most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and
condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize
was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs.
Elton as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) walking with the Eltons,
sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was
astonishing!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not have believed it possible that the taste or
the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as
the Vicarage had to offer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is a riddle, quite a riddle!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``To chuse to remain here
month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the
mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) conversation,
rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
with such real, generous affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells
were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had
promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh
invitations had arrived for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to join them there. According to Miss
Bates--it all came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.
Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends
contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had
declined it!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing
this invitation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>was Emma's conclusion. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) must be under some sort
of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great
fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is _not_ to be
with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before
the few who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this
apology for Jane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,
my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt is a
good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We
must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste for
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) goes to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, Mrs. Weston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley warmly, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.
Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) have chosen with whom to associate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not have chosen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). But -LRB-with a reproachful smile at Emma-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) receives attentions from
Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a momentary glance; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
was herself struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) warmth. With a faint blush, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) presently
replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather
disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should
have imagined any thing but inviting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``if Miss Fairfax were to have
been drawn on beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own inclination, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) aunt's eagerness in
accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). Poor Miss Bates may
very likely have committed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) into a greater
appearance of intimacy than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own good sense would have dictated, in
spite of the very natural wish of a little change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Both felt rather anxious to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) speak again; and after a few
minutes silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton does
not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speaks _of_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). We all know the
difference between the pronouns he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and thou, the plainest spoken
amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common
civility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more
early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we
may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.
And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be
sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) superiority both of mind
and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with all the
respect which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably
never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) acknowledging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own comparative littleness in action, if
not in consciousness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. Little Henry
was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
irresolute what else to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``any body may know how highly I think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon
stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hurried
on--<div class="bookquote">``And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it
is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thick
leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or
some other cause, brought the colour into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answered,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me
a hint of it six weeks ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stopped.--Emma felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not
herself know what to think. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare
say, would not have me if I were to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)--and I am very sure I shall
never ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased
enough to exclaim,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed hardly to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was thoughtful--and in a manner which
shewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not pleased, soon afterwards said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now,
meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any
idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest
wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come
in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reverie was, <div class="bookquote">``No,
Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will ever take
me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in that way, I assure
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And soon afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``Jane Fairfax is a very charming young
woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has a fault. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has
not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a fault. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) gave me a quiet hint; I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) was mistaken;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or
wittier than his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) neighbours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and
wittier than all the world! I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speaks of the Coles--what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) calls them! How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) find any appellation for them, deep enough
in familiar vulgarity? She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) calls you, Knightley--what can she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) do for
Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) civilities and consents to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). Mrs. Weston, your argument
weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation
of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of
Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's
acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
being under any restraint beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own scanty rule of good-breeding.
I cannot imagine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will not be continually insulting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) visitor
with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will not be
continually detailing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) magnificent intentions, from the procuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
a permanent situation to the including her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in those delightful exploring
parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane Fairfax has feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley--<div class="bookquote">``I do not accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
of want of feeling. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;
but it wants openness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is reserved, more reserved, I think, than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to my
supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax
and conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), with admiration and pleasure always--but with no
thought beyond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVI


<p/>Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was
disposed to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) marriage. Dinner-parties and
evening-parties were made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) lady; and invitations flowed
in so fast that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were
never to have a disengaged day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see how it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I see what a life I am to lead among you.
Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite
the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very
formidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a
disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have
been at a loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>No invitation came amiss to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Bath habits made evening-parties
perfectly natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and Maple Grove had given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a taste for
dinners. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at
the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury
card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a
good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would soon shew
them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the spring
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) must return their civilities by one very superior party--in which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and
unbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the
evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the
refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.

<p/>Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at
Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful
resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for
ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the
usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,
with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).

<p/>The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the
Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of
course--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must
be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with
equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased
by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would rather not
be in his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) company more than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could help. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not yet quite
able to see him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) charming happy wife together, without feeling
uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would
rather stay at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) deemed it possible enough for wishing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was delighted with the
fortitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little friend--for fortitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to
give up being in company and stay at home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could now invite the
very person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--
Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had often
been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had said that Jane
Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``at least as far as relates to me, which
was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and
always knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)--I ought to have been more her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friend.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) will
never like me now. I have neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) too long. But I will shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
greater attention than I have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all
happy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet
over. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little
Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some
weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and
staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day
of this party.--His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) professional engagements did not allow of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) being
put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening
so. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the
utmost that his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma
apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not
being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without
falling in with a dinner-party.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could comfort herself, by
representing that though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) certainly would make them nine, yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very
immaterial. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to
have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother.

<p/>The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John
Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and
must be absent on the very day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might be able to join them in the
evening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;
and the seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) so, with the arrival of the little boys and the
philosophic composure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother on hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fate, removed the
chief of even Emma's vexation.

<p/>The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John
Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being
agreeable. Instead of drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother off to a window while they
waited for dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,
as elegant as lace and pearls could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked at in
silence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but
Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could talk
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) before breakfast as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was returning from a walk
with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It was
natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am
sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope you
turned directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I went only to the post-office,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and reached home before the
rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when
I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk
before breakfast does me good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards
from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry
and John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The
post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have
lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going
through the rain for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little blush, and then this answer,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every
dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing
older should make me indifferent about letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.
Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very
positive curse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of
friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have often thought them the worst of the two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) coolly.
<div class="bookquote">``Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I am
very sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I
can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than
to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which
makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every
body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again;
and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office,
I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than
to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``I meant to imply the change of situation which
time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will
generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily
circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old
friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence
you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant <div class="bookquote">``thank
you''  (<font color='red'><b>a lip</b></font>)</div>seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear
in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) attention was
now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) custom on such
occasions, making the circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) guests, and paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) particular
compliments to the ladies, was ending with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)--and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mildest
urbanity, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning
in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies
are delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their
complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind
solicitude about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I
hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very
old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You
do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I
are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest
satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had done his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.

<p/>By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
remonstrances now opened upon Jane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the
rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do
such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane very patiently assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had not caught any cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know
how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,
did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our
authority.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, <div class="bookquote">``I certainly do
feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable
as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly
careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think
requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even
half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough
again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too
reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>eagerly rejoined Mrs.
Elton. <div class="bookquote">``We will not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to do such a thing again:'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and nodding
significantly--<div class="bookquote">``there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.
I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning
-LRB-one of our men, I forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) name-RRB- shall inquire for yours too and
bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from
_us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept
such an accommodation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are extremely kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane; <div class="bookquote">``but I cannot give up my early
walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk
somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have
scarcely ever had a bad morning before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is
-LRB-laughing affectedly-RRB- as far as I can presume to determine any thing
without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,
you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter
myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I
meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as
settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot by any means consent to such
an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand
were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am
not here, by my grandmama's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to
employ our men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not mean to be conquered; but instead of
answering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The post-office is a wonderful establishment!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``The
regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,
and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly very well regulated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that
a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the
kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,
actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad
hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness
of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther
explanation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``they are paid for it. That is
the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual
observations made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard it asserted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``that the same sort
of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master
teaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine
the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very
little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can
get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not
always known their writing apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother hesitatingly, <div class="bookquote">``there is a likeness. I know what
you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse; <div class="bookquote">``and
always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--with half a sigh and half a
smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw any gentleman's handwriting'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--Emma began, looking also at
Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending
to some one else--and the pause gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) time to reflect, <div class="bookquote">``Now, how am
I going to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?--Am I unequal to speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name at once
before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout
phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that
would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce
his (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and
better.--Now for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Frank Churchill
writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not admire it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley. <div class="bookquote">``It is too small--wants
strength. It is like a woman's writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) against
the base aspersion. <div class="bookquote">``No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a
large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any
letter about her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to produce?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very lately,
but having answered the letter, had put it away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we were in the other room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``if I had my writing-desk, I
am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).--Do not you
remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to write for you one day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chose to say he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was employed'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince
Mr. Knightley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Knightley dryly, <div class="bookquote">``writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) will, of
course, put forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could be spoken to, was
ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) request to be
allowed to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) into the dining-parlour, was saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane's solicitude about fetching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own letters had not escaped Emma.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether
the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspected that it
_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full
expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been
in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a
glow both of complexion and spirits.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the
expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue's end--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
abstained. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt
Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the
room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the
beauty and grace of each.



<p/>CHAPTER XVII


<p/>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it
hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--with so
much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross
Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston were obliged to
be almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton
left them no choice. If Jane repressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for a little time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a
half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding
a knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catching
cold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion;
and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant
to Jane--inquiries whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had yet heard of any situation likely to
suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is April come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I get quite anxious about you. June
will soon be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked
forward to the summer in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But have you really heard of nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the
difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I not aware!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``dear Mrs. Elton, who can
have thought of it as I have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know
how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw
a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of
Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every
body was anxious to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bragge</b></font>) family, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bragge</b></font>) moves in the first circle.
Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all
houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see
you in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane. <div class="bookquote">``I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want
it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would
not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me
trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be
more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in
a day or two, and shall give her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>) a strict charge to be on the look-out
for any thing eligible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>); till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,
or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before
us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve,
and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence,
is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin
inquiring directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no
inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When
I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being
long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry
would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of human
flesh--but of human intellect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at
the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to
the abolition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>replied Jane;
<div class="bookquote">``governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely
different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to
the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But
I only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by
applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with
something that would do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something that would do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Elton. <div class="bookquote">``Aye, _that_ may suit
your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are;
but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any
thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family
not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;
it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I
think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.
A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall
be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite
on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the
first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name
your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family
as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, you
might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I
really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what
you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and
comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such
a situation together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``they are pretty sure to be equal;
however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted
at present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am
obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing
nothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I
shall remain where I am, and as I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am quite serious too, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Elton gaily,
<div class="bookquote">``in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to
watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>In this style she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.
Woodhouse came into the room; her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) vanity had then a change of object,
and Emma heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>)
gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature
he (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) is;--I assure you I like him (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) excessively. I admire all that quaint,
old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;
modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish
you had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I
began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I
am rather a favourite; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) took notice of my gown. How do you like
it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it
is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being
over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments
now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like
a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style
of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the
minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show
and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a
trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will
look well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.
Weston made his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) appearance among them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had returned to a late dinner,
and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been too much
expected by the best judges, for surprize--but there was great joy. Mr.
Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have been sorry
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That
a man who might have spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening quietly at home after a day
of business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile
to another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till
bed-time, of finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day in the efforts of civility and the noise
of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deeply. A man who had been
in motion since eight o’clock in the morning, and might now have been
still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had
been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to
quit the tranquillity and independence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fireside, and on the
evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by a touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger have instantly taken back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, there
would have been a motive; but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming would probably prolong rather
than break up the party. John Knightley looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) with amazement,
then shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) shoulders, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I could not have believed it
even of _him (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was
exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being
principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was
making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the
inquiries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dinner, convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that none of all
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread
abroad what public news he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had heard, was proceeding to a family
communication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in
the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
had met with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it, read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it will give you pleasure; only a few
lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The two ladies looked over it together; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sat smiling and talking
to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to
every body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say
to it?--I always told you he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne,
my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?--In
town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for _she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)_ is as
impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most
likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) illness, all
nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us
again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will be half his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.
Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read
it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some
other time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the
circumstance to the others in a common way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) looks
and words had nothing to restrain them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was
happy, and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to be happy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) congratulations were warm and
open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ was a little occupied
in weighing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
agitation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rather thought was considerable.

<p/>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative
to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did say,
and soon moved away to make the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friends happy by a partial
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.

<p/>It was well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) took every body's joy for granted, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might
not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly
delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to
be made happy;--from them he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have
been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.
Elton, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attention disengaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) necessarily began on the subject
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston.

<p/>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
by such a hope, smiled most graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
continued--<div class="bookquote">``and know him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to be my son, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) does not bear my name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) acquaintance. I am sure Mr.
Elton will lose no time in calling on him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); and we shall both have great
pleasure in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at the Vicarage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--
He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a
letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my
son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--it
was to Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) principal correspondent, I assure you. I
hardly ever get a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)! Oh! Mr.
Weston---LRB-laughing affectedly-RRB- I must protest against that.--A most
dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours
follow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we
married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, I could
not have believed it of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.
Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry,
merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up to
town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has not been well the
whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--so they are all to
move southward without loss of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a
considerable journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than
from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people
of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.
Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me--but twice
in one week he (<font color='blue'><b>Suckling</b></font>) and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four
horses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The evil of the distance from Enscombe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``is, that
Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the
sofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) complained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
said, of being too weak to get into her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conservatory without having
both his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arm and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree of
weakness--but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is so impatient to be in town, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) means to
sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word. Certainly,
delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You
must grant me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my
own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidable
antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women--and I assure you,
if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you
would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to
avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>)--and I believe I have
caught a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) nicety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) always travels with her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) own sheets;
an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine
lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land
for'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure
you. Do not run away with such an idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>)? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough
a fine lady as any body ever beheld.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Elton began to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.
It was by no means her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) object to have it believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sister was
_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of
it;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was considering in what way she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had best retract, when Mr.
Weston went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--but
this is quite between ourselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is very fond of Frank, and
therefore I would not speak ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is out of health
now; but _that_ indeed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has always been. I would
not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs.
Churchill's illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or to
Clifton?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has taken it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) head that Enscombe is too cold for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). The fact is, I suppose, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is tired of Enscombe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has now
been a longer time stationary there, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) ever was before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very
retired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from
the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You
seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--And
Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy
that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) may not have resources enough in
herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot
have too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many
myself as to be quite independent of society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frank was here in February for a fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I remember to have heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will find an _addition_ to the society
of Highbury when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) comes again; that is, if I may presume to call
myself an addition. But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) may never have heard of there being
such a creature in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.
Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.
Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full
of very little else than Mrs. Elton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) duty and could return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When Frank left us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it was quite uncertain when we
might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has
been completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn
up--but nobody believed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully
desponding. `How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) contrive to come? And how could it be supposed
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle and aunt would spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) again?' and so forth--I always
felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.
I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things
are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to
a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because
things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity
which suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) feelings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's saffron robe
would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those
gloomy ideas and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cheerfuller views! The carriage--we had
disappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came to
me quite in despair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly
seized the opportunity of going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill
is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than
Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable
prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the
season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at
the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and
never too hot for exercise. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was here before, we made the best
of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;
there always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we
intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I
do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the
sort of constant expectation there will be of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) coming in to-day or
to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than
having him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be
pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is generally
thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston's
partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is very great, and, as you may suppose, most
gratifying to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks nobody equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion
will be decidedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.
Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one
of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly
guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall
judge of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).--I am no flatterer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weston was musing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) presently, <div class="bookquote">``I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.
Churchill. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is ill I should be sorry to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) injustice; but
there are some traits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) character which make it difficult for me to
speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,
Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have
met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been
slighted as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was but for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Mr. Churchill has pride; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pride
is nothing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wife's: his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort
of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless
and tiresome; but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pride is arrogance and insolence! And what
inclines one less to bear, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has no fair pretence of family or blood.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was nobody when he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), barely the daughter of a gentleman;
but ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being turned into a Churchill she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has out-Churchill'd
them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is
an upstart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite
a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to
people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who
are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give
themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them
directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and
encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs,
and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.
A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West
Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from
Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston.
One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something
direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the
Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and
yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to
my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest
neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven
years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--I
believe, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed
the purchase before his (<font color='blue'><b>Suckling</b></font>) death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having
said all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.

<p/>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.
Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,
and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed
little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which
nobody had inclination to pay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was herself in a worry of spirits
which would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prefer being silent.

<p/>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was to
leave them early the next day; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon began with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the
boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full
length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to
recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather hope to satisfy you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``for I shall do all
in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and

mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought

which never took place. I can understand you---LRB-nodding at Mr. John

Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I
cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt
Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better
with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
is absent one--and who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) is at home, is either reading to himself
or settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) accounts.''

difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).




<p/>VOLUME III



<p/>CHAPTER I


<p/>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the
nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was soon convinced that it was not for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was feeling at all
apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own attachment had
really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--but
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the
two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had
taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two
months should not have cooled him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), there were dangers and evils before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>):--caution for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and for herself would be necessary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did
not mean to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own affections entangled again, and it would be
incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to avoid any encouragement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might be able to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) from an absolute declaration.
That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present
acquaintance! and yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not help rather anticipating something
decisive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a
crisis, an event, a something to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present composed and tranquil
state.

<p/>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's
feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been
imagined, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) rode down
for a couple of hours; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not yet do more; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came from
Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could then exercise all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quick
observation, and speedily determine how he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was influenced, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
must act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) great pleasure in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had an almost instant doubt
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) feeling the same tenderness
in the same degree. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) well. It was a clear thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was
less in love than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been. Absence, with the conviction probably
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable
effect.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed
delighted to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) former visit, and recur to old stories: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
was not without agitation. It was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) calmness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) comparative difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was not calm; his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits were evidently
fluttered; there was restlessness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Lively as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, it seemed
a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) belief
on the subject, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying
away to make other calls in Highbury. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) had seen a group of old
acquaintance in the street as he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) passed--he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) had not stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) would
not stop for more than a word--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) had the vanity to think they would
be disappointed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) did not call, and much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) wished to stay longer
at Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) must hurry off.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being less
in love--but neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) agitated spirits, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hurrying away, seemed
like a perfect cure; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was rather inclined to think it implied a
dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting
himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) long.

<p/>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
aunt could not bear to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own account at
Randall's. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were quite sincere, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) really tried to come, it was
to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no
service to the wilful or nervous part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) disorder. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was
really ill was very certain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had declared himself convinced of it, at
Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not doubt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked
back, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was in a weaker state of health than she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been half a
year ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care
and medicine might not remove, or at least that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might not have many
years of existence before her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not be prevailed on, by all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's doubts, to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) complaints were merely imaginary,
or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was as strong as ever.

<p/>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could
not endure its noise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nerves were under continual irritation and
suffering; and by the ten days' end, her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew's letter to Randalls
communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to
Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of
an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A
ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit
expected from the change.

<p/>Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the
house was taken for May and June. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was told that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) wrote with
the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
could even wish.

<p/>Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was
considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as the source of all the happiness they offered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.

<p/>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was quite delighted.
It was the very circumstance he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could have wished for. Now, it would be
really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to
a young man?--An hour's ride. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be always coming over. The
difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make
the whole difference of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never. Sixteen
miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was
a serious obstacle. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever able to get away, the day would be
spent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in
London; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very
distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!

<p/>One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this
removal,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,
but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,
however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and
very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from
Frank, to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) aunt felt already much better for the change, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at
any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.

<p/>Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood
between the young people of Highbury and happiness.

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).
May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to
spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sanguinely
hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any
thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.



<p/>CHAPTER II


<p/>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,
the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank
Churchill, in all the certainty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own self, reached Randalls before
dinner, and every thing was safe.

<p/>No second meeting had there yet been between him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and Emma. The room
at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a
common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
entreaties for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,
for the purpose of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion as to the propriety and comfort of
the rooms before any other persons came, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>),
and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the
Randalls party just sufficiently before them.

<p/>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not
say much, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) eyes declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) meant to have a delightful evening.
They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should
be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another
carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great
surprize. <div class="bookquote">``So unreasonably early!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was going to exclaim; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,
like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and
they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,
who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing
earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company
might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory
inspection.

<p/>Emma perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston
depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man
who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first
distinction in the scale of vanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) open manners, but
a little less of open-heartedness would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a higher
character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a
man what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could fancy such a man. The whole party
walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing
else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe
in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though
_May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.

<p/>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy
councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door
to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be
brought by the Eltons.

<p/>Frank was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), but not steadily; there was a restlessness,
which shewed a mind not at ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was looking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was going to
the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient
to begin, or afraid of being always near her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Elton was spoken of. <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be here soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
It cannot be long, I think, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A carriage was heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was on the move immediately; but coming back,
said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). I have never seen
either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties
passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston, looking about. <div class="bookquote">``We
thought you were to bring them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma
longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was affected by the studied elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) dress, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) smiles of
graciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,
by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.

<p/>In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--<div class="bookquote">``I
will see that there are umbrellas, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father:
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Bates must not be forgotten:''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>and away he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) went. Mr. Weston was
following; but Mrs. Elton detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) opinion
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; and so briskly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) begin, that the young man himself,
though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you
I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely
pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
a very handsome young man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) manners are precisely what I like and
approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.
You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.
They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor
me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very
cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them
much better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) got to Maple Grove, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) could recollect that there were ladies
just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.

<p/>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of its being our
carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so
extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--What
a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--I understand you
were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.
You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into
the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) duty as Mrs.
Weston's to receive them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gestures and movements might be understood
by any one who looked on like Emma; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) words, every body's words,
were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in
talking, and had not finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speech under many minutes after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was
heard,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not
care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!---LRB-as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was within the door-RRB- Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is
admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could
not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you
ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's
lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) own room again. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) as
I came in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) was standing in the entrance. `Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said
I--but I had not time for more.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was now met by Mrs. Weston.--<div class="bookquote">``Very
well, I thank you, ma’am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear
it. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often,
and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.
Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent
time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most
comfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,
Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,
or we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were
such neighbours. I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma’am--.' Thank
you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) large new shawl--
Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to think of my mother!
Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three
others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel
Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did
not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but
Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step
upon--I shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank
Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in
fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of
your good-nature. Does not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank
Churchill?--Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do
you do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite
in fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know
-LRB-eyeing Emma most complacently-RRB---that would be rude--but upon my word,
Miss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are
a judge.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
hair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I
declare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a
moment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This
is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is.
Don't disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How
do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through
the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway
and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr.
Arthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much
obliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can
this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming
to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am
quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A
little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.
Every thing so good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Frank Churchill returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) station by Emma; and as soon as Miss
Bates was quiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse
of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was thoughtful. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were overhearing too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could not
determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dress and look,
compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently
wanting to be complimented herself--and it was, <div class="bookquote">``How do you like
my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done my
hair?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient
politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, <div class="bookquote">``Nobody can think less of dress in
general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's
eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have
no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish
to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except
mine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall
see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.
I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not
but imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had overheard his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own praises, and did not want to hear
more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till
another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly
forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife was exclaiming,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I was
this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for
tidings of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane!'' (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and
displeasure.--<div class="bookquote">``That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I
suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you like Mrs. Elton?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are ungrateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ungrateful!--What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then changing from a frown to a
smile--<div class="bookquote">``No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where
is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could hardly understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed in an odd humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) walked
off to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and
Mrs. Weston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be
laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton
must be asked to begin the ball; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would expect it; which
interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma
heard the sad truth with fortitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are we to do for a proper partner for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will think Frank ought to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) former promise; and
boasted himself an engaged man, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) most perfect
approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)_
to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs.
Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had always
considered the ball as peculiarly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). It was almost enough to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this
time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had intended to
begin with Frank Churchill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston
might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son's superior.--In spite of this little rub, however,
Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length
of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had so many hours
of unusual festivity before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more disturbed by Mr.
Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was, among
the standers-by, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought not to be; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought to be dancing,--not
classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who
were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were
made up,--so young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked!--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not have appeared to greater
advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had placed himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) tall,
firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of
the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;
and, excepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own partner, there was not one among the whole row of
young men who could be compared with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) moved a few steps nearer,
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,
with what natural grace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must have danced, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) but take the
trouble.--Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to smile; but
in general he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was looking grave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could love a ballroom
better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed often
observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not flatter herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
dancing, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were criticising her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) behaviour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not feel
afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner.
They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank
Churchill thought less of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done, was indubitable.

<p/>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant
attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed
happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom
bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in
the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very
recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually
are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two
last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the
only young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the
number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the
wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton
sauntering about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible
to be avoided: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
every moment to escape into the card-room.

<p/>Escape, however, was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came to the part of the room where
the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front
of them, as if to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) liberty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) resolution of maintaining
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or
speaking to those who were close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).--Emma saw it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not yet
dancing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was working her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way up from the bottom, and had therefore
leisure to look around, and by only turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head a little she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw
it all. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would no longer allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes to watch; but Mr.
Elton was so near, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard every syllable of a dialogue which
just then took place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) perceived that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife, who was standing immediately above her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), was not only
listening also, but even encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) by significant glances.--The
kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seat to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and say,
<div class="bookquote">``Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prompt reply was, <div class="bookquote">``Most
readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no
dancer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall have great
pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old
married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very
great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.
Gilbert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady
disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss
Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I
were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.
You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your
command--but my dancing days are over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and
mortification she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seat. This was Mr. Elton! the
amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked round for a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself
for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not look again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart was in a glow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feared her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
face might be as hot.

<p/>In another moment a happier sight caught her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>);--Mr. Knightley leading
Harriet to the set!--Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) been more surprized, seldom more
delighted, than at that instant. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was all pleasure and gratitude,
both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and though
too distant for speech, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) countenance said much, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could
catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye again.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) dancing proved to be just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed it, extremely good;
and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for
the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment
and very high sense of the distinction which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happy features
announced. It was not thrown away on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) bounded higher than ever,
flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.

<p/>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking -LRB-Emma trusted-RRB- very
foolish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was quite so hardened as his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife, though
growing very like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>);--_she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ spoke some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings, by observing
audibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very good-natured,
I declare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div><p/>Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from
that moment, without interruption, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) being seated at table and
taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) spoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.
Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is afraid there will
be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door
nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.
Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so
gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I
said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and
nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.
Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a
vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits
and baked apples and wine before she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came away: amazing luck in some
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) throws: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) inquired a great deal about you, how you were
amused, and who were your partners. `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall
Jane; I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dancing with Mr. George Otway; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will love to tell
you all about it herself to-morrow: her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) first partner was Mr. Elton,
I do not know who will ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear
sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am
not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and
me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is
going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we
all follow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we
are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,
there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!
I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any
thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling
you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The
baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there
was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at
first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled
enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves
better than sweetbread and asparagus--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was rather disappointed,
but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of
its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much
concerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have
supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing
like it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,
so that Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.
Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--only
it seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house
cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes
for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but
it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;
but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes invited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) irresistibly to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and be thanked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;
and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Emma, why is it
that they are your enemies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,
<div class="bookquote">``_She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) may
be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,
that you did want him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) to marry Harriet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>penetration</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, <div class="bookquote">``and they cannot forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
only said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell
me I am wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong,
I am sure the other tells you of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is
a littleness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) which you discovered, and which I did not: and I
was fully convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) being in love with Harriet. It was through a
series of strange blunders!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the
justice to say, that you would have chosen for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has
chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which
Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless
girl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a
woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of
Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all
doing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!
Every body is asleep!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``whenever I am wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom are you going to dance with?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Knightley.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hesitated a moment, and then replied, <div class="bookquote">``With you, if you will ask
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are
not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother and sister! no, indeed.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER III


<p/>This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable
pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was extremely
glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the
Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much
alike; and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) praise of Harriet, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) concession in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) favour, was
peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few
minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evening, had been the
occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked forward
to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--From
Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the
ballroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had strong hopes. It seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eyes were suddenly
opened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior
creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). The fever was over, and Emma could
harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious
courtesy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for
supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther
requisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and
Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), how very happy a summer
must be before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was
to be at home by the middle of the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not regret it.

<p/>Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all
to rights, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up
for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,
when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet
leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white
and frightened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was trying to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--The iron gates and the
front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon in
the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.

<p/>A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,
and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the
suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted
with the whole.

<p/>Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.
Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and
taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough
for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury,
making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became
for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies
had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small
distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a
party of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and
Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling
on Harriet to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at
the top, and made the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way by a short cut back to Highbury.
But poor Harriet could not follow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had suffered very much from cramp
after dancing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first attempt to mount the bank brought on such
a return of it as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absolutely powerless--and in this state, and
exceedingly terrified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been obliged to remain.

<p/>How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more
courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could
not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children,
headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent
in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
immediately promised them money, and taking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) purse, gave them a
shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ill.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
terror and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) purse were too tempting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was followed, or rather
surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.

<p/>In this state Frank Churchill had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) trembling and
conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) assistance
at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to walk forward, and leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) horses to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) by another road,
a mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair
of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to
restore them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been obliged to stop at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) door, and go in for a
few minutes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was therefore later than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had intended; and being
on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The
terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then
their own portion. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had left them completely frightened; and Harriet
eagerly clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and hardly able to speak, had just strength
enough to reach Hartfield, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) spirits were quite overcome.
It was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) idea to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) to Hartfield: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had thought of no other
place.

<p/>This was the amount of the whole story,--of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) communication and of
Harriet's as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) senses and speech.--He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dared
not stay longer than to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) well; these several delays left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people
in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) set off, with all the grateful
blessings that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could utter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend and herself.

<p/>Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman
thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain
ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at
least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician
have seen what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, have witnessed their appearance together, and
heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been
at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much
more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and
foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
mind had already made.

<p/>It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever
occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory; no
rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very
person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing
to pass by to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And
knowing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, the favourable state of mind of each at this
period, it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the more. He (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) was wishing to get the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>)
attachment to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) just recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mania for Mr. Elton.
It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting
consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not be
strongly recommending each to the other.

<p/>In the few minutes' conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had yet had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), while
Harriet had been partially insensible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) terror,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) naivete, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fervour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seized and clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) arm, with a
sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's
own account had been given, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) indignation at the
abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was
to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) had had enough of
interference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.
It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) would on no account proceed.

<p/>Emma's first resolution was to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father from the knowledge of
what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour
it was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those
who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in
the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night's
ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) sat,
and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their
promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
neighbours knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) loved to be inquired after-RRB-, as well as Miss
Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had
the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very
indifferent--which, though not exactly true, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was perfectly well,
and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not invent
illnesses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could make no figure in a message.

<p/>The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took
themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have
walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history
dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
nephews:--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and
John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the
gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) right if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) varied in the
slightest particular from the original recital.



<p/>CHAPTER IV


<p/>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one
morning to Emma with a small parcel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, and after sitting down
and hesitating, thus began:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I should
like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, it
will be over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to speak. There was a
seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), quite as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
words, for something more than ordinary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``to have
no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered
creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have
the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is
necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and
I dare say you understand me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I hope I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet,
warmly. <div class="bookquote">``It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary
in him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) now.--I do not care whether I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) or not--except that of the
two I had rather not see him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)--and indeed I would go any distance round
to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)--but I do not envy his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) wife in the least; I neither admire
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nor envy her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as I have done: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is very charming, I dare say, and
all that, but I think her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall
never forget her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss
Woodhouse, I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,
it will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I
have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to
have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--I know that
very well -LRB-blushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) spoke-RRB-.--However, now I will destroy it
all--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you
may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel
holds?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), with a conscious look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least in the world.--Did he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ever give you any thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued
very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) held the parcel towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and Emma read the words _Most_
_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) curiosity was greatly excited.
Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked on with impatience. Within
abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,
which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,
excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``you _must_ recollect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed I do not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what
passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last
times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my
sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think the
very evening.--Do not you remember his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) finger with your new
penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had none
about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); and so I took
mine out and cut him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making
a treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now
and then as a great treat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Harriet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) face,
and jumping up, <div class="bookquote">``you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.
Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this
relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting the
finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none
about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my
pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual
blush all the rest of my life.--Well---LRB-sitting down again-RRB---go on--what
else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected
it, you did it so naturally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) state of shame and feeling divided
between wonder and amusement. And secretly she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Lord
bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a
piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I
never was equal to this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>resumed Harriet, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) box again, <div class="bookquote">``here is something
still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because
this is what did really once belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), which the court-plaister
never did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an
old pencil,--the part without any lead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet.--<div class="bookquote">``Do not you remember one
morning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactly
the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_
_evening_, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wanted to make a memorandum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pocket-book; it was
about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) something about
brewing spruce-beer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to put it down; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) pencil, there was so little lead that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon cut it all away, and
it would not do, so you lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) another, and this was left upon the
table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I
dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do remember it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma; <div class="bookquote">``I perfectly remember it.--Talking
about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we
liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I
perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was
not he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)? I have an idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was standing just here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot
recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I
am now.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that
I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see
me do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in
treasuring up these things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I
could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you
know, to keep any remembrances, after he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was married. I knew it was--but
had not resolution enough to part with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not
a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be
useful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be happier to burn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``It has a disagreeable
look to me. I must get rid of every thing.--There it goes, and there is
an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>thought Emma, <div class="bookquote">``will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already
made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had _told_ no
fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight
after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite
undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the
information she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) received more valuable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) merely said, in the course
of some trivial chat, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise
you to do so and so'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's
silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, <div class="bookquote">``I shall never
marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a
moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never marry!--This is a new resolution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is one that I shall never change, however.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After another short hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``I hope it does not proceed from--I hope
it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet indignantly.--<div class="bookquote">``Oh! no'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--and Emma could
just catch the words, <div class="bookquote">``so superior to Mr. Elton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) then took a longer time for consideration. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) proceed no
farther?--should she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps
Harriet might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cold or angry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did; or perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were
totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to hear too
much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such
an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was perfectly
resolved.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed it would be wiser for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to say and know at
once, all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always
best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had previously determined how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would proceed, on any
application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the
judicious law of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own brain laid down with speed.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was decided,
and thus spoke--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your
resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from
an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your
superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--
Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at a
distance--and to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) infinite superiority to all the rest of
the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so
proper, in me especially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) rendered you
was enough to warm your heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The very
recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
coming--his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In
one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes,
honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that
it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not
advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage
for its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be
wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not
let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) liking you. Be
observant of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Let his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I
give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on
the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I
know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very
wrong before; we will be cautious now.--He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is your superior, no doubt,
and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but
yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been
matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not
have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your
raising your thoughts to _him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)_, is a mark of good taste which I shall
always know how to value.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was
very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend.
Its tendency would be to raise and refine her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind--and it must be
saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the danger of degradation.



<p/>CHAPTER V


<p/>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon
Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The
Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use
to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again
delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was likely
to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) were able
to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) service, and save herself from
being hurried into a delightful situation against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) will.

<p/>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly
taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) began to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) of some double dealing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pursuit
of Emma. That Emma was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) object appeared indisputable. Every thing
declared it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's hints, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mother-in-law's
guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and
indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
to Emma, and Emma herself making him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley
began to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between
them--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) side, which,
having once observed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not persuade himself to think entirely
void of meaning, however he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might wish to escape any of Emma's errors
of imagination. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from
the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) was
again in their company, he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) could not help remembering what he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) had seen;
nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and
his (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) fire at twilight,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Myself creating what I saw,''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>brought him (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private
liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had walked up one day after dinner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very often did, to spend
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) joined
them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like
themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the
weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on
reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of
visiting that would be welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, pressed them all to go in
and drink tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and
after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened
to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most
obliging invitation.

<p/>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.
The gentlemen spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, <div class="bookquote">``what
became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) ever had
any such plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what
was certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was
extremely happy about it. It was owing to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>)_ persuasion, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>)
thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) being out in bad weather did him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) a great deal of harm. You
must remember it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must have
dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as if
you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?--What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``about Perry and a
carriage? Is Perry going to set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage, Frank? I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) can
afford it. You had it from himself, had you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``I seem to have had it from
nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having
mentioned it in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all
these particulars--but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never heard a syllable of
it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.
I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone
through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.
Perry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is odd though,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``that you should have had such
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you
should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage! and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) wife's persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to it, out of care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) health--just
what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little
premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!
And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream
certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.
Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was out of hearing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had hurried on before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) guests to
prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr.
Weston's hint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to own the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain
to be heard the last two minutes, <div class="bookquote">``if I must speak on this subject,
there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean
to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest
dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge
that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself
mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as
ourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only
thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) should
have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember
grandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we
had been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to
Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed
I do not know who is not--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had mentioned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) in confidence;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had no objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) telling us, of course, but it was not to go
beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that
I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having
never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before
I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and
then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like
Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ never betrayed the least
thing in the world. Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember
Mrs. Perry's coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss
Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had
involuntarily turned to hers; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was indeed behind, and too busy
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited
at the door to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank
Churchill the determination of catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eye--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
intently--in vain, however, if it were so--Jane passed between them
into the hall, and looked at neither.

<p/>There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be
borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seat with the rest round the
large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and
which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly,
and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could reach as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat, <div class="bookquote">``have your nephews taken away their
alphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?
This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather
as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one
morning. I want to puzzle you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table
was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much
disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words
for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness
of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had
often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had
occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,
with tender melancholy, over the departure of the <div class="bookquote">``poor little boys,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>or in fondly pointing out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) took up any stray letter near him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), how
beautifully Emma had written it.

<p/>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a slight
glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to
Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them
all; and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) object to see as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could, with as little
apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile
pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and
buried from sight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should have looked on the table instead of
looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after
every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to
work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) for help. The
word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a
blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.
Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,
was beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
favourite could have been so lain asleep! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feared there must be some
decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and
trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank
Churchill's part.

<p/>With great indignation did he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) continue to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); with great alarm
and distrust, to observe also his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) two blinded companions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw a short
word prepared for Emma, and given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a look sly and demure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,
though it was something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judged it proper to appear to censure;
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! for shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heard Frank Churchill next say,
with a glance towards Jane, <div class="bookquote">``I will give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)--shall I?'' (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>--and as
clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. <div class="bookquote">``No, no, you
must not; you shall not, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without
feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed
over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate
civility entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity
to know what this word might be, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seize every possible moment
for darting his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye towards it, and it was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw it
to be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>);
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning,
the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was
evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed
more deeply than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had ever perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), and saying only, <div class="bookquote">``I did not
know that proper names were allowed,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>pushed away the letters with even
an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word
that could be offered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) face was averted from those who had made the
attack, and turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, very true, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken
a word--<div class="bookquote">``I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be
going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking
for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good
night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) as ready as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt had
preconceived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but
so many were also moving, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not get away; and Mr. Knightley
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and resolutely swept away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unexamined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was afterwards
looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing
dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley
could not tell.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thoughts full of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
observations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must--yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) certainly must, as a friend--an anxious
friend--give Emma some hint, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) some question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the
poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the
word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the
one, and so very distressing to the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was extremely confused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not endure to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) the true
explanation; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspicions were by no means removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
really ashamed of having ever imparted them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried in evident embarrassment, <div class="bookquote">``it all meant nothing; a mere
joke among ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied gravely, <div class="bookquote">``seemed confined to you and Mr.
Churchill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would speak again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would rather
busy herself about any thing than speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sat a little while in
doubt. A variety of evils crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind. Interference--fruitless
interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to
declare her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection engaged. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) owed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference,
rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the
remembrance of neglect in such a cause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at last, with earnest kindness, <div class="bookquote">``do you
think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the
gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.--Why
do you make a doubt of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you never at any time had reason to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), or
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried with a most open eagerness--<div class="bookquote">``Never, for the
twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could
it possibly come into your head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between
them--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be
public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can
vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorry
to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do. There is no
admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which
have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelings
rather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly to
explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it--but the part which is
capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far
from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in
the world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) side, and I
can _answer_ for its being so on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). I will answer for the gentleman's
indifference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction
which silenced, Mr. Knightley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was in gay spirits, and would have
prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a
circumstance which highly entertained her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>): but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) gaiety did not meet
hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not be useful, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feelings were too much
irritated for talking. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might not be irritated into an absolute
fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost
every evening throughout the year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) soon afterwards took a hasty
leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.



<p/>CHAPTER VI


<p/>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.
Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such
importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at
present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted
to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had
been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health
seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs.
Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much
increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) neighbours was
by the approach of it.

<p/>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal
of pleasure and parade. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) introductions and recommendations must all
wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) thought
at first;--but a little consideration convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) that every thing
need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though
the Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the
autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was
to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the
idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished to see what
every body found so well worth seeing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Weston had agreed
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the
chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a
quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and
preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the
Eltons and the Sucklings.

<p/>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but
feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) brother and sister had
failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that
as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
had no objection. Now, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) objection was nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) very great
dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly
aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done
without a reproof to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), which would be giving pain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would
probably expose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs.
Elton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you approve of what I have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very comfortably.
<div class="bookquote">``But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without
numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its
own amusement. And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a good-natured woman after all. One could not
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.

<p/>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton
was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to
pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing
into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,
before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured
on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were
inadequate to such an attack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) cried.--<div class="bookquote">``And such weather
for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What
are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing
done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful
exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better explore to Donwell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Knightley. <div class="bookquote">``That may
be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening
fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was obliged to proceed so,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) proposal was caught at with delight; and the <div class="bookquote">``Oh! I should like
it of all things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was
famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:
but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt
the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) again
and again to come--much oftener than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) doubted--and was extremely
gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment
as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chose to consider it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may depend upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I certainly will come. Name your
day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot name a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``till I have spoken to some others whom
I would wish to meet you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am Lady
Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will bring Elton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``but I will not trouble you to
give any other invitations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid
of delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) preferment.
Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave
it all to me. I will invite your guests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) calmly replied,--<div class="bookquote">``there is but one married woman in the world
whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleases to Donwell, and
that one is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is in being, I will manage such
matters myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are an odd creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) cried, satisfied to have no one
preferred to herself.--<div class="bookquote">``You are a humourist, and may say what you
like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
aunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting
the Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss
Bates in my way home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. It
is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I
shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging
on my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be
more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be
no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about
your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under
trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out
of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural
and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have
the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of
gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is
best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating
strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye,
can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be
sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect
anything--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely
clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and
would spurn any body's assistance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on
donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. I
really must talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) about purchasing a donkey. In a country life
I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever
so many resources, it is not possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be always shut up at
home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in
winter there is dirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is
never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if
you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to
be as much to your taste as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.
Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the
warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--Yes,
believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in
the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to
eat would inevitably make him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the
specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at
Donwell, be tempted away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) misery.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) easy credulity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not been at Donwell for two
years. <div class="bookquote">``Some very fine morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), and Emma, and Harriet, could go
very well; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls
walked about the gardens. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not suppose they could be damp now,
in the middle of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should like to see the old house again
exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and
any other of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) neighbours.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not see any objection at all to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind
and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not fond of dining
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The
invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like
Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment
to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of
pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to
join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could
have been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in
writing, and spare no arguments to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to come.

<p/>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to
Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was
settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing
exactly right.

<p/>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was
safely conveyed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) carriage, with one window down, to partake of
this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the
Abbey, especially prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) by a fire all the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was
happily placed, quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what
had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not
to heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on
purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), remained, when
all the others were invited or persuaded out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) patient listener and
sympathiser.

<p/>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
satisfied of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's comfort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was glad to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and look
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); eager to refresh and correct her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory with more particular
observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must
ever be so interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt all the honest pride and complacency which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) alliance with
the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) viewed
the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,
characteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens
stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with
all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance
of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance
had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike
it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many
comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought
to be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect
for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted
in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had;
but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had given them
neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were
pleasant feelings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) walked about and indulged them till it
was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the
strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank
Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,
in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) apparatus of happiness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) large bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) basket,
was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or
talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or
spoken of.--<div class="bookquote">``The best fruit in England--every body's favourite--always
wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to
gather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning
decidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboy
infinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--hautboys
very scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all--price
of strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--Maple
Grove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly
different--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of their
way--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior
to cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering
strawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no
longer--must go and sit in the shade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by
Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) solicitude after her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son-in-law, to
inquire if he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) were come--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was a little uneasy.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had some
fears of his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) horse.

<p/>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged
to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A
situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had
received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not
with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and
splendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.
Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.
Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,
every thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with
immediately.--On her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
positively refused to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax
continued to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not at present engage in any
thing, repeating the same motives which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been heard to urge
before.--Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an
acquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was
astonishing to Emma.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did look vexed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did speak pointedly--and
at last, with a decision of action unusual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), proposed a
removal.--<div class="bookquote">``Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the
gardens--all the gardens?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wished to see the whole extent.'' (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>--The
pertinacity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend seemed more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could bear.

<p/>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,
dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one
another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which
stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed
the finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but a
view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed
intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to
the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be
the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and
the view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at
nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper
form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of
considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at
the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the
Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and
handsome curve around it.

<p/>It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,
English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being
oppressive.

<p/>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and
towards this view she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet
distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and
Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was glad to see it.--There
had been a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have scorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as a companion, and
turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant
conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry
to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of
prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in
blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) joined them at the
wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma
received a smile which seemed to say, <div class="bookquote">``These are my own concerns. I have
a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of
introducing Robert Martin.'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). It was too old
a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They
took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was most
refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.

<p/>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and they
were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.
Weston looked, and looked in vain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father would not own himself
uneasy, and laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fears; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be cured of wishing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would part with his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) black mare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had expressed himself as to
coming, with more than common certainty. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) aunt was so much better,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not a doubt of getting over to them.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Churchill</b></font>)</div>--Mrs. Churchill's
state, however, as many were ready to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), was liable to such
sudden variation as might disappoint her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew in the most reasonable
dependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,
that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was
prevented coming.--Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under
consideration; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.

<p/>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see
what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far
as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at
any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.
Woodhouse, who had already taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) little round in the highest part
of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>),
stirred no more; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter resolved to remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), that
Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband to the exercise and
variety which her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) spirits seemed to need.

<p/>Mr. Knightley had done all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) power for Mr. Woodhouse's
entertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,
shells, and every other family collection within his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cabinets, had been
prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness
had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.
Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would shew them
all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than
in a total want of taste for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) saw, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was slow, constant, and
methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma
walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of
the entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when
Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a
look of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there
was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was in
quest of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be so kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when I am missed, as to say that I am
gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it
is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted,
and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any
body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to the
ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be
missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am
gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury
alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty
minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my
father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can be
round in five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And
for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to
guard others!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, <div class="bookquote">``That
can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the
carriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered--<div class="bookquote">``I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of
fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know
at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are
exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have
my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma had not another word to oppose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw it all; and entering into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings, promoted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitting the house immediately, and
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) parting look was
grateful--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) parting words, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of
being sometimes alone!'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and
to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
even towards some of those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) best.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned back into
the hall again. <div class="bookquote">``I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of
their just horrors, the more I shall like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only
accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank
Churchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
forgotten to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Mrs. Weston
would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right
who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been detained by
a temporary increase of illness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); a nervous seizure, which had
lasted some hours--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had quite given up every thought of coming,
till very late;--and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) known how hot a ride he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should have, and
how late, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hurry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should not have
come at all. The heat was excessive; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never suffered any thing
like it--almost wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had staid at home--nothing killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
like heat--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was
intolerable--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the
slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be
spared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be
going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I
came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of
humour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) constitution; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew that eating and drinking were often
the cure of such incidental complaints, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recommended his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) taking
some refreshment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would find abundance of every thing in the
dining-room--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) humanely pointed out the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should not eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was not hungry; it would only make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
hotter.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In two minutes, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) relented in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own favour; and
muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, saying in secret--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad I have done being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I should not like a man
who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper
will not mind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came
back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like
himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their
employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should be so late.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,
at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking
over views in Swisserland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall
never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my
sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my
poem. I shall do something to expose myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to
Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I
assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I
shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I
want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating
eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if
I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few
hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do
not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted
in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate
person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and
eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of
cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on
a par with the rest of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is not
Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of
a change. You will stay, and go with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then pray stay at Richmond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you
all there without me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your
own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.
With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others
took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and
disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. That it was
time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final
arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill's
little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) last
words to Emma were,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond
was to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) back before the following evening.



<p/>CHAPTER VII


<p/>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward
circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in
favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating
safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good
time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) niece, with
the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.
Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.
Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body
had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount
of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,
a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much
into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of
Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.
And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed
at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and
Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable
as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the
hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties,
too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any
cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.

<p/>At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never seen Frank
Churchill so silent and stupid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) said nothing worth hearing--looked
without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet
should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.

<p/>When they all sat down it was better; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) taste a great deal better,
for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first object.
Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
To amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and be agreeable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eyes, seemed all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) cared
for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay
and easy too, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) all the friendly encouragement, the admission
to be gallant, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever given in the first and most animating
period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own estimation,
meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must
have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very
well describe. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together
excessively.''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and
to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to
Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any
real felicity; it was rather because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt less happy than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laughed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was disappointed; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,
admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still intended him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much I am obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for telling me to come
to-day!--If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all
the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you
were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you
deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hotter to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are comfortable because you are under command.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your command?--Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,
somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own
management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot be always
with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command
rather than mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a
motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always
with me. You are always with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not
begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you
first in February.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But -LRB-lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) voice-RRB---nobody
speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking
nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing of which I am ashamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), with lively
impudence. <div class="bookquote">``I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill
hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,
and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then
whispering--<div class="bookquote">``Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do
to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies
and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse -LRB-who, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is,
presides-RRB- to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) desires to know what you are all thinking
of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great
deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.
Knightley's answer was the most distinct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would like to hear what we are all
thinking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, no'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could--<div class="bookquote">``Upon no
account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt
of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking
of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, -LRB-glancing
at Mr. Weston and Harriet,-RRB- whose thoughts I might not be afraid of
knowing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a sort of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``which _I_
should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,
perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--_I_ never was in any
circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mutterings were chiefly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) husband; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) murmured, in reply,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard
of--but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every
body knows what is due to _you_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>whispered Frank to Emma; <div class="bookquote">``they are most of them
affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen--I
am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) waives her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) right of
knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires
something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here
are seven of you, besides myself, -LRB-who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is pleased to say, am very
entertaining already,-RRB- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) only demands from each of you either one
thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or two
things moderately clever--or three things very dull indeed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
engages to laugh heartily at them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Bates, <div class="bookquote">``then I need not be uneasy.
`Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. I
shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,
shan't I? -LRB-looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every
body's assent-RRB---Do not you all think I shall?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not resist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will be
limited as to number--only three at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) manner, did not
immediately catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) meaning; but, when it burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), it could not
anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) means, -LRB-turning to Mr.
Knightley,-RRB- and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very
disagreeable, or she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would not have said such a thing to an old friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston. <div class="bookquote">``Agreed, agreed. I will do my
best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son;--<div class="bookquote">``but we shall be
indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.
Weston's shall clear him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me
hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt its being very clever myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston. <div class="bookquote">``It is too much
a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are
there, that express perfection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you will never guess. You, -LRB-to Emma-RRB-, I am certain, will never
guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very
indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and
enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touch
the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.
Knightley gravely said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston
has done very well for himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must have knocked up every body
else. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Elton; ``_I_
really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had
an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all
pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You know
who I mean -LRB-nodding to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) husband-RRB-. These kind of things are very
well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of
place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.
Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty
things at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a
great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to
judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please,
Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing
clever to say--not one of us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) husband, with a sort of sneering
consciousness; <div class="bookquote">``_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss
Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man--quite good for
nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.
Come, Jane, take my other arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.
<div class="bookquote">``Happy couple!''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of
hearing:--<div class="bookquote">``How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as they
did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew
each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as to
any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public
place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is
only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as
they always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it
is all guess and luck--and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man
has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest
of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own
confederates, spoke now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such things do occur, undoubtedly.'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was stopped by a cough. Frank
Churchill turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were speaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), gravely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances
do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be
very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--but there is
generally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to
mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, -LRB-whose happiness
must be always at the mercy of chance,-RRB- who will suffer an unfortunate
acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon
afterwards said, in a lively tone,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I
marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? -LRB-turning to
Emma.-RRB- Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body
fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, -LRB-with a smile at
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) father-RRB-. Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), educate
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means, if you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.
I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall come
to you for my wife. Remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every
favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?
Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wished.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might even have Harriet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thoughts at the moment; who could say?
Referring the education to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seemed to imply it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt, <div class="bookquote">``shall we join Mrs. Elton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was
ready to have gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), but this will do just as well. We shall
soon overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). There she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is--no, that's somebody else. That's one
of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).--Well, I
declare--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits
now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of
flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about
with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended
to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The
appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the
carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and
preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)_
carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive
home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of
pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped never to be betrayed into again.

<p/>While waiting for the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) found Mr. Knightley by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a
privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.
I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be
so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to
a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thought
it possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.
It was not so very bad. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not understand me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt your full meaning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has talked of
it since. I wish you could have heard how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talked of it--with what
candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) honouring your
forbearance, in being able to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) such attentions, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was for
ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) society must be
so irksome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I know there is not a better creature in the world:

unfortunately blended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are blended,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I acknowledge; and, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prosperous,
I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over
the good. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless
absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any
liberties of manner. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) your equal in situation--but, Emma,
consider how far this is from being the case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is poor; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has sunk
from the comforts she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was born to; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) live to old age, must
probably sink more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation should secure your compassion. It was
badly done, indeed! You, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had known from an infant, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
seen grow up from a period when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) notice was an honour, to have you
now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
humble her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--and before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) niece, too--and before others, many of whom
-LRB-certainly _some_,-RRB- would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--This is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from
pleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and
trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you
can do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was
ready; and, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could speak again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had
misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face averted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,
mortification, and deep concern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not been able to speak; and, on
entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--then reproaching
herself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in
apparent sullenness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a
difference; but it was just too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had turned away, and the horses
were in motion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with
what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and
every thing left far behind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was vexed beyond what could have been
expressed--almost beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could conceal. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt so
agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
most forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no
denying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) have been so brutal,
so cruel to Miss Bates! How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) have exposed herself to such ill
opinion in any one she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) valued! And how suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) without
saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!

<p/>Time did not compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) reflected more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) seemed but to feel
it more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary
to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,
fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to
check them, extraordinary as they were.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII


<p/>The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the
evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could
not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,
might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) view it was
a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational
satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than
any she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father,
was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comfort; and
feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fond affection and
confiding esteem, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) general conduct, be open to any
severe reproach. As a daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not without a heart.
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hoped no one could have said to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``How could you be so unfeeling
to your father?--I must, I will tell you truths while I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Miss
Bates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do
away the past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) might hope to be forgiven. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had been often remiss,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) conscience told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;
scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true
contrition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) the very next morning, and it should
be the beginning, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that
nothing might prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). It was not unlikely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) thought, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
might see Mr. Knightley in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) way; or, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might come in
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) were paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had no objection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would not be
ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) eyes were towards Donwell as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) walked, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ladies were all at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had never rejoiced at the sound
before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,
with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of
deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.

<p/>There was a bustle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) approach; a good deal of moving and talking.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the
maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would be pleased to wait a
moment, and then ushered her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both
escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had a distinct glimpse of,
looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heard
Miss Bates saying, <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid down upon
the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) did not
quite understand what was going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid Jane is not very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but I do not know; they
_tell_ me she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,
Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I am
very little able--Have you a chair, ma’am? Do you sit where you like? I
am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) will be here presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma seriously hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a moment's fear of Miss Bates
keeping away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). But Miss Bates soon came--<div class="bookquote">``Very happy and
obliged'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>--but Emma's conscience told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) that there was not the same
cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. A very
friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hoped, might lead the way to a
return of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.

<p/>``Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and
are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in
me---LRB-twinkling away a tear or two-RRB---but it will be very trying for us
to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), after having had her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) so long, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has a dreadful
headache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, you
know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. `My dear,' said
I, `you will blind yourself'--for tears were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) eyes perpetually.
One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no
young woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think us
ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune---LRB-again
dispersing her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tears-RRB---but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a
headache she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel
any blessing quite as it may deserve. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is as low as possible. To
look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), nobody would think how delighted and happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is to have
secured such a situation. You will excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) not coming to you--she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is
not able--she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is gone into her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own room--I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to lie down upon the
bed. `My dear,' said I, `I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:'
but, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is not; she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is walking about the room. But, now that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has written her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) letters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) shall soon be well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) will
be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your
kindness will excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite
ashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that
we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not
know any body was coming. `It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, `depend upon
it. Nobody else would come so early.' `Well,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), `it must be
borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' But then Patty
came in, and said it was you. `Oh!' said I, `it is Miss Woodhouse: I am
sure you will like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).'--`I can see nobody,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and
up she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you
waiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. `If you must go, my
dear,' said I, `you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the
bed.'''

<p/>Emma was most sincerely interested. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart had been long growing
kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) present sufferings acted
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nothing but
pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of
the past, obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on
seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) might not bear
to see herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) spoke as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) felt, with earnest regret and
solicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) collected
from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for
Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. <div class="bookquote">``It must be a severe
trial to them all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel
Campbell's return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So very kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Bates. <div class="bookquote">``But you are always kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no bearing such an <div class="bookquote">``always;''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>and to break through her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) dreadful
gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the charge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallridge</b></font>) three little girls--delightful children. Impossible that any
situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,
Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs. Smallridge is
intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four
miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
would not take a denial. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not let Jane say, `No;' for when Jane
first heard of it, -LRB-it was the day before yesterday, the very morning
we were at Donwell,-RRB- when Jane first heard of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite decided
against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly
as you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind to close with nothing till Colonel
Campbell's return, and nothing should induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to enter into any
engagement at present--and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) told Mrs. Elton over and over
again--and I am sure I had no more idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would change her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), saw
farther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in
such a kind way as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
positively declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as
Jane wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it
was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not
the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at once, that
upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallridge</b></font>)
had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it
till it was all settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon
the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. `You _must_
_all_ spend your evening with us,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--`I positively must have you
_all_ come.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley was there too, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not Mr. Knightley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) declined it from the first; and though I
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and
a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss
Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed
rather fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, is
fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have
enjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,
and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been
making up her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind the whole day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)

possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing
in the world that can make her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) happy in it. Except the Sucklings and
Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal
and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most
delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and as
to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there
are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with
such regard and kindness!--It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of
pleasure.--And her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) salary!--I really cannot venture to name her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) salary
to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would
hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``if other children are at all like what I

what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly
earned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so noble in your ideas!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within a

know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thoughts, and
say, Come ma’am, do not let us think about it any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends must all be sorry to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and will not Colonel and
Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) has engaged herself before their
return?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Jane says she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) first told me what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when
Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was
before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we were
just going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember
thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened
before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before
tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Poor old John, I
have a great regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven
years; and now, poor old man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the
rheumatic gout in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joints--I must go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to-day; and so will
Jane, I am sure, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) gets out at all. And poor John's son came to
talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is very well to do
himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing
of that sort, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father without some help;
and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) told us what John ostler had been
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>), and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to
Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened
before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this
circumstance was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>); but as without supposing it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's
going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.

<p/>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the
accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the
servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond
soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger,
however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had
sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable
account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) not to delay coming
back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having
resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) horse
seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the
Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy
going a good pace, and driving very steady.

<p/>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it
caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already
engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in
the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>); one was every thing, the
other nothing--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny,
and quite unconscious on what her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss
Bates's saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become
of that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--`You
must go,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). `You and I must part. You will have no business
here.--Let it stay, however,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); `give it houseroom till Colonel
Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will settle for
me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will help me out of all my difficulties.'--And to this day, I do
believe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) knows not whether it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) present or his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughter's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon allowed herself to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visit had been long enough;
and, with a repetition of every thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could venture to say of
the good wishes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) really felt, took leave.



<p/>CHAPTER IX


<p/>Emma's pensive meditations, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked home, were not interrupted;
but on entering the parlour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found those who must rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Mr.
Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absence, and were sitting
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner
decidedly graver than usual, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,
and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend
a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,
besides the `love,' which nobody carries?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had not forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked unlike himself. Time,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) that they ought to be friends
again. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father
began his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inquiries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my
worthy old friend and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) daughter?--I dare say they must have been very
much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.
and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is always so
attentive to them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a
smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at Mr.
Knightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) favour, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eyes received the truth from hers, and all that
had passed of good in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings were at once caught and honoured.--
He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a glow of regard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was warmly gratified--and in
another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common
friendliness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) part.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand;--whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not
herself made the first motion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not say--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might, perhaps,
have rather offered it--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, pressed it, and certainly
was on the point of carrying it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) lips--when, from some fancy or
other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) suddenly let it go.--Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should feel such a scruple, why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should change his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind when it was all but done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not
perceive.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have judged better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had not
stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it
happened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought nothing became him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) more.--It was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>),
of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not but recall the
attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left
them immediately afterwards--gone in a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always moved with the
alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed more sudden than usual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) disappearance.

<p/>Emma could not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having gone to Miss Bates, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure
to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither
would she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be going to Brunswick Square, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
knew how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happened
at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have been
pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could not
be deceived as to the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) countenance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) unfinished
gallantry;--it was all done to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had fully recovered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good opinion.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been sitting with them half an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
found. It was a pity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had not come back earlier!

<p/>In the hope of diverting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) father's thoughts from the disagreeableness
of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on
horseback, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
news of Jane Fairfax, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dependence on the effect was justified;
it supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
had long made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and
could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had
been an unexpected blow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is to be so comfortably
settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry
situation, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) health will be taken good care of. It ought to
be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.
You know, my dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor
was to us. And I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will be better off in one respect, and not be
induced to go away after it has been her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) home so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else
into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the
death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew had had no particular reason
to hasten back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not lived above six-and-thirty
hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any
thing foreboded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) general state, had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) off after a short
struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.

<p/>It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of
gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the
surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops
to folly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has nothing to do but to die; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) stoops to be
disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.
Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was
now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was fully
justified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The
event acquitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of
imaginary complaints.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been suffering a great deal:
more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try the
temper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) faults, what
would Mr. Churchill do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)? Mr. Churchill's loss would be
dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>--Even Mr.
Weston shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) head, and looked solemn, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor woman,
who would have thought it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>and resolved, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) mourning should be as
handsome as possible; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife sat sighing and moralising over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it
would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also
a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill,
the grief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband--her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mind glanced over them both with awe and
compassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might
be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw in a moment
all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have
nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wife, was feared
by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form
the attachment, as, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel
no certainty of its being already formed.

<p/>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.
What ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might feel of brighter hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) betrayed nothing. Emma
was gratified, to observe such a proof in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of strengthened character,
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.
They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual
forbearance.

<p/>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all
that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill
was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the
departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very
old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a
visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for
Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible
on Emma's side.

<p/>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose
prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements
now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had scarcely
a stronger regret than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) past coldness; and the person, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted
to be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); wanted to shew a value for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) society, and testify
respect and consideration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolved to prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to spend a day
at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused,
and by a verbal message. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Perry/Perry</b></font>)</div>and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own consent, by himself, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was suffering under severe
headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) doubt the
possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quite
gone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing
touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension
of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
undertaken more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was equal to, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt it so herself,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not own it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spirits seemed overcome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
present home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous
disorder:--confined always to one room;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could have wished it
otherwise--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good aunt, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) very old friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) must
acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that
description. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) care and attention could not be questioned; they were,
in fact, only too great. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived
more evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;
grieved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more and more, and looked around eager to discover some
way of being useful. To take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--be it only an hour or two--from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) change of air and scene, and quiet rational
conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good; and the
following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wrote again to say, in the most feeling language
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could command, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the carriage at any
hour that Jane would name--mentioning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had Mr. Perry's decided
opinion, in favour of such exercise for his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) patient. The answer was only
in this short note:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any
exercise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own note had deserved something better; but it was
impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed
indisposition so plainly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought only of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might best
counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the
answer, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,
in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)--but it would not
do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest
service--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in
vain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was
quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
worse.--Emma wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own powers;
but, almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.
<div class="bookquote">``Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any
body--any body at all--Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and
Mrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,
except them, Jane would really see nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,
and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could
she (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) feel any right of preference herself--she (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) submitted, therefore, and
only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece's appetite and diet,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates
was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any
thing:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing
they could command -LRB-and never had any body such good neighbours-RRB- was
distasteful.

<p/>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an
examination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality
was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half
an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss
Bates, but <div class="bookquote">``dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent
back; it was a thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not take--and, moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) insisted on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was not at all in want of any thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering
about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of
the very day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had, under the plea of being unequal to any
exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) in the carriage,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane was
resolved to receive no kindness from _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was sorry, very sorry.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable
from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and
inequality of powers; and it mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was given so little
credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the consolation of knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) intentions were good, and of
being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy
to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) even have seen
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to
reprove.



<p/>CHAPTER X


<p/>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was
called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who <div class="bookquote">``could not stay five minutes,
and wanted particularly to speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>--He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at the
parlour-door, and hardly asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, in the natural key of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be
possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) unwell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would have ordered the
carriage, and come to you, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must see you _alone_, and that you
know---LRB-nodding towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father-RRB---Humph!--Can you come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what
you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) really not
ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in
time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something
really important seemed announced by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks; but, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend was
well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walk now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Weston were soon out of
the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--<div class="bookquote">``now
Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gravely replied.--<div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me. I promised my wife to
leave it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will break it to you better than I can. Do not
be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Break it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, standing still with terror.--<div class="bookquote">``Good
God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick
Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed you are mistaken.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest
friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?--I charge you
by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Emma.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that
it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can be to be
_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very seriously, <div class="bookquote">``it does not. It is not in
the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of
Knightley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma's courage returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``in talking of its being _broke_ to you.
I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern
you--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my
dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't
say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much
worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must wait; and now it required little effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own fancy, and
that soon pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the probability of its being some money
concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the
circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond
had brought forward. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural
children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very
undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It inspired little more
than an animating curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that gentleman on horseback?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as they
proceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) secret,
than with any other view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I
assure you. You will not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is half way to Windsor by this
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has your son been with you, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded
and demure,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--<div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), as they entered the room--<div class="bookquote">``I have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and now I hope you
will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in
delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--And Emma distinctly
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) add, in a lower tone, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) quitted the room,--<div class="bookquote">``I have
been as good as my word. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has not the least idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,
that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
eagerly said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I
find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have been
walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense.
Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your
distress, whatever it may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you indeed no idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to
hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right. It does relate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), and I will tell you directly;''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) work, and seeming resolved against looking up.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has
been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is
impossible to express our surprize. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father on a
subject,--to announce an attachment--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of
Harriet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More than an attachment, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>resumed Mrs. Weston; <div class="bookquote">``an
engagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will
any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are
engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well be amazed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) eyes,
and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--
<div class="bookquote">``You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn
engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, and
kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but
themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) family, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).--It is so
wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost
incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind was divided between two
ideas--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own former conversations with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) about Miss Fairfax; and
poor Harriet;--and for some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could only exclaim, and require
confirmation, repeated confirmation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at last, trying to recover herself; <div class="bookquote">``this is a
circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at
all comprehend it. What!--engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) all the winter--before either
of them came to Highbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very
much. It has hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conduct we
cannot excuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, <div class="bookquote">``I will not pretend _not_ to
understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured
that no such effect has followed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) attentions to me, as you are
apprehensive of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as
steady as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my
present perfect indifference,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I will farther tell you,
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I
did like him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), when I was very much disposed to be attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)--nay,
was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.
Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,
for at least these three months, cared nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). You may
believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) with tears of joy; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could find
utterance, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), that this protestation had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) more good
than any thing else in the world could do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``On
this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you
might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--
Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful
wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)_, Mrs. Weston;
and I must say, that I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) greatly to blame. What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners
so _very_ disengaged? What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to endeavour to please, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering
attention, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) certainly did--while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) really belonged to
another?--How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) tell what mischief he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might be doing?--How could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) tell that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might not be making me in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)?--very wrong,
very wrong indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how could _she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!
to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,
before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,
which I can neither comprehend nor respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) said so expressly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had not time to enter into much explanation. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was here only a
quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow
the full use even of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could stay--but that there had been
misunderstandings he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,
seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very
possibly arise from the impropriety of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) conduct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, much
beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), I cannot say how it has sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!--None of that upright
integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of
trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been wrong
in this instance, I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long enough to answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having
many, very many, good qualities; and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, not attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Smallridge, too!
Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mean by
such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to engage herself--to suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
even to think of such a measure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--or at
least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--Till yesterday, I
know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the dark as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plans. They burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I do
not know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to come forward at once, own it all to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle, throw himself on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of
concealment that had been carrying on so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma began to listen better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Weston. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me at
parting, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should soon write; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke in a manner which
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let
us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It
may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to
be understood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to
condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Let us have patience. I must love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and now that I am
satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious
for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must
both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and
concealment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ sufferings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma dryly, <div class="bookquote">``do not appear to have done him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most favourably for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew--gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) consent with scarcely a
difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!
While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a
hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) remains at rest in
the family vault, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite
to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue
influence does not survive the grave!--He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) consent with very
little persuasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>thought Emma, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have done as much for Harriet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this
morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and
then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle,
to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was very much
agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) appear quite
a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) before.--In
addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) so
very unwell, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had had no previous suspicion of--and there was
every appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) having been feeling a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such
perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of
the engagement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None; not one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) positively said that it had been known to no being in
the world but their two selves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the
idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a
very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of
hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us with
professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret
to judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,
completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth
and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been
carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and
words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the
consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not
perfectly agreeable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite easy on that head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Weston. <div class="bookquote">``I am very sure
that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not
have heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you
imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss
Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and
as to speaking ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), there I must have been safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,
evidently on the watch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a look which invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
in; and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was coming round, added, <div class="bookquote">``Now, dearest Emma, let me
intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart at ease,
and incline him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of
it--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) favour. It
is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,
why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), for
Frank, I mean, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) should have attached himself to a girl of such
steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
credit for--and still am disposed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) credit for, in spite of
this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may
be said in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation for even that error!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma feelingly. ``If a woman can ever be
excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane
Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the world is not their's,
nor the world's law.'''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) met Mr. Weston on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) entrance, with a smiling countenance,
exclaiming,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a
device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of
guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half
your property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of
condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate
you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the
most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>A glance or two between him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that all was as
right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) spirits was
immediate. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) shook
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in
a manner to prove, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) now only wanted time and persuasion to think
the engagement no very bad thing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) companions suggested only what
could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they
had talked it all over together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had talked it all over again
with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was become perfectly
reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank
could possibly have done.



<p/>CHAPTER XI


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet, poor Harriet!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Those were the words; in them lay the
tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted
the real misery of the business to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Frank Churchill had behaved very
ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)_
behaviour as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) _own_, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). It was the
scrape which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into on Harriet's account, that gave the
deepest hue to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the
dupe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken
prophetically, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) once said, <div class="bookquote">``Emma, you have been no friend
to Harriet Smith.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) nothing but
disservice.--It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not to charge herself, in this
instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of
the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise
never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had ever
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a hint on the subject; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt completely guilty
of having encouraged what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have repressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have
prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) influence
would have been enough. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought
to have prevented them.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been risking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend's
happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to tell Harriet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must not allow herself to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
and that there were five hundred chances to one against his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ever caring
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``But, with common sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I have had
little to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was extremely angry with herself. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not have been angry
with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane
Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) might at least relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) feelings from any present
solicitude on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) need
no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health
having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
days of insignificance and evil were over.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would soon be well, and
happy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own attentions
had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No
doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been a rival;
and well might any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could offer of assistance or regard be
repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,
and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>)
understood it all; and as far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind could disengage itself from
the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) acknowledged that
Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
desert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little
sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful
that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.
Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and
judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing
reserve and self-command, it would.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must communicate the painful
truth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had
been among Mr. Weston's parting words. <div class="bookquote">``For the present, the whole
affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of
it, as a token of respect to the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had so very recently lost;
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--Emma had
promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) superior duty.

<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) vexation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not help feeling it almost
ridiculous, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should have the very same distressing and delicate
office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by
herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) heart beat quick
on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) supposed, had poor Mrs.
Weston felt when _she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)_ was approaching Randalls. Could the event of
the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately,
there could be no chance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Woodhouse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--<div class="bookquote">``is
not this the oddest news that ever was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What news do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or
voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you
need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me
himself. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) just now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told me it was to be a great secret;
and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said you knew it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Mr. Weston tell you?'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--said Emma, still perplexed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill
are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one
another this long while. How very odd!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,
that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) character appeared
absolutely changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or
disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), quite unable to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you any idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)?--You,
perhaps, might.--You -LRB-blushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) spoke-RRB- who can see into every
body's heart; but nobody else--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I begin to doubt my having any such talent.
Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attached
to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not
openly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never
had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank
Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very
sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. <div class="bookquote">``Why should you caution
me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied
Emma, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and
not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you
did care about him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>turning away distressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, after a moment's pause--<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?--Good
Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not speak another word.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voice was lost; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat down,
waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.

<p/>Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), did not immediately say any thing; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did speak, it was
in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have thought it possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``that you could have
misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--but considering
how infinitely superior he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is to every body else, I should not have
thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.
Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) in
the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of
Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) side. And that you should
have been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that
you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I
should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,
to dare to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). At first, if you had not told me that more
wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater
disparity -LRB-those were your very words-RRB-;--I should not have dared to
give way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who
had been always acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--<div class="bookquote">``Let us understand
each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you
speaking of--Mr. Knightley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--and so
I thought you knew. When we talked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), it was as clear as
possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>returned Emma, with forced calmness, <div class="bookquote">``for all that you then
said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost
assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service
Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the
gipsies, was spoken of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on
the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;
that considering the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had rendered you, it was extremely
natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to
your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had
been in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is
strong on my memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``now I recollect what you mean; but I
was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the
gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! -LRB-with some
elevation-RRB- I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.
Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not
stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That
was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that
was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was to every
other being upon earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``this has been a most unfortunate--most
deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At
least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the
other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resumed, <div class="bookquote">``that you should feel a
great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must
think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But
I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may
appear--. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful
things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than
between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such
a thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so
fortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if
_he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will
not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But
you are too good for that, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in consternation, and hastily said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--<div class="bookquote">``I must say that I
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat silently meditating,
in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient
for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart. A mind like hers,
once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) touched--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
admitted--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse
that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank
Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having
some hope of a return? It darted through her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), with the speed of an
arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own conduct, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the same
few minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) before. How improperly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) been acting by Harriet! How
inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) on! It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
with dreadful force, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was ready to give it every bad name in the
world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all
these demerits--some concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own appearance, and a strong sense
of justice by Harriet---LRB-there would be no need of _compassion_ to the
girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,-RRB- gave Emma the
resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent
kindness.--For her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost
extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done
nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily
formed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose
counsels had never led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore,
and subduing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) emotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) turned to Harriet again, and, in a more
inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which
had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was
quite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and
themselves.

<p/>Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad
to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and
such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give
the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's
tremblings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened, were better concealed than
Harriet's, but they were not less. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) voice was not unsteady; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such
a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing
emotions, must create.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) listened with much inward suffering, but
with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well
arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it
contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of
the narration, a substance to sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spirit--especially with the
corroborating circumstances, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own memory brought in favour of
Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.

<p/>Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) behaviour ever since
those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had, on that occasion,
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) much superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expectation. From that evening, or at
least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>),
Harriet had begun to be sensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
had been used to do, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) having indeed quite a different manner
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been
more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had so often come and walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and talked so very
delightfully!--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed to want to be acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Emma knew it
to have been very much the case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had often observed the change, to
almost the same extent.--Harriet repeated expressions of approbation
and praise from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement
with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had known of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) opinion of Harriet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for
being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,
feelings.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw such recommendations in Harriet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
had dwelt on them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's
memory, many little particulars of the notice she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had received from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment
implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,
by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,
and contained multiplied proofs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) who had seen them, had passed
undiscerned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to
be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without
some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) walking
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they
had been walking some time before Emma came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had taken pains -LRB-as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was convinced-RRB- to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the rest to himself--and at first,
he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in a more particular way than he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had ever done
before, in a very particular way indeed!---LRB-Harriet could not recall
it without a blush.-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) seemed to be almost asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
affections were engaged.--But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) -LRB-Miss Woodhouse-RRB- appeared
likely to join them, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) changed the subject, and began talking about
farming:--The second, was his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) having sat talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nearly half
an hour before Emma came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visit, the very last morning of
his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) being at Hartfield--though, when he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) first came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could not stay five minutes--and his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) having told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), during their
conversation, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) must go to London, it was very much against
his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) inclination that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) left home at all, which was much more -LRB-as
Emma felt-RRB- than he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had acknowledged to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_. The superior degree of
confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
severe pain.

<p/>On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did, after a
little reflection, venture the following question. ``Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not?--Is
not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of
your affections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might have
Mr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with
spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I
know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>When Harriet had closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dear Miss
Woodhouse, to say whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not good ground for hope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never should have presumed to think of it at first,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but
for you. You told me to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) carefully, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) behaviour
be the rule of mine--and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may
deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does chuse me, it will not be any thing so
very wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,
made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to say
on reply,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last
man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) really does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet seemed ready to worship her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend for a sentence so
satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which
at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
father's footsteps. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was coming through the hall. Harriet was too
much agitated to encounter him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not compose herself--
Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had better go;'' (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>--with most ready
encouragement from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) passed off through another
door--and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of
Emma's feelings: <div class="bookquote">``Oh God! that I had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
thoughts.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had
rushed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a
fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
been thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the
blindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own head and heart!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked about,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried the shrubbery--in every place, every
posture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had acted most weakly; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of
wretchedness.

<p/>To understand, thoroughly understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart, was the first
endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's
claims on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.

<p/>How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as every feeling
declared him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) now to be? When had his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) influence, such influence begun?--
When had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) succeeded to that place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection, which Frank
Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked back;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--and as
they must at any time have been compared by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), had it--oh! had it, by
any blessed felicity, occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), to institute the comparison.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
saw that there never had been a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not consider Mr.
Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not
been infinitely the most dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw, that in persuading herself,
in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been entirely under a
delusion, totally ignorant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart--and, in short, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!

<p/>This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was
the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reached; and without being long in reaching it.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was most
sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection for Mr. Knightley.--Every other part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind
was disgusting.

<p/>With insufferable vanity had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed herself in the secret of every
body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every
body's destiny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was proved to have been universally mistaken; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not quite done nothing--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had done mischief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) too much feared, on Mr.
Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
attachment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of
Harriet's;--and even were this not the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would never have known
Harriet at all but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) folly.

<p/>Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every
wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax
became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no
surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or
thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
side! Such a debasement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)! It was horrible to Emma to think how it
must sink him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers,
the merriment it would prompt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expense; the mortification and
disdain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could
it be?--No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from
impossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities
to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one, perhaps
too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?--Was
it new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent,
incongruous--or for chance and circumstance -LRB-as second causes-RRB- to direct
the human fate?

<p/>Oh! had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never brought Harriet forward! Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
ought, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought!--Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not, with a
folly which no tongue could express, prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) marrying the
unexceptionable young man who would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happy and respectable
in the line of life to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to belong--all would have been
safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.

<p/>How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts to
Mr. Knightley!--How she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such
a man till actually assured of it!--But Harriet was less humble, had
fewer scruples than formerly.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inferiority, whether of mind or
situation, seemed little felt.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had seemed more sensible of Mr.
Elton's being to stoop in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) now seemed of Mr.
Knightley's.--Alas! was not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own doing too? Who had been at
pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but
herself had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to elevate herself if possible,
and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--If
Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doing too.



<p/>CHAPTER XII


<p/>Till now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known
how much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,
first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling
it her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) due, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the
dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had
been.--Long, very long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been first; for, having no
female connexions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) own, there had been only Isabella whose claims
could be compared with hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had always known exactly how far
he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) loved and esteemed Isabella. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had herself been first with him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) for
many years past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had not deserved it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had often been negligent
or perverse, slighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) advice, or even wilfully opposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>),
insensible of half his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) merits, and quarrelling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) would
not acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) false and insolent estimate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own--but still,
from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)
had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) from a girl, with an endeavour to
improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and an anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) doing right, which no other creature
had at all shared. In spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) faults, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was dear
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>); might she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope,
however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not
presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy
of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.
_She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)_ could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not flatter herself with any idea of
blindness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)_. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had received a very recent
proof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) been by her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) behaviour to
Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
on the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too
strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and
clear-sighted goodwill.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had no hope, nothing to deserve the name
of hope, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could have that sort of affection for herself which was
now in question; but there was a hope -LRB-at times a slight one, at
times much stronger,-RRB- that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be
overrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) regard for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)_.--Wish it she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sake--be the
consequence nothing to herself, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) remaining single all his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) life.
Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) be secure of that, indeed, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) never marrying at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) but continue the
same Mr. Knightley to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, the same Mr. Knightley to
all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious
intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) peace would be
fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). It would be
incompatible with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, and with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) felt
for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Nothing should separate her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) would not
marry, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) were asked by Mr. Knightley.

<p/>It must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
hoped, that when able to see them together again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might at least
be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should see them
henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had
hitherto misunderstood even those she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was watching, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not know how
to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be blinded here.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was expected back every
day. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it
appeared when her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
resolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good,
it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was
resolved not to be convinced, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could doubt, and yet had
no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to
irritate.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_
topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed
to pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
objected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they
had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and
approved, and was grateful.

<p/>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's
thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,
sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had
been calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>)
way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to
relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.

<p/>Mr. Weston had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having then
induced Miss Fairfax to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in an airing, was now returned with
much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter
of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of
awkward feelings, could have afforded.

<p/>A little curiosity Emma had; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made the most of it while her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal
of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all
at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and
to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.
Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as,
considering every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought such a visit could not be paid
without leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
was extremely anxious to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation to Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;
or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for <div class="bookquote">``such things,''
 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) observed, <div class="bookquote">``always got about.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston
had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn
how deeply she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt
satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a
gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly
respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;
thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of
themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss
Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to
invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to an airing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had drawn back and declined at first, but,
on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,
Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
embarrassment, as to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to converse on the important subject.
Apologies for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception,
and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was always feeling
towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but
when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the
present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was
convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
companion, pent up within her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own mind as every thing had so long been,
and was very much pleased with all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had said on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the misery of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had suffered, during the concealment of so
many months,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was energetic. This was one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) expressions. `I will not say, that since I entered into the
engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have
never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip,
Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thinks herself wrong, then, for having
consented to a private engagement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is disposed
to blame herself. `The consequence,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), `has been a state of
perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment
that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no
expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all
my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken,
and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me
ought not to be.' `Do not imagine, madam,' she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) continued, `that I was
taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the
care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own;
and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances
may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel
Campbell.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma again. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) then excessively, I
suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could be
led to form the engagement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) affection must have overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
judgment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being extremely attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>returned Emma, sighing, <div class="bookquote">``that I must often have
contributed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
probably had something of that in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thoughts, when alluding to the
misunderstandings which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had given us hints of before. One natural
consequence of the evil she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had involved herself in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``was
that of making her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done
amiss, had exposed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to a thousand inquietudes, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) captious
and irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to bear. `I did not make the allowances,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), `which I ought
to have done, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) temper and spirits--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) delightful spirits, and
that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other
circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to
me, as they were at first.' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) then began to speak of you, and of the
great kindness you had shewn her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) during her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) illness; and with a blush
which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had
an opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every
wish and every endeavour to do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was sensible that you had
never received any proper acknowledgment from herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be happy now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, seriously, <div class="bookquote">``which,
in spite of every little drawback from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scrupulous conscience, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there
were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss
Fairfax!--Well -LRB-checking herself, and trying to be more lively-RRB-, this
is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting
particulars. They shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to the greatest advantage. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is
very good--I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune
should be on his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought
well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
very much, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) defence was, therefore, earnest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) talked with a
great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had too much
to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or
to Donwell; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended
with, <div class="bookquote">``We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know,
but I hope it will soon come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was obliged to pause before she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could at
all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you well, my Emma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Weston's parting question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me
intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for
unpleasant reflection, by increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) esteem and compassion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bitterly regretted
not having sought a closer acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and blushed for the
envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention
to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) due; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
better; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) done her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) part towards intimacy; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) endeavoured
to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must, in all
probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
now.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as
an associate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), to be received with gratitude; and the other--what
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this
important matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ought, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must have been preserved from the
abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so
unpardonably imparted; an idea which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) greatly feared had been made a
subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the
levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil
surrounding the former, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) coming to Highbury, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was persuaded
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must herself have been the worst. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must have been a
perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on
Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no
more.

<p/>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.
The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and
nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was
despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights
the longer visible.

<p/>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could only be kept tolerably
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's side, and by
exertions which had never cost her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) half so much before. It reminded
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's
wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea,
and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of
Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly
be over. The picture which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had then drawn of the privations of the
approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,
no pleasures had been lost.--But her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) present forebodings she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) feared
would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) now,
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--that
might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that
might take place among the circle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) friends, Hartfield must be
comparatively deserted; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) left to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father with the
spirits only of ruined happiness.

<p/>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than
herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.
They should lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and, probably, in great measure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband
also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss
Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to
Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.
All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the
loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or
of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer
coming there for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) evening comfort!--No longer walking in at all
hours, as if ever willing to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own home for their's!--How was
it to be endured? And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake;
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first,
the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked for all the best
blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but
the reflection never far distant from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, that it had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
own work?

<p/>When it came to such a pitch as this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not able to refrain from
a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a
few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation
or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own better
conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might
be the following and every future winter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life to the past, it
would yet find her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more rational, more acquainted with herself, and
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) less to regret when it were gone.



<p/>CHAPTER XIII


<p/>The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and
the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at
Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a
softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was
summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma
resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite
sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after
a storm, been more attractive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) longed for the serenity they
might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after
dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lost no time
in hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, and
thoughts a little relieved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had taken a few turns, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Mr.
Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--It
was the first intimation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being returned from London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had
been thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles
distant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
must be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The
<div class="bookquote">``How d’ye do's''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>were quiet and constrained on each side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked after
their mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left them?--Only
that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) meant to walk with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had just looked into the dining-room, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was
not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) neither
looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,
suggested by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fears, was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had perhaps been communicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
plans to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had
been received.

<p/>They walked together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was often looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and trying for a fuller view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face than it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to
give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment to Harriet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might be watching for
encouragement to begin.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not, could not, feel equal to lead the
way to any such subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must do it all himself. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could
not bear this silence. With him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) it was most unnatural. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
considered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather
surprize you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) quietly, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``of what nature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) intended to say no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that
already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) glowing cheeks towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); for, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might have called
at Mrs. Goddard's in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and
at the end of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave me a brief account of what had happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more
composure,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have
had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give
me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but---LRB-with a sinking voice
and a heavy sigh-RRB- I seem to have been doomed to blindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was unsuspicious of having
excited any particular interest, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm drawn within
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), and pressed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) heart, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thus saying, in a tone
of great sensibility, speaking low,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent
sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allow
yourself--.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm was pressed again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) added, in a more
broken and subdued accent, <div class="bookquote">``The feelings of the warmest
friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--And in a louder,
steadier tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) concluded with, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) will soon be gone. They will soon
be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) deserves a better fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could recover from the flutter
of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--
I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was
going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed
of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may
well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason
to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), looking eagerly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you, indeed?'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--but
checking himself--<div class="bookquote">``No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased
that you can say even so much.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is no object of regret, indeed! and
it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment
of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not
farther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure
myself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain that
there was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to
deserve.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be rewarded
with that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable
creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--<div class="bookquote">``I
am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your
error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I
have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been
at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural
for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I never
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) listened in perfect silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would
not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must say more before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) were entitled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on, however.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story,
probably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of my
sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up
as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was the son of Mr. Weston--he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was continually here--I always found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very pleasant--and, in short, for -LRB-with a sigh-RRB- let me swell out the
causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanity
was flattered, and I allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) attentions. Latterly, however--for some
time, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought
them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has imposed on me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has not injured me. I have never been
attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). And now I can tolerably comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) behaviour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) real
situation with another.--It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) object to blind all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and
no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--except
that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I
was somehow or other safe from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
conduct was at least intelligible; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent; and, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) usual tone,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,
however, that I may have underrated him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). My acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has
been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hitherto, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has a chance.--I have no
motive for wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ill--and for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sake, whose happiness will be
involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of their being happy together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``I believe
them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a most fortunate man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. <div class="bookquote">``So
early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a
wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such
a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,
has before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested
love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) disinterestedness;
every thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as
regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;
equality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felicity, for it
will be his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to bestow the only advantages she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) wants.--A man would always
wish to give a woman a better home than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)_ regard, must,
I think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the
favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) good.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) meets
with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affection, cannot even
weary her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by negligent treatment--and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) family sought
round the world for a perfect wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), they could not have found
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) superior.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt is in the way.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt dies.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has only to
speak.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) friends are eager to promote his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) happiness.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had used
every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is a
fortunate man indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak as if you envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I do envy him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), Emma. In one respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is the object of my envy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence
of Harriet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if
possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) plan; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would speak of something totally
different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) only waited for
breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), by saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I
see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma,
I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the
next moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eagerly cried. <div class="bookquote">``Take a
little time, consider, do not commit yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), in an accent of deep mortification, and not
another syllable followed.

<p/>Emma could not bear to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was wishing to confide in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--perhaps to consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>);--cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) what it would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would listen.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) resolution, or reconcile him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might give
just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own independence,
relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) from that state of indecision, which must be more
intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).--They had
reached the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going in, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) still spoke--<div class="bookquote">``I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not
gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, after proceeding a few steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added--<div class="bookquote">``I stopped you
ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you
pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or
to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as
a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. I
will tell you exactly what I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a friend!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>--repeated Mr. Knightley.--<div class="bookquote">``Emma, that I fear is a
word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--I
have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your
offer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to
you as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) earnestness to look the question, and the expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eyes overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for dearest you will always be, whatever
the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved
Emma--tell me at once. Say `No,' if it is to be said.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could
really say nothing.--<div class="bookquote">``You are silent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cried, with great animation;
<div class="bookquote">``absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The
dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most
prominent feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot make speeches, Emma:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon resumed; and in a tone of
such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably
convincing.--<div class="bookquote">``If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it
more. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I
have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other
woman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I would
tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The
manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have
been a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see,
you understand my feelings--and will return them if you can. At present,
I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful
velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to
catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's
hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a
delusion as any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own--that Harriet was nothing; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was every
thing herself; that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been saying relative to Harriet
had been all taken as the language of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own feelings; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
agitation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doubts, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reluctance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) discouragement, had been all
received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time
for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there
was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and
to resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could now render her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of
sentiment which might have prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the
two--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at
once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not
marry them both, Emma had it not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt for Harriet, with pain and
with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that
could be probable or reasonable, entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for ever; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
judgment was as strong as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feelings, and as strong as it had ever
been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as most unequal
and degrading. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spoke
then, on being so entreated.--What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) say?--Just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought,
of course. A lady always does.--She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said enough to shew there need not
be despair--and to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to say more himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) _had_ despaired at
one period; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received such an injunction to caution and silence,
as for the time crushed every hope;--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had begun by refusing to hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) proposal of
taking another turn, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) renewing the conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
just put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt its
inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it,
and seek no farther explanation.

<p/>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;
seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a
little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is
mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.
Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had come,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no
selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) an
opening, to soothe or to counsel her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--The rest had been the work of
the moment, the immediate effect of what he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) heard, on his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) feelings. The
delightful assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) total indifference towards Frank Churchill,
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having a heart completely disengaged from him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), had given birth
to the hope, that, in time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might gain her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection himself;--but
it had been no present hope--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had only, in the momentary conquest of
eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not forbid his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
attempt to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--The superior hopes which gradually opened were
so much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been asking
to be allowed to create, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could, was already his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)!--Within half
an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to
something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.

<p/>_Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same
precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same
degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) side, there had been
a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,
of Frank Churchill.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank
Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably
enlightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as to the other. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) jealousy of Frank Churchill
that had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) on going away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would save himself from witnessing again
such permitted, encouraged attentions.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had gone to learn to be
indifferent.--But he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had gone to a wrong place. There was too much
domestic happiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form
in it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking
inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), for much to have been done, even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) time been longer.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had
stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's
post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladness
which must be felt, nay, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not scruple to feel, having never
believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much
fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could stay no
longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly
after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures,
faultless in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) faults, bore the discovery.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--
He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Frank Churchill's
character was not desperate.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own Emma, by hand and word,
when they returned into the house; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could have thought of Frank
Churchill then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might have deemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) a very good sort of fellow.



<p/>CHAPTER XIV


<p/>What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had brought out!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had then been only daring to hope for
a little respite of suffering;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was now in an exquisite flutter of
happiness, and such happiness moreover as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed must still be
greater when the flutter should have passed away.

<p/>They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--how often
it had been collected!--and how often had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes fallen on the same
shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the
western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing
like it; and it was with difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could summon enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive
daughter.

<p/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in the
breast of that man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously
hoping might not have taken cold from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ride.--Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) have seen the
heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the
most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest
perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had
received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment,
totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in return.

<p/>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to be a little tranquillised and
subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax
for such an evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found one or two such very serious points
to consider, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feel, that even her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) happiness must have some
alloy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father--and Harriet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not be alone without feeling
the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort
of both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father,
it was a question soon answered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley
would ask; but a very short parley with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart produced the most
solemn resolution of never quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) even wept over
the idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived, it must be only an
engagement; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of
drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) away, it might become an increase of comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).--How
to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spare
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from any unnecessary pain; how to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) any possible atonement;
how to appear least her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) enemy?--On these subjects, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) perplexity
and distress were very great--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind had to pass again and
again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever
surrounded it.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could only resolve at last, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would still
avoid a meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and communicate all that need be told by
letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) removed
just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme
more--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;
and a few weeks spent in London must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) some amusement.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did
not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty
and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate,
it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom
every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the
evil day, when they must all be together again.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) rose early, and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) letter to Harriet; an employment which
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking
up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half
an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>),
literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in a
proper share of the happiness of the evening before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had not left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) long, by no means long enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to have the
slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) guessed what it
must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was now
in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wanted no explanations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
wanted only to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts to herself--and as for understanding
any thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wrote, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was incapable of it.--It must be
waded through, however. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) opened the packet; it was too surely so;--a
note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to
Mrs. Weston.

<p/>``I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the
enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely
a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree
about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We
are quite well.--This letter has been the cure of all the little
nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks
on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never
own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east
wind.--I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday
afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last
night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) ill.

<p/>``Yours ever,
<div class="bookquote">``A. W.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-To Mrs. Weston.-RSB-


<p/>WINDSOR-JULY.
MY DEAR MADAM,

<p/>``If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be
expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and
indulgence.--You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of
even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--But
I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage
rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be
humble. I have already met with such success in two applications for
pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,
and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You
must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I
first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which
was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place
myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.
I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it a right,
I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and
casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) openly; my
difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to
require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we
parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the
creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--Had she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) refused, I
should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your
hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--To any thing, every
thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,
perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of
good was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,
I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and
the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no
inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See
me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to
Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have
been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till
Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you
will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by
reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that so long as I absented myself from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house, so long
I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the very
happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to
reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come to the principal,
the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which
excites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. With
the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss
Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest
humiliation.--A few words which dropped from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yesterday spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour
to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to
assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than
an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately
thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but
I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been
convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) indifference, I would not have been induced by any
selfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,
was as much my conviction as my wish.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) received my attentions with
an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.
We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those
attentions were her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse
began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,
I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), I remember that I was
within a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was not
without suspicion; but I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) having since detected me,
at least in some degree.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) may not have surmised the whole, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it
did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wholly by surprize. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) frequently gave me hints of it.
I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attentions to Miss Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conduct
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation
of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against
Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and
procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes
of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly
affection, as to long to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) as deeply and as happily in love as
myself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,
you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to
get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.
If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--Of
the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that
its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never
have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).--The
delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,
is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly
hope, know her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) must tell you herself what she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is--yet not by word, for never
was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own
merit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,
I have heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).--She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) gives a good account of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own health; but
as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion
of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) looks. I know you will soon call on her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is living in dread
of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without
delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few
minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and
I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or
misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:
but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and how little
I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
again!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me
to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard
all that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail
yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness
with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event
of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the
happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,
but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to
lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and
refinement.--But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) had entered
into with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off
abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over
the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of
my letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying
retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that
my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly
blameable. _She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My
plea of concealing the truth she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) did not think sufficient.--She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) was
displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), on a thousand
occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) even
cold. But she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) was always right. If I had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) judgment, and
subdued my spirits to the level of what she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) deemed proper, I should have
escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--
Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;
I met her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
would not suffer it. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) absolutely refused to allow me, which I then
thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very
natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the
world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable
particularity to another woman, was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be consenting the next to a
proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we
been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must
have been suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,
provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been
impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resentment in
a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dear
madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) side, abominable on mine; and
I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with
you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with
her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to
be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
coldness, and I went away determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) should make the first
advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of
the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly
suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
found I was really gone from Randalls, she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) closed with the offer of that
officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), by the
bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel
with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards
myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it
which that woman has known.--`Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I
have not yet indulged myself in calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) by that name, even to you.
Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between
the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the
insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon
have done.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) closed with this offer, resolving to break with me
entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet
again.--_She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_
_repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_: _she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This
letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I
answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the
multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of
being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in
my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but
a few lines, to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), remained without any uneasiness.--I was
rather disappointed that I did not hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) again speedily; but I
made excuses for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerful
in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and two
days afterwards I received a parcel from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), my own letters all
returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) last; and
adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,
and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate
arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) now sent me, by a safe
conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly
command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would
forward them after that period to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) at--: in short, the full direction
to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the
name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had
been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character
which I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to possess; and the secrecy she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had maintained, as to
any such design in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) former letter, was equally descriptive of its
anxious delicacy. For the world would not she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) have seemed to threaten
me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my
own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to be
done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. Without his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) sanction I
could not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were
in my favour; the late event had softened away his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pride, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was,
earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;
and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished I
might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done.--I
felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity
me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for my
suspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached
Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Do not pity me till I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
wan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my
knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance
of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was not
disappointed either in the object of my journey. A great deal of very
reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is
done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's
uneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I will
release you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a thousand
thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for
the attentions your heart will dictate towards her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>).--If you think me in
a way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss
W. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is right.--In one
respect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe
myself,

<p/>Your obliged and affectionate Son,

<p/>F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.



<p/>CHAPTER XV


<p/>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged, in
spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the
justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own name,
it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,
and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject
could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) former regard
for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of
love must have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at that moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never stopt till she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had gone
through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had
been wrong, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been less wrong than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had supposed--and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had
suffered, and was very sorry--and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and
so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was so happy herself, that
there was no being severe; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) have entered the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must
have shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) as heartily as ever.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to read it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to
be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so
much to blame in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very glad to look it over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but it seems long. I
will take it home with me at night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)
must return it by him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather be talking to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``but as it seems a
matter of justice, it shall be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, <div class="bookquote">``Had I been offered
the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother-in-law a few
months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a
smile, observed, <div class="bookquote">``Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
way. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be
severe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be natural for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) added shortly afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``to speak my
opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.
It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. I should wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Knightley returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reading with greater alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) trifles here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as to the temptation. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is wrong,
and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ought not to have formed the
engagement.--`His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father's disposition:'--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is unjust, however, to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) upright
and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not come till Miss
Fairfax was here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have not forgotten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``how sure you were that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might
have come sooner if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would. You pass it over very handsomely--but you
were perfectly right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had
_you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) came to Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was obliged to read the whole of it
aloud--all that related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), with a smile; a look; a shake of the
head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as
the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady
reflection, thus--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous
game. Too much indebted to the event for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) acquittal.--No judge of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own wishes, and
regardless of little besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own convenience.--Fancying you to have
fathomed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) secret. Natural enough!--his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own mind full of intrigue,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert
the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more
and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each
other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not give any sincere explanation of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did so, but very soon stopt again to say, <div class="bookquote">``the pianoforte! Ah! That
was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether
the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A
boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a
woman any proof of affection which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would rather dispense
with; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have prevented the instrument's
coming if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>After this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's
confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for
more than a word in passing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I perfectly agree with you, sir,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--was then his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) remark. <div class="bookquote">``You did behave
very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>And having gone through
what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) made a fuller pause to say, <div class="bookquote">``This is very bad.--He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
to place herself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and
uneasiness, and it should have been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first object to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from
suffering unnecessarily.--She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have had much more to contend
with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have
respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were
all reasonable. We must look to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) one fault, and remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
should have been in such a state of punishment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew
uncomfortable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own behaviour had been so very improper! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) next look. It was all read,
however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,
excepting one momentary glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), instantly withdrawn, in the fear
of giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the
Eltons,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) next observation.--<div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings are natural.--What!
actually resolve to break with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entirely!--She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt the engagement to
be a source of repentance and misery to each--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dissolved it.--What a
view this gives of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour!--Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be a most
extraordinary--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.
```Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--a
dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the
bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even of
Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter
the man writes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does seem to have suffered in
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being fond of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). `Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may long continue to
feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a very liberal
thanker, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I
deserve.' Come, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows himself there. `Miss Woodhouse calls me the
child of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--
And a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!
That was your name for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not appear so well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter as I am; but still
you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it. I
hope it does him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some service with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, certainly it does. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had great faults, faults of
inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion
in thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likely to be happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserves: but still as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it
may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I am very
ready to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character will improve, and acquire from hers the
steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk
to you of something else. I have another person's interest at present
so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.
Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work
on one subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike
English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was in love
with, how to be able to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), without attacking the
happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word.
<div class="bookquote">``While her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never quit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Part only of this answer, however,
was admitted. The impossibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, Mr.
Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any
other change, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not agree to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been thinking it over most
deeply, most intently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to
remove with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Donwell; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had wanted to believe it feasible, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to deceive himself
long; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) persuasion, that such a transplantation
would be a risk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's comfort, perhaps even of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life, which
must not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) felt
that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the
sacrifice of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) dearest Emma would not find in any
respect objectionable; it was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should be received at Hartfield;
that so long as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's happiness--in other words, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life--required
Hartfield to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) home, it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likewise.

<p/>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own passing
thoughts. Like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such
an alternative as this had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sensible of all
the affection it evinced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt that, in quitting Donwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must
be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that
in living constantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, and in no house of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, there
would be much, very much, to be borne with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised to think of it,
and advised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to think of it more; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was fully convinced, that no
reflection could alter his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishes or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinion on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
given it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), very long and calm consideration; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>)
thoughts to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure
William Larkins will not like it. You must get his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) consent before you
ask mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,
moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good
scheme.

<p/>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never
struck with any sense of injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nephew Henry, whose rights as
heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must
of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only
gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in
detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's
marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had
wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.

<p/>This proposal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), this plan of marrying and continuing at
Hartfield--the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) evils seemed to lessen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own advantages to increase, their mutual
good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the
periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)!--Such a partner in
all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of
melancholy!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend,
who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family
party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere
charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be a loser in
every way. Emma could not deplore her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) future absence as any deduction
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a
dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a
peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in such a state of
unmerited punishment.

<p/>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,
supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.
Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not
like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly
considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped
than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.



<p/>CHAPTER XVI


<p/>It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as
herself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by
letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!

<p/>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without
reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there
was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) style,
which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might be
only her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have
been quite without resentment under such a stroke.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting
to invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and
had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was
delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was
quite eager to have Harriet under her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) care.--When it was thus settled
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sister's side, Emma proposed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
very persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was invited for at least a
fortnight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was
all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick
Square.

<p/>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could
talk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense
of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), how much might
at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had led astray herself.

<p/>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps
an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must
be averting the past, and carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out of herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), one which _she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)_ only could be competent to make--the confession of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) engagement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have nothing to do with it
at present.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston
were safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this
period among those she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) loved--and the evil should not act on herself
by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of
leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating,
delight, should be hers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an
hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought
to go--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was longing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); the resemblance of their present
situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a
_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect
would certainly add to the interest with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should attend to any
thing Jane might communicate.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) went--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not
been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had
been in such distress as had filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) with compassion, though all the
worst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still
unwelcome, determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), though assured of their being at home, to
wait in the passage, and send up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) name.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heard Patty announcing
it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so
happily intelligible.--No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) heard nothing but the instant reply of,
<div class="bookquote">``Beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to walk up;'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and a moment afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was met on the stairs
by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
were felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) look so well, so lovely,
so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was
every thing which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very
feeling tone,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me
to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely
without words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the
sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), and made it expedient to compress all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) friendly and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.

<p/>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which
accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.
Elton elsewhere; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was in a humour to have patience with every
body; and as Mrs. Elton met her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with unusual graciousness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped the
rencontre would do them no harm.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and
understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in
Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was
still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in
the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face; and while paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own compliments to Mrs.
Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into
the purple and gold reticule by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) side, saying, with significant nods,

<p/>``We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want
opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I
only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is
not offended. You see how delightfully she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) writes. Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is a sweet
creature! You would have doated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), had you gone.--But not a word
more. Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You
remember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment:

<p/>``For when a lady's in the case,
<div class="bookquote">``You know all other things give place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read--mum! a word to
the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set
your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has
quite appeased her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>).''

<p/>And again, on Emma's merely turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head to look at Mrs. Bates's
knitting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) added, in a half whisper,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a
minister of state. I managed it extremely well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every
possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of
the weather and Mrs. Weston, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) found herself abruptly addressed with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) cure does Perry the highest
credit?---LRB-here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.-RRB- Upon my
word, Perry has restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) in a wonderful short time!--Oh! if you had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), as I did, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was at the worst!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--And when Mrs. Bates
was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, <div class="bookquote">``We do not say a word
of any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young
physician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
shortly afterwards began, <div class="bookquote">``since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant
party. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not
seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So
it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think
it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our
collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the
fine weather lasts?--It must be the same party, you know, quite the
same party, not _one_ exception.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being
diverted by the perplexity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first answer to herself, resulting,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say
every thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible
to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--that
is, I do not mean.--But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr.
Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--Such a happy little
circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--Charming young man!--that
is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention to
Jane!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>--And from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) great, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more than commonly thankful delight
towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a
little show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter,
which was now graciously overcome.--After a few whispers, indeed, which
placed it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that
anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth
is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) promised to join me
here, and pay his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) respects to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--That will
be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and
Mr. Elton's time is so engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) really is engaged from morning to
night.--There is no end of people's coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), on some pretence or
other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always
wanting his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.--I do
not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had
half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect
them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar
this fortnight.--However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on
purpose to wait on you all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>And putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hand to screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
words from Emma--<div class="bookquote">``A congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh! yes, quite
indispensable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bates looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), so happily--!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) promised to come to me as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could disengage himself
from Knightley; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and Knightley are shut up together in deep
consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, <div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Elton
gone on foot to Donwell?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will have a hot walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and
Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who
lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have not you mistaken the day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">``I am almost certain that
the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley was at
Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>was the abrupt answer, which
denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--<div class="bookquote">``I do
believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``this is the most troublesome parish that ever
was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your parish there was small,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject
talked of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard
you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the
only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain you
have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we
could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce
perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_
people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word,
if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) words,
not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.
The wish of distinguishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), as far as civility permitted, was very
evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.

<p/>Mr. Elton made his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) appearance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) lady greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with some of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sparkling vivacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an
encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--But
you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should
not stir till my lord and master appeared.--Here have I been sitting
this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal
obedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was suffering, and the
walk he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had had for nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I got to Donwell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Knightley could not be found. Very
odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) this morning, and the
message he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) returned, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should certainly be at home till one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Donwell!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife.--<div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. E., you have not been to
Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley
to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I went
over the fields too---LRB-speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,-RRB- which made
it so much the worse. And then not to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at home! I assure you
I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The
housekeeper declared she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) knew nothing of my being expected.--Very
extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was gone. Perhaps
to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) woods.--Miss
Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,
indeed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not a syllable to say for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Elton, -LRB-feeling the indignity as a wife
ought to do,-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine how he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could do such a thing by you, of
all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to
be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) must have left a message for you, I am
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely
to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,
extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a
creature as his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And
as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) very cheap indeed.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) promised
Wright a receipt, and never sent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met William Larkins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Elton, <div class="bookquote">``as I got near the house,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) told me I should not find his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) master at home, but I did not
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>).--William seemed rather out of humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not know what
was come to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master lately, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could hardly ever get the
speech of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really
is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and it
becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should
have had this hot walk to no purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not do better than go home directly. In
all probability she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.
Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards
Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to
attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out of the room, to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even downstairs; it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
an opportunity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediately made use of, to say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you
not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to
introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might
have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been
impertinent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div>cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought
infinitely more becoming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) than all the elegance of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual
composure--<div class="bookquote">``there would have been no danger. The danger would have
been of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than
by expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, -LRB-speaking more
collectedly,-RRB- with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very
great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those
of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not
disgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could
wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for
myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your
compassion does not stand my friend--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma warmly, and
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you
might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted
even--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--So
cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of
deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.
Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done
quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you
have pleasant accounts from Windsor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--just as
I begin to know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here
till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma,
smiling--<div class="bookquote">``but, excuse me, it must be thought of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>The smile was returned as Jane answered,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, -LRB-I
am sure it will be safe-RRB-, that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill
at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of
deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing
more to wait for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII


<p/>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) safety; and if the
satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by
knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be the mother of a little girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been decided in
wishing for a Miss Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would not acknowledge that it was with
any view of making a match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), hereafter, with either of Isabella's
sons; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was convinced that a daughter would suit both father
and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) grew
older--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks
and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--no
one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and it would be
quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have
their powers in exercise again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
continued--<div class="bookquote">``like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis, in Madame
de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own little
Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) even more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did you, and believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does not indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at all. It will
be the only difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma; <div class="bookquote">``at that rate, what will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will be disagreeable
in infancy, and correct herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) grows older. I am losing all my
bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all
my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be
severe on them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma laughed, and replied: <div class="bookquote">``But I had the assistance of all your
endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether
my own sense would have corrected me without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:--Miss Taylor
gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite
as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what
right has he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) to lecture me?--and I am afraid very natural for you to
feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did
you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the
tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without
doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you were of use to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. <div class="bookquote">``I was very often
influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. I
am very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be
spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
as you have done for me, except falling in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is
thirteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your
saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I
may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I
did not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad
feelings instead of one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches
in such affectionate remembrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>```Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and, from
habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I want
you to call me something else, but I do not know what.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits, about
ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as
you made no objection, I never did it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And cannot you call me `George' now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.' I
will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by
calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added presently, laughing
and blushing--<div class="bookquote">``I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.
I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in
which N. takes M. for better, for worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma grieved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not be more openly just to one important
service which his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) better sense would have rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), to the
advice which would have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the worst of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) womanly
follies--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a
subject.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentioned
between them. This, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) side, might merely proceed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not being
thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy,
and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were
declining. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was aware herself, that, parting under any other
circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on
Isabella's letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might observe that it was so. The pain of being
obliged to practise concealment towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), was very little inferior to
the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.

<p/>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) visitor as could be
expected; on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) first arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) out of spirits, which
appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but,
since that business had been over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) did not appear to find Harriet
different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) before.--Isabella, to be sure,
was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing
with the children, it would not have escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Emma's comforts and
hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John
Knightley were to come down in August, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was invited to remain
till they could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John does not even mention your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley. <div class="bookquote">``Here is
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) answer, if you like to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the answer to the communication of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) intended marriage. Emma
accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
friend was unmentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John enters like a brother into my happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Knightley,
<div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is no complimenter; and though I well know him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to have,
likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is so far from making
flourishes, that any other young woman might think him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) rather cool in
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) writes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) writes like a sensible man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had read the
letter. <div class="bookquote">``I honour his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sincerity. It is very plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) considers the
good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is not
without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as
you think me already. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said any thing to bear a different
construction, I should not have believed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Emma, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) means no such thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) only means--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>interrupted she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), with a sort of serious smile--<div class="bookquote">``much less, perhaps, than
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the
subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma, my dear Emma--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried with more thorough gaiety, <div class="bookquote">``if you fancy your brother
does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,
and hear his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinion. Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be much farther from doing
_you_ justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on
your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not
sink into `poor Emma' with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at once.--His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tender compassion towards
oppressed worth can go no farther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as
John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be
happy together. I am amused by one part of John's letter--did you notice
it?--where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says, that my information did not take him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wholly by
surprize, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was rather in expectation of hearing something of the
kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I understand your brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) only means so far as your having
some thoughts of marrying. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no idea of me. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seems perfectly
unprepared for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, yes--but I am amused that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should have seen so far into my
feelings. What has he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) been judging by?--I am not conscious of any
difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at
this time for my marrying any more than at another.--But it was so, I
suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them
the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much
as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, `Uncle seems
always tired now.'''

<p/>The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other
persons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently
recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to
announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
father at last!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.
Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart would have
failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come
at such a time, and follow up the beginning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to make.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was
forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not make it a
more decided subject of misery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), by a melancholy tone herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
could command, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) first for something strange, and then,
in a few words, said, that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) consent and approbation could be
obtained--which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,
since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr.
Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the
constant addition of that person's company whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) loved, next
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.

<p/>Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) tried
earnestly to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) from it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was reminded, more than once, of
having always said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would never marry, and assured that it would be
a great deal better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to remain single; and told of poor Isabella,
and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must
not class her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them
from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not
going from Hartfield; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should be always there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was introducing
no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was very sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would be a great deal the happier for having Mr.
Knightley always at hand, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were once got used to the idea.--Did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not love Mr. Knightley very much?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sure.--Whom did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ever want to consult on business but Mr.
Knightley?--Who was so useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), who so ready to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) letters,
who so glad to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--Would not he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) like to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always on the spot?--Yes. That
was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should
be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) every day;--but they did see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) every day as it
was.--Why could not they go on as they had done?

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,
the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--To
Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond
praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was soon
used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had all
the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest
approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to
consider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a settled,
and, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal importance
of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed
upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was used to be
guided assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that it would be for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) happiness; and having some
feelings himself which almost admitted it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began to think that some
time or other--in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very
bad if the marriage did take place.

<p/>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in favour of the event.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been extremely surprized,
never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in
urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to the utmost.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as
to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) deserved even her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dearest Emma; and it was in every respect
so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one
respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,
so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely
have attached herself to any other creature, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had herself
been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it
long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma
would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.
Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such
an arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.
Woodhouse had been always felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband's plans and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own, for
a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe
and Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr.
Weston than by herself--but even he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had never been able to finish
the subject better than by saying--<div class="bookquote">``Those matters will take care of
themselves; the young people will find a way.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But here there was
nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was
all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name.
It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without
one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.

<p/>Mrs. Weston, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knee, indulging in such reflections
as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could
increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have
outgrown its first set of caps.

<p/>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to
familiarise the idea to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) quickness of mind.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw the advantages
of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife;
but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
was not far from believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had always foreseen it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is to be a secret, I conclude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``These matters are always a
secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be
told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that
point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the news. Was not she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like a daughter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) eldest
daughter?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and Miss Bates being present, it passed,
of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately
afterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they
had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it
would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening
wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.

<p/>In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and
others might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), the most in luck. One set might recommend their
all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys;
and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,
upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one
habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any
satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only hoped <div class="bookquote">``the young lady's pride would now be contented;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
supposed <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had always meant to catch Knightley if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and,
on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Rather
he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) than I!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--<div class="bookquote">``Poor
Knightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was extremely
concerned; for, though very eccentric, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had a thousand good
qualities.--How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) be so taken in?--Did not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at all in
love--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all
pleasant intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).--How happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been to come and dine
with them whenever they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)! But that would be all over now.--Poor
fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)_. Oh!
no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every
thing.--Extremely disagreeable! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not at all sorry that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living
together. It would never do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew a family near Maple Grove who
had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first
quarter.



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII


<p/>Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would
be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one
morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), when
Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the
first chat of pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began
with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good or bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), quickly, looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know which it ought to be called.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not
to smile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), composing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) features, <div class="bookquote">``I am very much afraid,
my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases
or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I hope but one, on which we do not
think alike.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) paused a moment, again smiling, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eyes fixed on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet
Smith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks flushed at the name, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt afraid of something, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew not what.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) yourself this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have, I
believe, and know the whole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet
Smith marries Robert Martin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes,
in eager gaze, said, <div class="bookquote">``No, this is impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips were closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Knightley; <div class="bookquote">``I have it from Robert
Martin himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) left me not half an hour ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) with the most speaking amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were
the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one
or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not
talk much on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mistake me, you quite mistake me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied, exerting herself.
<div class="bookquote">``It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I
cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,
that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
has even proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) again--yet. You only mean, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) intends it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but
determined decision, <div class="bookquote">``and been accepted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried.--<div class="bookquote">``Well!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--Then having recourse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) workbasket,
in excuse for leaning down her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face, and concealing all the exquisite
feelings of delight and entertainment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be
expressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Well, now tell me every thing; make this
intelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was
more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how
has it been possible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very simple story. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went to town on business three days ago,
and I got him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send
to John.--He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) delivered these papers to John, at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chambers, and was
asked by him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were
going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our
brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could
not resist. They called for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in their way; were all extremely amused;
and my brother asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to dine with them the next day--which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
did--and in the course of that visit -LRB-as I understand-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) found an
opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak
in vain.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) acceptance, as happy even as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is
deserving. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this
morning immediately after breakfast, to report his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) proceedings, first
on my affairs, and then on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own. This is all that I can relate of
the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much
longer history when you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will give you all the minute
particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our
communications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that
Robert Martin's heart seemed for _him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)_, and to _me_, very overflowing;
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that
on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John
Knightley and little John, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) followed with Miss Smith and Henry;
and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith
rather uneasy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must wait a moment, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mad. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) silence disturbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and after observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you
unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your
friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
as you know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) more. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) good sense and good principles would delight
you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend
in better hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) rank in society I would alter if I could, which is
saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William
Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not
to smile too broadly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did--cheerfully answering,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think
Harriet is doing extremely well. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)_ connexions may be worse than
_his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they
are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You
cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared
I was!--for I had reason to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) very lately more determined
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), much more, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to know your friend best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Knightley; <div class="bookquote">``but I
should say she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be
very, very determined against any young man who told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma could not help laughing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I believe
you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you
perfectly sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
I could suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might in time--but can she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) already?--Did not you
misunderstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--You were both talking of other things; of business,
shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of
so many subjects, mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--It was not Harriet's hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was
certain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert
Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong
was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's
side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,
<div class="bookquote">``No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was
really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.
It could not be otherwise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you dare say this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Mr. John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Knightley. <div class="bookquote">``Do you dare to suppose me
so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do
you deserve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with
any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are
you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and
Harriet now are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied, speaking very distinctly, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and that there was no obscurity, nothing
doubtful, in the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) used; and I think I can give you a proof that
it must be so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asked my opinion as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was now to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knew
of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could apply for information of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done,
than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) that I could not. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would endeavour to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) in the course of this day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,
<div class="bookquote">``and most sincerely wish them happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all
Harriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for
Robert Martin's sake, -LRB-whom I have always had reason to believe as much
in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as ever,-RRB- to get acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). I have often
talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes,
indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor
Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations,
I am convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being an artless, amiable girl, with very good
notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happiness in
the affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have no
doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) may thank you for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head.--<div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor Harriet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more
praise than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) deserved.

<p/>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not sorry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to be alone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind was in a
state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be
collected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
could be fit for nothing rational.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the
horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.

<p/>The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sensations may be
imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of
Harriet's welfare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was really in danger of becoming too happy for
security.--What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own.
Nothing, but that the lessons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) past folly might teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) humility
and circumspection in future.

<p/>Serious she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, very serious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thankfulness, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the
very midst of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the
doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!

<p/>Now there would be pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) returning--Every thing would be a
pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.

<p/>High in the rank of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the
reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would
soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to
practise, might soon be over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could now look forward to giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
that full and perfect confidence which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) disposition was most ready to
welcome as a duty.

<p/>In the gayest and happiest spirits she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) set forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father; not
always listening, but always agreeing to what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; and, whether in
speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be
disappointed.

<p/>They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly
had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks
for coming, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the
blind, of two figures passing near the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston. <div class="bookquote">``I was just going to
tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arrive this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the
day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing
recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a
consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all
sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that
Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had long
felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) with Jane,
would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the
party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a
want of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank
Churchill to draw near her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message
in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less
willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, most happy to begin, <div class="bookquote">``not in the least. I am
particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy
in person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heart, and continued some time to speak with
serious feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gratitude and happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) looking well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) eyes towards Jane.
<div class="bookquote">``Better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston
doat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after
mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) named the name of
Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``without extreme shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``is all mine, or ought to be. But is it
possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, you
had none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had the smallest, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I
had--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong
things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no
service.--It would have been a much better transgression had I broken
the bond of secrecy and told you every thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not now worth a regret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have some hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>resumed he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a
visit at Randalls; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wants to be introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). When the Campbells
are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,
till we may carry her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have not
once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay
thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) cried,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! by the bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) voice, and looking demure for the
moment--<div class="bookquote">``I hope Mr. Knightley is well?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) paused.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) coloured and
laughed.--<div class="bookquote">``I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish
in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you that
I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is
a man whom I cannot presume to praise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to go on in the same style; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mind was the next moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own concerns and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own Jane,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) next words were,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and
yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fair. It is a
most uncommon complexion, with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dark eye-lashes and hair--a most
distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour
enough for beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always admired her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) complexion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, archly; <div class="bookquote">``but
do not I remember the time when you found fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for being so
pale?--When we first began to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).--Have you quite forgotten?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help
saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you
had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am
sure it was a consolation to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most
miserable wretch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a
source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us
all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the
truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same
situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If not in our dispositions,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) presently added, with a look of true
sensibility, <div class="bookquote">``there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids
fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) answered, warmly. <div class="bookquote">``No, not true on your side. You can
have no superior, but most true on mine.--She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) is a complete angel. Look
at her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>). Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
throat. Observe her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) is looking up at my father.--You will
be glad to hear -LRB-inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, and whispering seriously-RRB- that my
uncle means to give her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set.
I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be
beautiful in her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) dark hair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very beautiful, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke so kindly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)
gratefully burst out,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent
looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should
certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account
of a little alarm she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been under, the evening before, from the
infant's appearing not quite well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been foolish,
but it had alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been within half a minute of sending
for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been
almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had
been perfectly well again. This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) history; and particularly
interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very much for
thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not done
it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the
slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) could not be
too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,
very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had
seen it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Frank Churchill caught the name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to Emma, and trying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spoke, to catch Miss
Fairfax's eye. <div class="bookquote">``My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.
Perry?--Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) been here this morning?--And how does he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) travel now?--Has
he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse/Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma soon recollected, and understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) joined in the
laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) too was really
hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), though trying to seem deaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such an extraordinary dream of mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I can never think of
it without laughing.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) hears us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see
it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) cheek, her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) vain attempt to frown. Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>). Do
not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) own letter,
which sent me the report, is passing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) eye--that the whole
blunder is spread before her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) can attend to nothing else,
though pretending to listen to the others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly
remained as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), and said in a conscious, low, yet
steady voice,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They
_will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but
Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving
Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
felt, that pleased as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been to see Frank Churchill, and really
regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did with friendship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never been more
sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness
of this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated
contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) worth which this comparison produced.

<p/>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a
momentary doubt of its being possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to be really cured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from
unbiased inclination, it was not long that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to suffer from the
recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party
from London, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour
alone with Harriet, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable
as it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,
and was now forming all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) views of happiness.

<p/>Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:
but having once owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been presumptuous and silly, and
self-deceived, before, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pain and confusion seemed to die away with
the words, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) without a care for the past, and with the
fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend's
approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by
meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet was
most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the
dinner the next day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.
But what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now
acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
continuing to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever
be unintelligible to Emma.

<p/>The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fresh
reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) proved
to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the
comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to
have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility
which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to
be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what
a connexion had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the
Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy,
unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.

<p/>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated
liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted
with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fully
acknowledged in him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) all the appearance of sense and worth which could
bid fairest for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no doubt of Harriet's
happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and in the home he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and
improvement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be placed in the midst of those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>),
and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety,
and occupied enough for cheerfulness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be never led into
temptation, nor left for it to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be respectable
and happy; and Emma admitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be the luckiest creature in the
world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a
man;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.

<p/>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) engagements with the Martins,
was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The
intimacy between her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and Emma must sink; their friendship must change
into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be,
and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural
manner.

<p/>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as
no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) stood before them,
could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) scarcely saw Mr. Elton,
but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on
herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of
the three, were the first to be married.

<p/>Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the
comforts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills
were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.

<p/>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by
Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought
to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to
allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was
the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in
approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced
to consent?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a
distant event.

<p/>When first sounded on the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was so miserable, that they were
almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
began to think it was to be, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not prevent it--a very
promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
was not happy. Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) appeared so much otherwise, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's
courage failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not bear to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) suffering, to know
him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fancying himself neglected; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) understanding almost
acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when
once the event were over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) distress would be soon over too, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
hesitated--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not proceed.

<p/>In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden
illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another
way.--Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
turkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in
the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.
Woodhouse's fears.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every
night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the
Mr. Knightleys, commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) fullest dependence. While either of them
protected him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>), Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must
be in London again by the end of the first week in November.

<p/>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,
cheerful consent than his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the
moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was able to fix her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called
on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to
join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.

<p/>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have
no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars
detailed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very
inferior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own.--<div class="bookquote">``Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a
most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) heard of it.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--But,
in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,
the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the
ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.
